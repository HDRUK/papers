    "abstract": "BackgroundDuring infectious disease epidemics, a key question is whether cases travelling to new locations will trigger local outbreaks. The risk of this occurring depends on a range of factors, such as the transmissibility of the pathogen, the susceptibility of the host population and, crucially, the effectiveness of local surveillance in detecting cases and preventing onward spread. For many pathogens, presymptomatic and/or asymptomatic (together referred to here as nonsymptomatic) transmission can occur, making effective surveillance challenging. In this study, using COVID-19 as a case-study, we show how the risk of local outbreaks can be assessed when nonsymptomatic transmission can occur.\n\nMethodsWe construct a branching process model that includes nonsymptomatic transmission, and explore the effects of interventions targeting nonsymptomatic or symptomatic hosts when surveillance resources are limited. Specifically, we consider whether the greatest reductions in local outbreak risks are achieved by increasing surveillance and control targeting nonsymptomatic or symptomatic cases, or a combination of both.\n\nFindingsSeeking to increase surveillance of symptomatic hosts alone is typically not the optimal strategy for reducing outbreak risks. Adopting a strategy that combines an enhancement of surveillance of symptomatic cases with efforts to find and isolate nonsymptomatic hosts leads to the largest reduction in the probability that imported cases will initiate a local outbreak.\n\nInterpretationDuring epidemics of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, effective surveillance for nonsymptomatic hosts can be crucial to prevent local outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "School closures due to the COVID-19 global pandemic are likely to have a range of negative consequences spanning the domains of child development, education and health, in addition to the widening of inequalities and inequities. Research is required to improve understanding of the impact of school closures on the education, health and wellbeing of pupils and school staff, the challenges posed during reopening and importantly to identify how countries can ensure a safe return to education and to inform policy. This qualitative study aimed to reflect on the experience of primary school staff (pupils aged 3-11) in Wales regarding school closures and the initial reopening of schools and to identify recommendations for the future. A total of 208 school staff completed a national online survey through the HAPPEN primary school network, consisting of questions about school closures, the phased reopening of schools and a return to full-time education. Thematic analysis of survey responses identified five recommendations; (i) prioritise the health and wellbeing of pupils and staff. This includes more focus on wellbeing activities and less focus on attainment/assessments and protecting staff breaks to promote workplace wellbeing; (ii) focus on enabling parental engagement and support. Introduce support sessions for parents and include regular check ins during periods of home learning; (iii) improve digital competence amongst pupils, teachers and parents. Ensure the provision of equipment and training in building digital skills. Offer a combination of paper-based and digital home learning activities; (iv) consider opportunities for smaller class sizes and additional staffing. Ensure support is directed to need whilst providing pastoral care; and (v) improve the mechanism of communication between schools and families, and between government and schools. Ensure that schools receive advance notice of local or national changes in guidance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 serology is used to identify prior infection at individual and at population level. Extended longitudinal studies with multi-timepoint sampling to evaluate dynamic changes in antibody levels are required to identify the time horizon in which these applications of serology are valid, and to explore the longevity of protective humoral immunity.\n\nMethodsHealth-care workers were recruited to a prospective cohort study from the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic peak in London, undergoing weekly symptom screen, viral PCR and blood sampling over 16-21 weeks. Serological analysis (n=12,990) was performed using semi-quantitative Euroimmun IgG to viral spike S1 domain and Roche total antibody to viral nucleocapsid protein (NP) assays. Comparisons were made to previously reported pseudovirus neutralising antibody measurements.\n\nFindingsA total of 157/729 (21.5%) participants developed positive SARS-CoV-2 serology by one or other assay, of whom 31.0% were asymptomatic and there were no deaths. Peak Euroimmun anti-S1 and Roche anti-NP measurements correlated (r=0.57, p<0.0001) but only anti-S1 measurements correlated with near-contemporary pseudovirus neutralising antibody titres (measured at 16-18 weeks, r=0.57, p<0.0001). By 21 weeks follow-up, 31/143 (21.7%) anti-S1 and 6/150 (4.0%) anti-NP measurements reverted to negative. Mathematical modelling suggested faster clearance of anti-S1 compared to anti-NP (median half-life of 2.5 weeks versus 4.0 weeks), earlier transition to lower levels of antibody production (median of 8 versus 13 weeks), and greater reductions in relative antibody production rate after the transition (median of 35% versus 50%).\n\nInterpretationMild SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with heterogenous serological responses in Euroimmun anti-S1 and Roche anti-NP assays. Anti-S1 responses showed faster rates of clearance, more rapid transition from high to low level production rate and greater reduction in production rate after this transition. The application of individual assays for diagnostic and epidemiological serology requires validation in time series analysis.\n\nFundingCharitable donations via Barts Charity\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv for [\"antibody\" OR \"serology\"] AND [\"SARS-CoV-2\" OR \"COVID-19\"]. The available literature highlights widespread use of serology to detect recent SARS-CoV-2 infection in individual patients and in population epidemiological surveys. Antibody to virus spike protein S1 domain is widely reported to correlate with neutralising antibody titres. The existing assays have good sensitivity to detect seroconversion within 14 days of incident infection, but the available longitudinal studies have reported variable rates of decline in antibody levels and reversion to undetectable levels in some people over 3 months. High frequency multi-time point serology data for different antibody targets or assays in longitudinal cohorts from the time of incident infection to greater than 3 months follow up are lacking.\n\nAdded value of this studyWe combine detailed longitudinal serology using the Euroimmun anti-S1 and Roche anti-nucleocapsid protein (NP) assays in 731 health care workers from the time of the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic peak in London, UK. In 157 seroconverters (using either assay) we show substantial heterogeneity in semiquantitative antibody measurements over time between individuals and between assays. Mathematical modelling of individual participant antibody production and clearance rates in individuals with at least 8 data points over 21 weeks showed anti-S1 antibodies to have a faster clearance rate, earlier transition from the initial antibody production rate to lower rates, and greater reduction in antibody production rate after this transition, compared to anti-NP antibodies as measured by these assays. As a result, Euroimmun anti-S1 measurements peaked earlier and then reduced more rapidly than Roche anti-NP measurements. In this study, these differences led to 21% anti-S1 sero-reversion, compared to 4% anti-NP sero-reversion over 4-5 months.\n\nImplications of all of the available evidenceThe rapid decline in anti-S1 antibodies measured by the Euroimmun assay following infection limits its application for diagnostic and epidemiological screening. If generalisable, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that anti-S1 mediated humoral immunity may not be sustained in some people beyond the initial post-infective period. Further work is required to understand the mechanisms behind the heterogeneity in antibody kinetics between individuals to SARS-CoV-2. Our data point to differential mechanisms regulating humoral immunity against these two viral targets.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding resource use for COVID-19 is critical. We conducted a population-based cohort study using public health data to describe COVID-19 associated age- and sex-specific acute care use, length of stay (LOS), and mortality.\n\nMethodsWe used Ontarios Case and Contact Management (CCM) Plus database of individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 in Ontario from March 1 to September 30, 2020 to determine age- and sex-specific hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) use, LOS, and mortality. We stratified analyses by month of infection to study temporal trends and conducted subgroup analyses by long-term care residency.\n\nResultsDuring the observation period, 56,476 COVID-19 cases were reported (72% < 60 years, 52% female). The proportion of cases shifted from older populations (> 60 years) to younger populations (10-39 years) over time. Overall, 10% of individuals were hospitalized, of those 22% were admitted to ICU, and 60% of those used IMV. Mean LOS for individuals in the ward, ICU without IMV, and ICU with IMV was 12.8, 8.5, 20.5 days, respectively. Mortality for individuals receiving care in the ward, ICU without IMV, and ICU with IMV was 24%, 30%, and 45%, respectively. All outcomes varied by age and decreased over time, overall and within age groups.\n\nInterpretationThis descriptive study shows acute care use and mortality varying by age, and decreasing between March and September in Ontario. Improvements in clinical practice and changing risk distributions among those infected may contribute to fewer severe outcomes among those infected with COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is a major, urgent, and ongoing threat to global health. Globally more than 24 million have been infected and the disease has claimed more than a million lives as of October 2020. Predicting which patients will need respiratory support is important to guiding individual patient treatment and also to ensuring sufficient resources are available. We evaluated the ability of six common Early Warning Scores (EWS) to identify respiratory deterioration defined as the need for advanced respiratory support (high-flow nasal oxygen, continuous positive airways pressure, non-invasive ventilation, intubation) within a prediction window of 24 hours. We show these scores perform sub-optimally at this specific task. Therefore, we develop an alternative Early Warning Score based on a Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT) algorithm that is able to predict deterioration within the next 24 hours with high AUROC 94% and an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 70%, 96%, 70%, respectively. Our GBT model outperformed the best EWS (LDTEWS:NEWS), increasing the AUROC by 14%. Our GBT model makes the prediction based on the current and baseline measures of routinely available vital signs and blood tests.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe impact of biometric covariates on risk for adverse outcomes of COVID-19 disease was assessed by numerous observational studies on unstratified cohorts, which show great heterogeneity. However, multilevel evaluations to find possible complex, e. g. non-monotonic multi-variate patterns reflecting mutual interference of parameters are missing. We used a more detailed, computational analysis to investigate the influence of biometric differences on mortality and disease evolution among severely ill COVID-19 patients.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed a group of COVID-19 patients requiring Intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. For further analysis, the study group was segmented into six subgroups according to BMI and age. To link the BMI/age derived subgroups with risk factors, we performed an enrichment analysis of diagnostic parameters and comorbidities. To suppress spurious patterns, multiple segmentations were analyzed and integrated into a consensus score for each analysis step.\n\nResultsWe analyzed 81 COVID-19 patients, of whom 67 required MV. Mean mortality was 35.8 %. We found a complex, non-monotonic interaction between age, BMI and mortality. A subcohort of patients with younger age and intermediate BMI exhibited a strongly reduced mortality risk (p < 0.001), while differences in all other groups were not significant. Univariate impacts of BMI or age on mortality were missing. Comparing MV with non-MV patients, we found an enrichment of baseline CRP, PCT and D-Dimers within the MV-group, but not when comparing survivors vs. non-survivors within the MV patient group.\n\nConclusionsThe aim of this study was to get a more detailed insight into the influence of biometric covariates on the outcome of COVID-19 patients with high degree of severity. We found that survival in MV is affected by complex interactions of covariates differing to the reported covariates, which are hidden in generic, non-stratified studies on risk factors. Hence, our study suggests that a detailed, multivariate pattern analysis on larger patient cohorts reflecting the specific disease stages might reveal more specific patterns of risk factors supporting individually adapted treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNursing homes and other long term care facilities have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Strategies are urgently needed to reduce transmission in these vulnerable populations. We aimed to evaluate the reduction in transmission in nursing homes achieved through contact-targeted interventions and testing and to evaluate the effectiveness of two types of screening tests conducted with varying frequency: 1) rapid antigen testing and 2) PCR testing.\n\nMethodsWe developed an agent-based Susceptible-Exposed- Infectious(Asymptomatic/Symptomatic)-Recovered (SEIR) model to examine SARS-CoV-2 transmission in nursing homes. Residents and staff are modelled individually; residents are split into two cohorts based on COVID-19 diagnosis. In the resident cohorting intervention, recovered residents are moved back from the COVID (infected) cohort to the non-COVID (susceptible/uninfected) cohort. In the immunity-based staffing intervention, recovered staff, who we assume have protective immunity, are assigned to work in the non-COVID cohort, while susceptible staff work in the COVID cohort and are assumed to have high levels of protection from personal protective equipment. These interventions aim to reduce the fraction of peoples contacts that are presumed susceptible (and therefore potentially infected) and replace them with recovered (immune) contacts.\n\nResultsThe frequency and type of testing has a larger impact on the size of outbreaks than the cohorting and staffing interventions. The most effective testing strategies modeled are daily antigen testing of everyone and daily antigen testing of staff with weekly PCR testing for residents. Under all screening testing strategies, the immunity-based staffing intervention reduces the final size of the outbreak. The resident cohorting intervention reduces the final outbreak size under some, but not all, testing scenarios.\n\nConclusionsIncreasing the frequency of screening testing of all residents and staff, or even staff alone, in nursing homes has the potential to greatly reduce outbreaks in this vulnerable setting. Immunity-based staffing can further reduce spread at little or no additional cost and becomes particularly important when daily testing is not feasible.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere has long been uncertainty about the relative size of the \"dark\" numbers, the infected population sizes and the actual fatality rate in the COVID-19 pandemic and thus how the pandemic impacts the healthcare system. As a result it was initially predicted that the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark would overwhelm the healthcare system and thus both the diagnosis and treatment of other hospital patients were compromised for an extended period.\n\nAimTo develop a robust method for reliable estimation of the epidemic and the healthcare system load in Denmark, both retrospectively and prospectively. To do this a new pandemic simulation had to be developed that accounts for the size and the infection impact of the infectious incubating and asymptomatic infected individuals (dark numbers).\n\nMethodsOur epidemic simulation is based on a SEIRS (Susceptible - Exposed - Infected - Recovered - Susceptible) model, coupled to a simple healthcare model that also includes deaths outside hospital settings. The SEIRS model has separate assessments of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases with different immunological memories. The main data used for parameter estimation in the models are hospital and ICU occupations, death data, serological data of antibody prevalence from the onset through August 2020 together with hospital data and clinical data about the viral infection. Optimal model parameters are in part identified by Monte Carlo based Least Square Error methods while micro-outbreaks are modeled by noise and explored in Monte Carlo simulations. Estimates for the infected population sizes are obtained by using a quasi steady state method.\n\nResultsThe age adjusted antibody prevalence in the general population in May 2020 was 1.37%, which yields a relative frequency of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases of 1 to 5.2. Due to the large asymptomatic population found, the actual mortality rate to date is 0.4%. However, with no behavioral and policy restrictions the COVID-19 death toll would have more than doubled the national average yearly deaths within a year. The transmission rate [R]0 was 5.4 in the initial free epidemic period, 0.4 in the lock-down period and 0.8 -1.0 in the successive re-opening periods through August 2020. The estimated infected population size July 15 to August 15 was 2, 100 and 12, 200 for October 1 - 20, 2020. The efficiency of the applied daily testing strategy for both periods are estimated to be 40% of the PCR observable infected. Of more theoretical interest we demonstrate how the critical infection parameters for COVID-19 are tightly related in a so-called iso-symptomatic infection diagram.\n\nConclusionsOur simulation may be useful if a major infection wave occurs in the winter season as it could make robust estimates both for the scale of an ongoing expanding epidemic and for the expected load on the healthcare system. Our simulation may also be useful to assess a future controlled epidemic, e.g. as a basis for evaluating different testing strategies based on estimated infected population sizes. Finally, we believe our simulation can be adjusted and scaled to other regions and countries, which we illustrate with Spain and the US.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesTo explore parents perceptions of COVID-19-like symptoms in their child and attitudes towards isolating from others in the household when unwell.\n\nStudy DesignQualitative, semi-structured interviews.\n\nMethods30 semi-structured telephone interviews with parents of children between 4 and 18 years.\n\nResultsWe found four themes relating to symptom attribution ( normalising symptoms,  err on the side of caution,  experience of temperature,  symptoms not normal for us). In general, parents were more likely to attribute symptoms to COVID-19 if a temperature was present or the symptoms were perceived as  unusual for their family. Four themes relating to self-isolation ( difficult to prevent contact with children,  isolation would be no different to lockdown life,  ability to get food and supplies,  limited space). Parents believed they would find isolation within the household difficult or impossible if they had dependent children, had limited space or could not shop for groceries.\n\nConclusionsThe findings highlight complexities in symptom perception, attribution, and household isolation. We suggest that they can be overcome by a) providing better guidance on what symptoms require action, b) providing guidance as to how to prevent infection within the household, and c) by supporting families with grocery shopping through a potential second or third wave.",

Participants self-reported time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), walking, sitting and sleep prior to lockdown (T1), during the first national lockdown (T2) and as restrictions initially started to ease (T3). For each 24-hour movement behavior, category-shifts are reported (positive, negative or did not change), as well as the percentage of participants recording positive/negative changes across clusters of behaviors and the percentage of participants recording improvement or maintenance of change across time. From T1 to T2 walking decreased, whereas MVPA, sitting and sleep increased, from T2 to T3 levels returned to pre-lockdown for all but MVPA. Participants who changed one behavior positively were more likely to report a positive change in another and 50% of those who reported positive changes from T1 to T2 maintained or improved further when restrictions started to ease. The current study showed that a large proportion of the sample reported positive changes, most notably those displaying initially poor levels of each behavior. These findings will inform salutogenic intervention development.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has been ongoing for close to a year, with second waves occurring presently and many viewing a vaccine as the most likely way to curb successive waves and promote herd immunity. Reaching herd immunity status likely necessitates that children, as well as their parents, receive a vaccine targeting SARS-CoV-2. In this exploratory study, we investigated the demographic, experiential, and psychological factors associated with the anticipated likelihood and speed of having children receive a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in a sample of 455 Canadian families (857 children). Using linear mixed effects and proportional odds logistic regression models, we demonstrated that older parental age, living in the Prairies (relative to Central Canada), more complete child and parental vaccination history, more positive attitudes towards vaccines generally, higher psychological avoidance of the pandemic and a greater tendency to prioritize the risks of the disease relative to the risks of side effects (i.e., lower omission bias), were associated with higher likelihoods of intention to vaccinate participants children. In some models, subjective evaluations of proximal COVID-19 risk and higher levels of state anxiety were associated with increased likelihood of having children vaccinated. Faster speed of intended vaccination was predicted by a similar constellation of variables, with higher SES emerging as a trend-level predictor of vaccination speed. Results are discussed with respect to public health knowledge mobilization.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionWhile evidence has emerged concerning the impact of Covid-19 on the general population and the challenges facing health services, much less is known regarding how the pandemic has directly affected the delivery of mental health nursing care.\n\nAimThis paper aims to explore how Covid-19 has affected the ability of mental health nurses to deliver care in community and inpatient mental health services in the UK.\n\nMethodWe investigated staff reports regarding the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on mental healthcare and mental health service users in the UK, using a mixed methods online survey. A total of 897 nurses across a range of inpatient and community settings participated.\n\nDiscussionKey themes within the data explore: new ways of working; remote working; risks of infection/infection control challenges; and the impact on service users. Targeted guidelines are required to support mental health nurses providing care and support during a pandemic to people in severe mental distress, often in unsuitable environments.\n\nImplications for PracticeService developments need to occur alongside tailored guidance and support for staff welfare supported by clear leadership. These findings identify areas requiring attention and investment to prepare for future crises and the consequences of the pandemic.\n\nAccessible SummaryO_ST_ABSWhat is known on the subject?C_ST_ABSDuring the Covid-19 pandemic there has been research considering the impact on medical healthcare professionals and the mental health needs of the general population. However, limited focus has been placed on mental health services or mental health staff providing care in the community and in hospitals. Whilst nurses make up the largest section of the mental health workforce in the UK, the impact that this pandemic has had on their work has been largely ignored.\n\nWhat the paper adds to existing knowledge?This paper provides a unique insight into the experiences and impact that the Covid-19 pandemic has had on mental health nurses across a range of community and inpatient settings to understand what has changed in their work and the care they can and do provide during this crisis. This includes exploring how services have changed, the move to remote working, the impact of the protective equipment crisis on nurses, and the difficult working conditions facing those in inpatient settings where there is minimal guidance provided.\n\nWhat are the implications for practice?By understanding the impact the pandemic has had on mental health nursing care, we can understand the gaps in guidance that exist, the challenges being faced, and the impact the crisis has had on care for mental health service users. By doing so we can plan for the ongoing nature of this pandemic as well as the aftermath that the crisis may leave for our service users and workforce alike.\n\nRelevance StatementThis paper provides insight into the impact that the Covid-19 pandemic has had on the service and care that mental health nurses are expected to and can provide. As a workforce that often requires ongoing face to face contact with service users, many in serious distress, in inpatient and community settings, it is important that we understand their experiences and the challenges and risks that face this workforce. This will enable us to ensure that future planning, guidance, support and safeguarding can take place during the ongoing and future crises.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNew York State (NYS) has been an epicenter for both COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS epidemics. Persons Living with diagnosed HIV (PLWDH) may be more prone to COVID-19 infection and severe outcomes, yet few population-based studies have assessed the extent to which PLWDH are diagnosed, hospitalized, and have died with COVID-19, relative to non-PLWDH.\n\nMethodsNYS HIV surveillance, COVID-19 laboratory confirmed diagnoses, and hospitalization databases were matched. COVID-19 diagnoses, hospitalization, and in-hospital death rates comparing PLWDH to non-PLWDH were computed, with unadjusted rate ratios (RR) and indirect standardized RR (sRR), adjusting for sex, age, and region. Adjusted RR (aRR) for outcomes among PLWDH were assessed by age/CD4-defined HIV disease stage, and viral load suppression, using Poisson regression models.\n\nResultsFrom March 1-June 7, 2020, PLWDH were more frequently diagnosed with COVID-19 than non-PLWDH in unadjusted (RR [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 1.43[1.38-1.48), 2,988 PLWDH], but not in adjusted comparisons (sRR [95% CI]: 0.94[0.91-0.97]). Per-population COVID-19 hospitalization was higher among PLWDH (RR [95% CI]: 2.61[2.45-2.79], sRR [95% CI]: 1.38[1.29-1.47], 896 PLWDH), as was in-hospital death (RR [95% CI]: 2.55[2.22-2.93], sRR [95%CI]: 1.23 [1.07-1.40], 207 PLWDH), albeit not among those hospitalized (sRR [95% CI]: 0.96[0.83-1.09]). Among PLWDH, hospitalization risk increased with disease progression from HIV Stage 1 to Stage 2 (aRR [95% CI]:1.27[1.09-1.47]) and Stage 3 (aRR [95% CI]: 1.54[1.24-1.91]), and for those virally unsuppressed (aRR [95% CI]: 1.54[1.24-1.91]).\n\nConclusionPLWDH experienced poorer COVID-related outcomes relative to non-PLWDH, with 1-in-522 PLWDH dying with COVID-19, seemingly driven by higher rates of severe disease requiring hospitalization.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow at an unprecedented rate. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection than the general population but risk factors for HCW infection are not well described.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a prospective sero-epidemiological study of HCWs at a UK teaching hospital using a SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay. Risk factors for seropositivity were analysed using multivariate logistic regression.\n\nFindings410/5,698 (7{middle dot}2%) staff tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Seroprevalence was higher in those working in designated COVID-19 areas compared with other areas (9{middle dot}47% versus 6{middle dot}16%) Healthcare assistants (aOR 2{middle dot}06 [95%CI 1{middle dot}14-3{middle dot}71]; p=0{middle dot}016) and domestic and portering staff (aOR 3{middle dot}45 [95% CI 1{middle dot}07-11{middle dot}42]; p=0{middle dot}039) had significantly higher seroprevalence than other staff groups after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity and COVID-19 working location. Staff working in acute medicine and medical sub-specialities were also at higher risk (aOR 2{middle dot}07 [95% CI 1{middle dot}31-3{middle dot}25]; p<0{middle dot}002). Staff from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds had an aOR of 1{middle dot}65 (95% CI 1{middle dot}32 - 2{middle dot}07; p<0{middle dot}001) compared to white staff; this increased risk was independent of COVID-19 area working. The only symptoms significantly associated with seropositivity in a multivariable model were loss of sense of taste or smell, fever and myalgia; 31% of staff testing positive reported no prior symptoms.\n\nInterpretationRisk of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst HCWs is heterogeneous and influenced by COVID-19 working location, role, age and ethnicity. Increased risk amongst BAME staff cannot be accounted for solely by occupational factors.\n\nFundingWellcome Trust, Addenbrookes Charitable Trust, National Institute for Health Research, Academy of Medical Sciences, the Health Foundation and the NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.\n\nResearch in context\n\nEvidence before this studySpecific risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) are not well defined. Additionally, it is not clear how population level risk factors influence occupational risk in defined demographic groups. Only by identifying these factors can we mitigate and reduce the risk of occupational SARS-CoV-2 infection. We performed a review of the evidence for HCW-specific risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We searched PubMed with the terms \"SARS-CoV-2\" OR \"COVID-19\" AND \"Healthcare worker\" OR \"Healthcare Personnel\" AND \"Risk factor\" to identify any studies published in any language between December 2019 and September 2020. The search identified 266 studies and included a meta-analysis and two observational studies assessing HCW cohort seroprevalence data. Seroprevalence and risk factors for HCW infections varied between studies, with contradictory findings. In the two serological studies, one identified a significant increased risk of seroprevalence in those working with COVID-19 patients (Eyre et al 2020), as well as associations with job role and department. The other study (Dimcheff et al 2020) found no significant association between seropositivity and any identified demographic or occupational factor. A meta-analysis of HCW (Gomez-Ochoa et al 2020) assessed >230,000 participants as a pooled analysis, including diagnoses by both RT-PCR and seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and found great heterogeneity in study design and reported contradictory findings. Of note, they report a seropositivity rate of 7% across all studies reporting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCWs. Nurses were the most frequently affected healthcare personnel and staff working in non-emergency inpatient settings were the most frequently affected group. Our search found no prospective studies systematically evaluating HCW specific risk factors based entirely on seroprevalence data.\n\nAdded value of this studyOur prospective cohort study of almost 6,000 HCWs at a large UK teaching hospital strengthens previous findings from UK-based cohorts in identifying an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure amongst HCWs. Specifically, factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 exposure include caring for confirmed COVID-19 cases and identifying as being within specific ethnic groups (BAME staff). We further delineated the risk amongst BAME staff and demonstrate that occupational factors alone do not account for all of the increased risk amongst this group. We demonstrate for the first time that healthcare assistants represent a key at-risk occupational group, and challenge previous findings of significantly higher risk amongst nursing staff. Seroprevalence in staff not working in areas with confirmed COVID-19 patients was only marginally higher than that of the general population within the same geographical region. This observation could suggest the increased risk amongst HCWs arises through occupational exposure to confirmed cases and could account for the overall higher seroprevalence in HCWs, rather than purely the presence of staff in healthcare facilities. Over 30% of seropositive staff had not reported symptoms consistent with COVID-19, and in those who did report symptoms, differentiating COVID-19 from other causes based on symptom data alone was unreliable.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceInternational efforts to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst HCWs need to be prioritised. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst HCWs is heterogenous but also follows demonstrable patterns. Potential mechanisms to reduce the risk for staff working in areas with confirmed COVID-19 patients include improved training in hand hygiene and personal protective equipment (PPE), better access to high quality PPE, and frequent asymptomatic testing. Wider asymptomatic testing in healthcare facilities has the potential to reduce spread of SARS-CoV-2 within hospitals, thereby reducing patient and staff risk and limiting spread between hospitals and into the wider community. The increased risk of COVID-19 amongst BAME staff cannot be explained by purely occupational factors; however, the increased risk amongst minority ethnic groups identified here was stark and necessitates further evaluation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe current increase in the spread of (SARS-CoV-2) critically needs a multitarget diagnostic assays to promote analytical sensitivity to facilitate the public health actions.\n\nObjectiveThe aim of this study was to develop a new primer-probe set targeting N gene of SARS-CoV-2 to improve the sensitivity for detection of COVID-19(Corona Virus Disease 2019)in multiplex rRT-PCR (Reversetranscript Realtime PCR) and ddPCR (Droplet Digital PCR).\n\nResultsWe designed primers/probes set N(LZU3) targeting the N gene of 2019-nCov and proved its sensitivity in both rRT-PCR and ddPCR. When the quantity of template was 105 copies/reaction, the mean Ct value of N(LZU3) was 32.563, the detection rate was 91.7%. If the quantity of template was 52.5 copies/reaction, the mean Ct value of N(LZU3) was 33.835, and the detection rate was 83.3%, which were similar with that of N(CDC) and N(USA). The calculated lower limit of detection (LOD) of the new primer-probe set N(LZU3) used in rRT-PCR was 118 copies/reaction. We also did one-step ddPCR for detection the same serial dilution of RNA template. It shows good linearity for primer/probe sets N(LZU3). The calculated lower limit of detection (LOD) of N(LZU3) was 22.4 copies/reaction, which was 1.12 copies/ul.\n\nConclusionThe novel primer-probe set(LZU3) targeting N gene of SARS-CoV-2 could be both used in rRT-PCR and ddPCR with better sensitivity, furthermore, ddPCR method had higer sensitivity than rRT-PCR, hence it could significantly improve SARS-CoV-2 detection efficiency in low virus load and asymptomatic infection.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe genome of SARS-CoV-2 is susceptible to mutations during viral replication due to the errors generated by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. These mutations enable the SARS-CoV-2 to evolve into new strains. Viral quasispecies emerge from de novo mutations that occur in individual patients. In combination, these sets of viral mutations provide distinct genetic fingerprints that reveal the patterns of transmission and have utility in contract tracing.\n\nMethodsLeveraging thousands of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we performed a viral pangenome analysis to identify conserved genomic sequences. We used a rapid and highly efficient computational approach that relies on k-mers, short tracts of sequence, instead of conventional sequence alignment. Using this method, we annotated viral mutation signatures that were associated with specific strains. Based on these highly conserved viral sequences, we developed a rapid and highly scalable targeted sequencing assay to identify mutations, detect quasispecies and identify mutation signatures from patients. These results were compared to the pangenome genetic fingerprints.\n\nResultsWe built a k-mer index for thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and identified conserved genomics regions and landscape of mutations across thousands of virus genomes. We delineated mutation profiles spanning common genetic fingerprints (the combination of mutations in a viral assembly) and rare ones that occur in only small fraction of patients. We developed a targeted sequencing assay by selecting primers from the conserved viral genome regions to flank frequent mutations. Using a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples, we identified genetic fingerprints consisting of strain-specific mutations seen across populations and de novo quasispecies mutations localized to individual infections. We compared the mutation profiles of viral samples undergoing analysis with the features of the pangenome.\n\nConclusionsWe conducted an analysis for viral mutation profiles that provide the basis of genetic fingerprints. Our study linked pangenome analysis with targeted deep sequenced SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples. We identified quasispecies mutations occurring within individual patients, mutations demarcating dominant species and the prevalence of mutation signatures, of which a significant number were relatively unique. Analysis of these genetic fingerprints may provide a way of conducting molecular contact tracing.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody measurements can be used to estimate the proportion of a population exposed or infected and may be informative about the risk of future infection. Previous estimates of the duration of antibody responses vary.\n\nMethodsWe present 6 months of data from a longitudinal seroprevalence study of 3217 UK healthcare workers (HCWs). Serial measurements of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid were obtained. Bayesian mixed linear models were used to investigate antibody waning and associations with age, gender, ethnicity, previous symptoms and PCR results.\n\nResultsIn this cohort of working age HCWs, antibody levels rose to a peak at 24 (95% credibility interval, CrI 19-31) days post-first positive PCR test, before beginning to fall. Considering 452 IgG seropositive HCWs over a median of 121 days (maximum 171 days) from their maximum positive IgG titre, the mean estimated antibody half-life was 85 (95%CrI, 81-90) days. The estimated mean time to loss of a positive antibody result was 137 (95%CrI 127-148) days. We observed variation between individuals; higher maximum observed IgG titres were associated with longer estimated antibody half-lives. Increasing age, Asian ethnicity and prior self-reported symptoms were independently associated with higher maximum antibody levels, and increasing age and a positive PCR test undertaken for symptoms with longer antibody half-lives.\n\nConclusionIgG antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid wane within months, and faster in younger adults and those without symptoms. Ongoing longitudinal studies are required to track the long-term duration of antibody levels and their association with immunity to SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.\n\nSummarySerially measured SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid IgG titres from 452 seropositive healthcare workers demonstrate levels fall by half in 85 days. From a peak result, detectable antibodies last a mean 137 days. Levels fall faster in younger adults and following asymptomatic infection.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 pandemics sets the healthcare system to a shortage of ventilators. We aimed at assessing tidal volume (VT) delivery and air recirculation during expiration when one ventilator is divided into 2 patients. The study was performed in a research laboratory in a medical ICU of a University hospital. An ICU-dedicated (V500) and a lower-level ventilator (Elisee 350) were attached to two test-lungs (QuickLung) through a dedicated flow-splitter. A 50 mL/cmH2O Compliance (C) and 5 cmH2O/L/s Resistance (R) were set in both A and B lungs (step1), C50R20 in A / C20R20 in B (step 2), C20R20 in A / C10R20 in B (step 3), and C50R20 in A / C20R5 in B (step 4). Each ventilator was set in volume and pressure control mode to deliver 0.8L VT. We assessed VT from a pneumotachograph placed immediately before each lung, rebreathed volume, and expiratory resistance (circuit and valve). Values are median (1st-3rd quartiles) and compared between ventilators by non-parametric tests. Between Elisee 350 and V500 in volume control VT in A/B patients were 0.381/0.387 vs. 0.412/0.433L in step 1, 0.501/0.270 vs. 0.492/0.370L in step 2, 0.509/0.237 vs. 0.496/0.332L in step 3, and 0.496/0.281 vs. 0.480/0.329L in step 4. In pressure control the corresponding values were 0.373/0.336 vs. 0.430/0.414L, 0.416/0.185/0.322/0.234L, 0.193/0.108 vs. 0.176/0.092L and 0.422/0.201 vs. 0.481/0.329L, respectively (P<0.001 between ventilators at each step for each volume). Rebreathed air volume ranged between 0.7 to 37.8 ml and negatively correlated with expiratory resistance in steps 2 and 3. The lower-level ventilator performed closely to the ICU-dedicated ventilator. Due to dependence of VT to C pressure control should be used to maintain adequate VT at least in one patient when C and/or R changes abruptly and monitoring of VT should be done carefully. Increasing expiratory resistance should reduce rebreathed volume.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVascular thrombosis is common in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Etiologies underlying this complication are unclear.\n\nPurposeTo determine the prevalence of antiphospholipid (aPL), including lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin and anti-{beta}2-glycoprotein-1 antibodies, and its possible association with thrombotic manifestations of COVID-19.\n\nData SourcesWe searched MEDLINE indexed journals on September 24, 2020 using the tool LitCovid and the pre-print server medRxIV.\n\nStudy SelectionOriginal investigations (cross-sectional studies, cohort studies, case series, and research letters) on COVID-19 and thrombosis were included.\n\nData ExtractionData were independently extracted, and compiled into spreadsheets based on the PRISMA principles.\n\nData SynthesisHospitalized patients with COVID-19 showed a higher prevalence of lupus anticoagulant compared to non-COVID-19 patients. Temporally, lupus anticoagulant was generally positive early in the course of illness, whereas anti-cardiolipin and anti-{beta}2-glycoprotein-1 antibodies appeared to emerge later in the disease. Some patients who were aPL-negative at an early time-point after disease onset became aPL-positive at a later time-point. Lupus anticoagulant was independently associated with thrombosis in 60 COVID-19 patients in New York had who had 32 thrombotic events (8 arterial and 24 venous). In 88 patients in Wuhan, who had more than 20 each of arterial and venous thrombotic events, medium/high positivity for multiple aPL was significantly associated with arterial thrombosis. However, the association of aPL with thrombosis was not evident in reports that had an overall lower number of or predominantly venous thrombotic events. Analysis of pooled patients revealed that aPL were significantly more frequent in COVID-19 patients with stroke than stroke patients in the general population. Furthermore, injection of IgG aPL fractions from COVID-19 patients into mice accelerated venous thrombosis.\n\nLimitationLimited data and paucity of prospective studies.\n\nConclusionThe aPL are prevalent in patients with COVID-19 and their presence is associated with thrombosis. Importantly, these antibodies may be a key mechanism of thrombosis in COVID-19. Follow-up studies are required to understand the relationship between aPL and the spectrum of vascular thrombosis during and after infection with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nPrimary Funding SourceNone.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTransgender and non-binary people are disproportionately burdened by barriers to quality healthcare, mental health challenges, and economic hardship. This study examined the impact of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and subsequent control measures on gender-affirming care, mental health, and economic stability among transgender and non-binary people globally.\n\nMethodsWe collected global cross-sectional data from 964 transgender and non-binary adult users of the Hornet and Her apps from April to August 2020 to characterize changes in gender-affirming care, mental health, and economic stability as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted Poisson regression models to assess if access to gender-affirming care and ability to live according to ones gender were related to depressive symptoms, anxiety, and changes in suicidal ideation.\n\nResultsIndividuals resided in 76 countries, including Turkey (27.4%,n=264/964) and Thailand (20.6%,n=205). A majority were non-binary (66.8%,n=644) or transfeminine (29.4%,n=283). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 55.0% (n=320/582) reported reduced access to gender- affirming resources, and 38.0% (n=327/860) reported reduced time lived according to their gender. About half screened positive for depression (50.4%,442/877) and anxiety (45.8%,n=392/856). One in six (17.0%,n=112/659) expected losses of health insurance, and 77.0% (n=724/940) expected income reductions. The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and increased suicidal ideation were 1.63 (95% CI: 1.36-1.97), 1.61 (95% CI: 1.31-1.97), and 1.74 (95% CI: 1.07-2.82) times higher for individuals whose access to gender- affirming resources was reduced versus not.\n\nDiscussionThe COVID-19 pandemic has reduced access to gender-affirming resources and the ability of transgender and non-binary people to live according to their gender worldwide. These reductions may drive the increased depressive symptoms, anxiety, and suicidal ideation reported in this sample. To improve transgender and non-binary health globally, increased access to gender-affirming resources should be achieved through policies (e.g., digital prescriptions), flexible interventions (e.g., telehealth), and support for existing transgender health initiatives.",

    "abstract": "In a disease, where all infected persons show symptoms, it is reasonable to calculate mortality by case to fatality rate CFR. Deaths follow infections by a certain time lag. However, in the Covid-19 pandemic many infectious patients show no or hardly any symptoms. The reported infections and deaths do not run parallel, but diverge with the volume of tests.\n\nOur investigations for Germany, USA and UK indicate that deaths do not follow the number of infections, but the positive rate of tests, multiplied by a constant factor F and shifted by about two weeks. These test adjusted results of mortality allow for the estimation of the number of deaths of Covid-19 about two weeks ahead, even in a sharply rising state of the pandemic. This gives medical authorities two weeks of time to plan for resources.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesTo determine the impact of restrictions on mobility on reducing transmission of COVID-19.\n\nDesignDaily incidence rates lagged by 14 days were regressed on mobility changes using LOESS regression and logit regression between the day of the 100th case in each country to August 31, 2020.\n\nSetting34 OECD countries plus Singapore and Taiwan.\n\nParticipantsGoogle mobility data were obtained from people who turned on mobile device-based global positioning system (GPS) and agreed to share their anonymized position information with Google.\n\nInterventionsWe examined the association of COVID-19 incidence rates with mobility changes, defined as changes in categories of domestic location, against a pre-pandemic baseline, using country-specific daily incidence data on newly confirmed COVID-19 cases and mobility data.\n\nResultsIn two thirds of examined countries, reductions of up to 40% in commuting mobility (to workplaces, transit stations, retailers, and recreation) were associated with decreased COVID-19 incidence, more so early in the pandemic. However, these decreases plateaued as mobility remained low or decreased further. We found smaller or negligible associations between mobility restriction and incidence rates in the late phase in most countries.\n\nConclusionMild to moderate degrees of mobility restriction in most countries were associated with reduced incidence rates of COVID-19 that appear to attenuate over time, while some countries exhibited no effect of such restrictions. More detailed research is needed to precisely understand the benefits and limitations of mobility restrictions as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICSince SARS-CoV-2 became a pandemic, restrictions on mobility such as limitations on travel and closure of offices, restaurants, and shops have been imposed in an unprecedented way in both scale and scope to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the absence of effective treatment options or a vaccine. Although mobility restriction has also brought about tremendous costs such as negative economic growth and other collateral impacts on health such as increased morbidity and mortality from lack of access to other essential health services, little evidence exists on the effectiveness of mobility restriction for the prevention of disease transmission. A search of PUBMED and Google Scholar for publications on this topic through Sep 20, 2020 revealed that most of the evidence on the effectiveness of physical distancing comes from mathematical modeling studies using a variety of assumptions. One study investigated only the combined effect of several interventions, including physical distancing, among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.\n\nWHAT THIS STUDY ADDSThis is the first study to investigate the association between change in mobility and incidence of COVID-19 globally using real-time measures of mobility at the population level. For this, we used Google Global Mobility data and the daily incidence of COVID-19 for 36 countries from the day of 100th case detection through August 31, 2020. Our findings from LOESS regression show that in two-thirds of countries, reductions of up to 40% in commuting mobility were associated with decreased COVID-19 incidence, more so early in the pandemic. This decrease, however, plateaued as mobility decreased further. We found that associations between mobility restriction and incidence became smaller or negligible in the late phase of the pandemic in most countries. The reduced incidence rate of COVID-19 cases with a mild to moderate degree of mobility restriction in most countries suggests some value to limited mobility restriction in early phases of epidemic mitigation. The lack of impact in some others, however, suggests further research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the distinguishing factors for when mobility restrictions are helpful in decreasing viral transmission. Governments should carefully consider the level and period of mobility restriction necessary to achieve the desired benefits and minimize harm.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRemdesivir (RDV) is the only antiviral drug registered currently for treatment of COVID-19 after a few clinical trials with controversial results. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of RDV in patients with COVID-19 in real world settings.\n\nMethodsPatients were selected from 1496 individuals included in the SARSTer national database; 122 of them received therapy with RDV and 211 were treated with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-based therapy. The primary end-point of effectiveness was clinical improvement in the ordinal 8-point scale, which was defined as a 2-point decrease from baseline to 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of hospitalization. The secondary end-points of effectiveness included: death rate, rate of no clinical improvement within 28 days of hospitalization in the ordinal scale, rate of the need for constant oxygen therapy, duration of oxygen therapy, rate of the need for mechanical ventilation, total hospitalization time, and rate of positive RT PCR for SARS-CoV-2 after 30 days.\n\nFindingsSignificantly higher rates of clinical improvement, by 15% and 10% respectively, were observed after RDV treatment compared to LPV/r at days 21 and 28. The difference between regimens increased with worsening of oxygen saturation (SpO2) and depending on the baseline score from the ordinal scale. Statistically significant differences supporting RDV were also noted regarding the rate of no clinical improvement within 28 days of hospitalization and hospitalization duration in patients with baseline SpO2 [&le;]90%. In the logistic regression model only the administration of remdesivir was independently associated with at least a 2-point improvement in the ordinal scale between baseline and day 21.\n\nInterpretationIn conclusion, data collected in this retrospective, observational, real world study supported use of remdesivir for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection particularly in patients with oxygen saturation [&le;]95%.",

    "abstract": "The ambient conditions surrounding liquid droplets determine their growth or shrinkage. However, the precise fate of a liquid droplet expelled from a respiratory puff as dictated by its surroundings and the puff itself has not yet been fully quantified. From the view of airborne disease transmission, such as SARS-CoV-2, knowledge of such dependencies are critical. Here we employ direct numerical simulations (DNS) of a turbulent respiratory vapour puff and account for the mass and temperature exchange with respiratory droplets and aerosols. In particular, we investigate how droplets respond to different ambient temperatures and relative humidity (RH) by tracking their Lagrangian statistics. We reveal and quantify that in cold and humid environments, as there the respiratory puff is supersaturated, expelled droplets can first experience significant growth, and only later followed by shrinkage, in contrast to the monotonic shrinkage of droplets as expected from the classical view by William F. Wells (1934). Indeed, cold and humid environments diminish the ability of air to hold water vapour, thus causing the respiratory vapour puff to super-saturate. Consequently, the super-saturated vapour field drives the growth of droplets that are caught and transported within the humid puff. To analytically predict the likelihood for droplet growth, we propose a model for the axial RH based on the assumption of a quasi-stationary jet. Our model correctly predicts super-saturated RH conditions and is in good quantitative agreement with our DNS. Our results culminate in a temperature-RH map that can be employed as an indicator for droplet growth or shrinkage.\n\nSignificance StatementInfluence of environmental conditions on airborne diseases transmission is an important issue, especially during the pandemic of COVID-19. Human-to-human transmission is mediated by the transport of virus-laden respiratory droplets. Here we investigate the problem from a fluid mechanics perspective by conducting numerical simulations to quantify the fate of respiratory droplets in a warm humid coughing puff under different ambient conditions. We reveal a non-intuitive regime with considerable growth of respiratory droplets, dominated by a super-saturated vapour field, preferentially occurring in cold and humid environments. We further propose a theoretical model that accurately predicts the condition for droplet growth. Our work should inform socializing policies and ventilation strategies for controlling indoor ambient conditions to mitigate dispersion of droplets from asymptomatic individuals.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundQuantifying occupational risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers can inform efforts to improve healthcare worker and patient safety and reduce transmission. This study aimed to quantify demographic, occupational, and community risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among healthcare workers in a large metropolitan healthcare system.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed data from a cross-sectional survey conducted from April through June of 2020 linking risk factors for occupational and community exposure to COVID-19 with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. A multivariable logistic regression model was fit to quantify risk factors for infection. Participants were employees and medical staff members who elected to participate in SARS-CoV-2 serology testing offered to all healthcare workers as part of a quality initiative, and who completed a survey on exposure to COVID-19 and use of personal protective equipment. Exposures of interest included known demographic risk factors for COVID-19, residential zip code incidence of COVID-19, occupational exposure to PCR test-positive healthcare workers or patients, and use of personal protective equipment. The primary outcome of interest was SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity.\n\nResultsSARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was estimated to be 5.7% (95% CI: 5.2%-6.1%) among 10,275 healthcare workers. Community contact with a person known or suspected to have COVID-19 (aOR=1.9, 95% CI:1.4-2.5) and zip code level COVID-19 incidence (aOR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0-2.0) increased the odds of infection. Black individuals were at high risk (aOR=2.0, 95% CI:1.6-2.4). Overall, occupational risk factors accounted for 27% (95% CI: 25%-30%) of the risk among healthcare workers and included contact with a PCR test-positive healthcare worker (aOR=1.2, 95% CI:1.0-1.6).\n\nConclusionsCommunity risk factors, including contact with a COVID-19 positive individual and residential COVID-19 incidence, are more strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among healthcare workers than exposure in the workplace.",

    "abstract": "Rapid tests to evaluate SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses are urgently needed to decipher protective immunity and aid monitoring vaccine-induced immunity. Using a rapid whole blood assay requiring minimal amount of blood, we measured qualitatively and quantitatively SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell responses in 31 healthcare workers, using flow cytometry. 100% of COVID-19 convalescent participants displayed a detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell response. SARS-CoV-2-responding cells were also detected in 40.9% of participants with no COVID-19-associated symptoms or who tested PCR negative. Phenotypic assessment indicated that, in COVID-19 convalescent participants, SARS-CoV-2 CD4 responses displayed an early differentiated memory phenotype with limited capacity to produce IFN{gamma}. Conversely, in participants with no reported symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 CD4 responses were enriched in late differentiated cells, co-expressing IFN{gamma} and TNF and also Granzyme B. This proof of concept study presents a scalable alternative to PBMC-based assays to enumerate and phenotype SARS-CoV-2-responding T cells, thus representing a practical tool to monitor adaptive immunity in vaccine trials.\n\nSummaryIn this proof of concept study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses are easily detectable using a rapid whole blood assay requiring minimal blood volume. Such assay could represent a suitable tool to monitor adaptive immunity in vaccine trials.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare professionals (HCPs) are at the frontline in the fight against COVID-19 and are at an increased risk of becoming infected with coronavirus. Risk of infection can be minimized by use of proper personal protective equipment (PPE). This study assessed the availability of PPE and satisfaction of HCPs in six public hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted from 9th to 26th June 2020. The study hospitals included: Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Zewditu Memorial Hospital, Ghandi Memorial Hospital, Menelik II Hospital, Yekatit 12 Hospital Medical College and St. Paul Hospital Millennium Medical College. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the data and Chi-square test was used to assess the association between the groups. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with the satisfaction level of healthcare workers with regard to the availability and use of proper PPE during the current COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1,134 (92.3%) valid questionnaires from a possible 1,228 were included in the analysis. The mean ({+/-}SD) age of the participants was 30.26{+/-}6.43 year and 52.6% were females. Nurses constituted about 40% of the overall sample, followed by physicians (22.2%), interns (10.8%), midwives (10.3%) and others (16.7%). An overall shortage of PPE was reported in all study hospitals. The majority (77%) of the healthcare professionals reported that their hospital did not have adequate PPE. A critical shortage of N95 respirator was particularly reported, the self-reported availability of N95 increased from 13% to 24% before and during COVID-19, respectively. The self-reported use of N95 increased from 9% to 21% before and during COVID-19, respectively. Almost 72% of the respondents were dissatisfied with the availability of PPE in their hospital. The independent predictors of the respondents satisfaction level about PPE were male gender (adjusted OR=1.39, 95% CI:1.05-1.85), healthcare workers who reported that PPE was adequately available in the hospital (adjusted OR=7.53, 95% CI:5.08-11.16), and preparedness to provide care to COVID-19 cases (adjusted OR=1.65, 95% CI:1.22-2.12). A critical shortage of appropriate PPE both before and during COVID-19 was identified. The high level of dissatisfaction with the availability of PPE might potentially lead to a lower level of preparedness and readiness to fight against COVID-19. Therefore, urgent efforts are needed to adequately supply the healthcare facilities with appropriate PPE to alleviate the challenges.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare professionals are at higher risk of contracting the novel coronavirus due to their work exposure in the healthcare settings. Practicing appropriate preventive measures to control COVID-19 infection is one of the most important interventions that healthcare workers are expected to use. The aim of this study was to assess the level of risk perception and practices of preventive measures of COVID-19 among health workers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 9th to 26th June 2020 among healthcare professionals working at six public hospitals in Addis Ababa. Data were collected using a self-administered structured questionnaire. Frequency, percentage, and mean were used to summarize the data. A binary logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with risk perception about COVID-19. A total of 1,134 participants were surveyed. Wearing facemask (93%), hand washing for at least 20 seconds (93%), covering mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing (91%), and avoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth (91%) were the commonly self-reported preventive practices. About 88% perceived that they were worried about the risk of becoming infected with coronavirus, and majority (91%) worried about the risk of infection to their family. The mean score of overall fear and worry of COVID-19 was 2.37 on a scale of 1 to 3. Respondents who ever provided clinical care to COVID-19 patients were more likely to report fear and worry (adjusted OR=1.34, 95% CI:1.02-1.91), however those who ever participated in Ebola or SARS outbreaks were less likely to report fear and worry due to COVID-19 crisis (adjusted OR=0.66, 95% CI:0.48-0.90). This study has revealed widespread practices of preventive measures and the highest perceived risk of COVID-19 among healthcare workers. Therefore, an effective risk communication intervention should be implemented to ensure the maintenance of appropriate practices during the current COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, gay and other men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States (US) report similar or fewer sexual partners and reduced HIV testing and care access. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use has declined. We estimated the potential impact of COVID-19 on HIV incidence and mortality among US MSM.\n\nMethodsWe used a calibrated HIV transmission model for MSM in Baltimore, Maryland, and available data on COVID-19-related disruptions to predict impacts of data-driven reductions in sexual partners(0%,25%,50%), condom use(5%), HIV testing(20%), viral suppression(10%), PrEP initiations(72%), PrEP use(9%) and ART initiations(50%), exploring different disruption durations and magnitudes. We estimated the median (95% credible interval) change in cumulative new HIV infections and deaths among MSM over one and five years, compared with a scenario without COVID-19-related disruptions.\n\nFindingsA six-month 25% reduction in sexual partners among Baltimore MSM, without HIV service changes, could reduce new HIV infections by 12{middle dot}2%(11{middle dot}7,12{middle dot}8%) and 3{middle dot}0%(2{middle dot}6,3{middle dot}4%) over one and five years, respectively. In the absence of changes in sexual behaviour, the six-month data-driven disruptions to condom use, testing, viral suppression, PrEP initiations, PrEP use and ART initiations combined were predicted to increase new HIV infections by 10{middle dot}5%(5{middle dot}8,16{middle dot}5%) over one year, and by 3{middle dot}5%(2{middle dot}1,5{middle dot}4%) over five years. A 25% reduction in partnerships offsets the negative impact of these combined service disruptions on new HIV infections (overall reduction 3{middle dot}9%(-1{middle dot}0,7{middle dot}4%), 0{middle dot}0%(-1{middle dot}4,0{middle dot}9%) over one, five years, respectively), but not on HIV deaths (corresponding increases 11{middle dot}0%(6{middle dot}2,17{middle dot}7%), 2{middle dot}6%(1{middle dot}5,4{middle dot}3%)). The predicted impacts of reductions in partnerships or viral suppression doubled if they lasted 12 months or if disruptions were twice as large.\n\nInterpretationMaintaining access to ART and adherence support is of the utmost importance to minimise excess HIV-related mortality due to COVID-19 restrictions in the US, even if accompanied by reductions in sexual partnerships.\n\nFundingNIH\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe COVID-19 pandemic and responses to it have disrupted HIV prevention and treatment services and led to changes in sexual risk behaviour in the United States, but the overall potential impact on HIV transmission and HIV-related mortality is not known. We searched PubMed for articles documenting COVID-related disruptions to HIV prevention and treatment and changes in sexual risk behaviour in the United States, published between 1st January and 7th October 2020, with no language restrictions, using the terms COVID* AND (HIV OR AIDS) AND (\"United States\" OR US). We identified three cross-sectional surveys assessing changes in sexual risk behaviour among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States, one finding a reduction, one a slight increase, and one no change in partner numbers during COVID-19 restrictions. Two of these studies also found reductions in reported HIV testing, HIV care and/or access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among MSM due to COVID-19. A separate study from a San Francisco clinic found declines in viral suppression among its clients during lockdown. We searched PubMed for articles estimating the impact of COVID-related disruptions on HIV transmission and mortality published between 1st January 2020 and 12th October 2020, with no language restrictions, using the following terms: COVID* AND model* AND (HIV OR AIDS). We identified two published studies which had used mathematical modelling to estimate the impact of hypothetical COVID-19-related disruptions to HIV programmes on HIV-related deaths and/or new HIV infections in Africa, another published study using modelling to estimate the impact of COVID-19-related disruptions and linked HIV and SARS-CoV-2 testing on new HIV infections in six cities in the United States, and a pre-print reporting modelling of the impact of COVID-19-related disruptions on HIV incidence among men who have sex with men in Atlanta, United States. None of these studies were informed by data on the size of these disruptions. The two African studies and the Atlanta study assessed the impact of disruptions to different healthcare disruptions separately, and all found that the greatest negative impacts on new HIV infections and/or deaths would arise from interruptions to antiretroviral therapy. They all found smaller effects on HIV-related mortality and/or incidence from other healthcare disruptions, including HIV testing, PrEP use and condom supplies. The United States study assessing the impact of linked HIV and SARS-CoV-2 testing estimated that this could substantially reduce HIV incidence.\n\nAdded value of this studyWe used mathematical modelling to derive estimates of the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions on HIV incidence and mortality among MSM in the United States, directly informed by data from the United States on disruptions to HIV testing, antiretroviral therapy and pre-exposure prophylaxis services and reported changes in sexual risk behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also assessed the impact of an HIV testing campaign during COVID-19 lockdown.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceIn the United States, maintaining access to antiretroviral therapy and adherence support for both existing and new users will be crucial to minimize excess HIV-related deaths arising from the COVID-19 pandemic among men who have sex with men. While reductions in sexual risk behaviour may offset increases in new HIV infections arising from disruptions to HIV prevention and treatment services, this will not offset the additional HIV-related deaths which are also predicted to occur. There are mixed findings on the impact of an HIV testing campaign among US MSM during COVID-19 lockdown. Together, these studies highlight the importance of maintaining effective HIV treatment provision during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Classification and early detection of severe COVID-19 patients is urgently required to establish an effective treatment. Here, we tested the utility of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to classify and predict the severity of COVID-19 in a clinical setting. We used this technology to analyse the mass spectra profiles of the sera from 80 COVID-19 patients, clinically classified as mild (33), severe (26) and critical (21), and 20 healthy controls. We found a clear variability of the serum peptidome profile depending on COVID-19 severity. Seventy-eight peaks were significantly different and 12 at least four fold more intense in the set of critical patients than in the mild ones. Analysis of the resulting matrix of peak intensities by machine learning approaches classified severe (severe and critical) and non-severe (mild) patients with a 90% of accuracy. Furthermore, machine learning predicted correctly the favourable outcome of the severe patients in 85% of the cases and the unfavourable in 38% of the cases. Finally, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis of sera identified five proteins that were significantly upregulated in the critical patients. They included serum amyloid proteins A1 and A2, which probably yielded the most intense peaks with m/z 11,530 and 11,686 detected by MALDI-TOF MS.\n\nIn summary, we demonstrated the potential of the MALDI-TOF MS as a bench to bedside technology to aid clinicians in their decisions to classify COVID-19 patients and predict their evolution.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIvermectin is one among several potential drugs explored for its therapeutic and preventive role in COVID-19 infection. The study was aimed to explore the association between ivermectin prophylaxis and development of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers.\n\nMethodsA hospital-based matched case-control study was conducted among healthcare workers of AIIMS Bhubaneswar, India, from September to October 2020. Profession, gender, age and date of diagnosis were matched for 186 case-control pairs. Cases and controls were healthcare workers who tested positive and negative, respectively, for COVID-19 by RT-PCR. Exposure was defined as the intake of ivermectin and/or hydroxychloroquine and/or vitamin-C and/or other prophylaxis for COVID-19. Data collection and entry was done in Epicollect5, and analysis was performed using STATA version 13. Conditional logistic regression models were used to describe the associated factors for COVID-19 infection.\n\nResultsIvermectin prophylaxis was taken by 77 controls and 38 cases. Two-dose ivermectin prophylaxis (0.27, 95% CI, 0.15-0.51) was associated with 73% reduction of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers for the following one month, those who were involved in physical activity (3.06 95% CI, 1.18-7.93) for more than an hour/day were more likely to contract COVID-19 infection. Type of household, COVID duty, single-dose ivermectin prophylaxis, vitamin-C prophylaxis and hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis were not associated with COVID-19 infection.\n\nConclusionTwo-dose ivermectin prophylaxis at a dose of 300 g/kg with a gap of 72 hours was associated 73% reduction of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers for the following one-month. Further research is required before its large scale use.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a pathogen of immense public health concern. Efforts to control the disease have only proven mildly successful, and the disease will likely continue to cause excessive fatalities until effective preventative measures (such as a vaccine) are developed. To develop disease management strategies, a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and population susceptibility to infection are needed. To this end, physiologically-relevant mathematical modeling can provide a robust in silico tool to understand COVID-19 pathophysiology and the in vivo dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Guided by ACE2-tropism (ACE2 receptor dependency for infection) of the virus, and by incorporating cellular-scale viral dynamics and innate and adaptive immune responses, we have developed a multiscale mechanistic model for simulating the time-dependent evolution of viral load distribution in susceptible organs of the body (respiratory tract, gut, liver, spleen, heart, kidneys, and brain). Following calibration with in vivo and clinical data, we used the model to simulate viral load progression in a virtual patient with varying degrees of compromised immune status. Further, we conducted global sensitivity analysis of model parameters and ranked them for their significance in governing clearance of viral load to understand the effects of physiological factors and underlying conditions on viral load dynamics. Antiviral drug therapy, interferon therapy, and their combination was simulated to study the effects on viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2. The model revealed the dominant role of innate immunity (specifically interferons and resident macrophages) in controlling viral load, and the importance of timing when initiating therapy following infection.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=118 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/20215335v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@60d1dforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@728ed8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10043a8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@59f944_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundREACT-1 measures prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in representative samples of the population in England using PCR testing from self-administered nose and throat swabs. Here we report interim results for round 6 of observations for swabs collected from the 16th to 25th October 2020 inclusive.\n\nMethodsREACT-1 round 6 aims to collect data and swab results from 160,000 people aged 5 and above. Here we report results from the first 86,000 individuals. We estimate prevalence of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, reproduction numbers (R) and temporal trends using exponential growth or decay models. Prevalence estimates are presented both unweighted and weighted to be representative of the population of England, accounting for response rate, region, deprivation and ethnicity. We compare these interim results with data from round 5, based on swabs collected from 18th September to 5th October 2020 inclusive.\n\nResultsOverall prevalence of infection in the community in England was 1.28% or 128 people per 10,000, up from 60 per 10,000 in the previous round. Infections were doubling every 9.0 (6.1, 18) days with a national reproduction number (R) estimated at 1.56 (1.27, 1.88) compared to 1.16 (1.05, 1.27) in the previous round. Prevalence of infection was highest in Yorkshire and The Humber at 2.72% (2.12%, 3.50%), up from 0.84% (0.60%, 1.17%), and the North West at 2.27% (1.90%, 2.72%), up from 1.21% (1.01%, 1.46%), and lowest in South East at 0.55% (0.45%, 0.68%), up from 0.29% (0.23%, 0.37%). Clustering of cases was more prevalent in Lancashire, Manchester, Liverpool and West Yorkshire, West Midlands and East Midlands. Interim estimates of R were above 2 in the South East, East of England, London and South West, but with wide confidence intervals. Nationally, prevalence increased across all age groups with the greatest increase in those aged 55-64 at 1.20% (0.99%, 1.46%), up 3-fold from 0.37% (0.30%, 0.46%). In those aged over 65, prevalence was 0.81% (0.58%, 0.96%) up 2-fold from 0.35% (0.28%, 0.43%). Prevalence remained highest in 18 to 24-year olds at 2.25% (1.47%, 3.42%).\n\nConclusionThe co-occurrence of high prevalence and rapid growth means that the second wave of the epidemic in England has now reached a critical stage. Whether via regional or national measures, it is now time-critical to control the virus and turn R below one if further hospital admissions and deaths from COVID-19 are to be avoided.",

    "abstract": "In this work we propose a delay differential equation as a lumped parameter or compartmental infectious disease model featuring high descriptive and predictive capability, extremely high adaptability and low computational requirement. Whereas the model has been developed in the context of COVID-19, it is general enough to be applicable mutatis mutandis to other diseases as well. Our fundamental modeling philosophy consists of a decoupling of public health intervention effects, immune response effects and intrinsic infection properties into separate terms. All parameters in the model are directly related to the disease and its management; we can measure or calculate their values a priori basis our knowledge of the phenomena involved, instead of having to extrapolate them from solution curves. Our model can accurately predict the effects of applying or withdrawing interventions, individually or in combination, and can quickly accommodate any newly released information regarding, for example, the infection properties and the immune response to an emerging infectious disease. After demonstrating that the baseline model can successfully explain the COVID-19 case trajectories observed all over the world, we systematically show how the model can be expanded to account for heterogeneous transmissibility, detailed contact tracing drives, mass testing endeavours and immune responses featuring different combinations of limited-time sterilizing immunity, severity-reducing immunity and antibody dependent enhancement.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 has highlighted social and health injustices in the US. Structural inequalities have increased the likelihood of immigrants contracting COVID-19, by being essential workers and through poverty that forces this population to continue working. Rural and urban immigrant families may face different concerns. Using a telephone survey in May 2020 of 105 Latinx families in an existing study, quantitative and qualitative data were gathered on work and household economics, childcare and education, healthcare, and community climate. Analyses show that, although rural and urban groups experienced substantial economic effects, impacts were more acute for urban families. Rural workers reported fewer workplace protective measures for COVID-19. For both groups, fear and worry, particularly about finances and children, dominated reports of their situations with numerous reports of experiencing stress and anxiety. The experience of the pandemic is interpreted as an example of contextual vulnerability of a population already experiencing structural violence through social injustice.",

    "abstract": "Despite the growing knowledge of T cell responses and their epitopes in COVID-19 patients, there is a lack of detailed characterizations for T cell-antigen interactions and T cell functions. Using a peptide library predicted with HLA class I-restriction, specific CD8+ T cell responses were identified in over 75% of COVID-19 convalescent patients. Among the 15 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes identified from the S and N proteins, N361-369 (KTFPPTEPK) was the most dominant epitope. Importantly, we discovered 2 N361-369-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) with high functional avidity, and they exhibited complementary cross-reactivity to reported N361-369 mutant variants. In dendritic cells (DCs) and the lung organoid model, we found that the N361-369 epitope could be processed and endogenously presented to elicit the activation and cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells ex vivo. Our study evidenced potential mechanisms of cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2, illuminating natural ways of viral clearance with high relevancy in the vaccine development.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, resulting in economic losses and seriously threating the human health in worldwide, highlighting the urgent need of a stabilized, easily produced and effective preventive vaccine. The SARS-COV-2 spike protein receptor binding region (RBD) plays an important role in the process of viral binding receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and membrane fusion, making it an ideal target for vaccine development. In this study, we designed three different RBD-conjugated nanoparticles vaccine candidates, RBD-Ferritin (24-mer), RBD-mi3 (60-mer) and RBD-I53-50 (120-mer), with the application of covalent bond linking by SpyTag-SpyCatcher system. It was demonstrated that the neutralizing capability of sera from mice immunized with three RBD-conjugated nanoparticles adjuvanted with AddaVax or Sigma Systerm Adjuvant (SAS) after each immunization was ~8-to 120-fold greater than monomeric RBD group in SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and authentic virus neutralization assay. Most importantly, sera from RBD-conjugated NPs groups more efficiently blocked the binding of RBD to ACE2 or neutralizing antibody in vitro, a further proof of promising immunization effect. Besides, high physical stability and flexibility in assembly consolidated the benefit for rapid scale-up production of vaccine. These results supported that our designed SARS-CoV-2 RBD-conjugated nanoparticle was competitive vaccine candidate and the carrier nanoparticles could be adopted as universal platform for future vaccine development.",

The continual emergence of novel coronaviruses underscores the importance of developing effective vaccines as well as novel therapeutic options that target either viral functions or host factors recruited to support coronavirus replication. The CoV nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) has been shown to promote cellular mRNA degradation, block host cell translation, and inhibit the innate immune response to virus infection. Interestingly, deletion of the nsp1-coding region in infectious clones prevented the virus from productively infecting cultured cells. Because of nsp1s importance in the CoV lifecycle, it has been highlighted as a viable target for both antiviral therapy and vaccine development. However, the fundamental molecular and structural mechanisms that underlie nsp1 function remain poorly understood, despite its critical role in the viral lifecycle. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of the amino, globular portion of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 (residues 10 - 127) at 1.77[A] resolution. A comparison of our structure with the SARS-CoV-1 nsp1 structure reveals how mutations alter the conformation of flexible loops, inducing the formation of novel secondary structural elements and new surface features. Paired with the recently published structure of the carboxyl end of nsp1 (residues 148 - 180), our results provide the groundwork for future studies focusing on SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 structure and function during the viral lifecycle.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent for the COVID-19 pandemic. One protein known to play a critical role in the coronavirus lifecycle is nonstructural protein1 (nsp1). As such, it has been highlighted in numerous studies as a target for both the development of antivirals and for the design of live-attenuated vaccines. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of nsp1 derived from SARS-CoV-2 at 1.77[A] resolution. This structure will facilitate future studies focusing on understanding the relationship between structure and function for nsp1. In turn, understanding these structure-function relationships will allow nsp1 to be fully exploited as a target for both antiviral development and vaccine design.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory viruses initially infect the naso- and oropharyngeal regions, where they amplify, cause symptoms and may also be transmitted to new hosts. Preventing initial infection or reducing viral loads upon infection might soothe symptoms, prevent dissemination into the lower airways, or transmission to the next individual. We here analyzed the potential of plant derived products to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus. We found that black chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa) juice, pomegranate (Punica granatum) juice, and green tea (Camellia sinensis) have virucidal activity against both viruses, suggesting that oral rinsing may reduce viral loads in the oral cavity thereby lowering virus transmission.",

    "abstract": "Data on potential effectiveness and prospects of treatment of new coronavirus infection of COVID-19 caused by virus SARS-CoV-2 with the help of antisense oligonucleotides acting against RNA of virus on an in vitro model are given. The ability of antisense oligonucleotides to suppress viral replication in diseases caused by coronaviruses using the example of SARS and MERS is shown. The identity of the initial regulatory section of RNA of various coronaviruses was found within 50 - 100 nucleotides from the 5-end, which allows using antisense suppression of this RNA fragment. A new RNA fragment of the virus present in all samples of coronovirus SARS-CoV-2 has been identified, the suppression of which with the help of an antisense oligonucleotide can be effective in the treatment of COVID-19. The study of the synthesized antisense oligonucleotide 5 - AGCCGAGTGACAGCC ACACAG, complementary to the selected virus RNA sequence, was carried out. The low toxicity of the preparations of this group in the cell culture study and the ability to reduce viral load at high doses according to real time-PCR data are shown. The cytopathogenic dose exceeds 2 mg / ml. At a dosage of 1 mg / ml, viral replication is reduced by 5-13 times. Conclusions are made about the prospects of this direction and the feasibility of using the inhalation way of drug administration into the body.",

    "abstract": "Recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic risk factors for developing severe COVID-19 symptoms. The studies reported a 1bp insertion rs11385942 on chromosome 31 and furthermore two single nucleotide variants (SNVs) rs35044562 and rs679599192, all three correlated with each other. Zeberg and Paabo3 subsequently traced them back to Neanderthal origin. They found that a 49.4 kb genomic region including the risk allele of rs35044562 is inherited from Neanderthals of Vindija in Croatia. Here we add a differently focused evaluation of this major genetic risk factor to these recent analyses. We show that (i) COVID-19-related genetic factors of Neanderthals deviate from those of modern humans and that (ii) they differ among world-wide human populations, which compromises risk prediction in non-Europeans. Currently, caution is thus advised in the genetic risk assessment of non-Europeans during this world-wide COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Having claimed over 1 million lives worldwide to date, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created one of the biggest challenges to develop an effective drug to treat infected patients. Among all the proteins expressed by the virus, RNA helicase is a fundamental protein for viral replication, and it is highly conserved among the coronaviridae family. To date, there is no high-resolution structure of helicase bound with ATP and RNA. We present here structural insights and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation results of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA helicase both in its apo form and in complex with its natural substrates. Our structural information of the catalytically competent helicase complex provides valuable insights for the mechanism and function of this enzyme at the atomic level, a key to develop specific inhibitors for this potential COVID-19 drug target.",

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, there has been a continued research on the role of small non-coding RNAs including microRNAs (miRNAs) in various diseases. Studies have shown that viruses modulate the host cellular machinery and hijack its metabolic and immune signalling pathways by miRNA mediated gene silencing. Given the immensity of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic and the strong association of viral encoded miRNAs with their pathogenesis, it is important to study Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) miRNAs. To address this unexplored area, we identified 8 putative novel miRNAs from SARS-CoV-2 genome and explored their possible human gene targets. A significant proportion of these targets populated key immune and metabolic pathways such as MAPK signalling pathway, maturity-onset diabetes, Insulin signalling pathway, endocytosis, RNA transport, TGF-{beta} signalling pathway, to name a few. The data from this work is backed up by recently reported high-throughput transcriptomics datasets obtains from SARS-CoV-2 infected samples. Analysis of these datasets reveal that a significant proportion of the target human genes were down-regulated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. The current study brings to light probable host metabolic and immune pathways susceptible to viral miRNA mediated silencing in a SARS-CoV-2 infection, and discusses its effects on the host pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundClose contact with children may provide cross-reactive immunity to SARs-CoV-2 due to more frequent prior coryzal infections from seasonal coronaviruses. Alternatively, close contact with children may increase risk of SARs-CoV-2 infection. We investigated whether risk of infection with SARs-CoV-2 and severe outcomes differed between adults living with and without children.\n\nMethodsWorking on behalf of NHS England, we conducted a population-based cohort study using primary care data and pseudonymously-linked hospital and intensive care admissions, and death records, from patients registered in general practices representing 40% of England. Using multivariable Cox regression, we calculated fully-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of outcomes from 1st February-3rd August 2020 comparing adults living with and without children in the household.\n\nFindingsAmong 9,157,814 adults [&le;]65 years, living with children 0-11 years was not associated with increased risks of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 related hospital or ICU admission but was associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 death (HR 0.75, 95%CI 0.62-0.92). Living with children aged 12-18 years was associated with a small increased risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection (HR 1.08, 95%CI 1.03-1.13), but not associated with other COVID-19 outcomes. Living with children of any age was also associated with lower risk of dying from non-COVID-19 causes. Among 2,567,671 adults >65 years there was no association between living with children and outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2. We observed no consistent changes in risk following school closure.\n\nInterpretationFor adults living with children there is no evidence of an increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. These findings have implications for determining the benefit-harm balance of children attending school in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFundingThis work was supported by the Medical Research Council MR/V015737/1.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched MEDLINE on 19th October 2020 for population-based epidemiological studies comparing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease in people living with and without children. We searched for articles published in 2020, with abstracts available, and terms \"(children or parents or dependants) AND (COVID or SARS-CoV-2 or coronavirus) AND (rate or hazard or odds or risk), in the title, abstract or keywords. 244 papers were identified for screening but none were relevant. One additional study in preprint was identified on medRxiv and found a reduced risk of hospitalisation for COVID-19 and a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection among adult healthcare workers living with children.\n\nAdded value of this studyThis is the first population-based study to investigate whether the risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes from COVID-19 differ between adults living in households with and without school-aged children during the UK pandemic. Our findings show that for adults living with children there is no evidence of an increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes although there may be a slightly increased risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection for working-age adults living with children aged 12 to 18 years. Working-age adults living with children 0 to 11 years have a lower risk of death from COVID-19 compared to adults living without children, with the effect size being comparable to their lower risk of death from any cause. We observed no consistent changes in risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes from COVID-19 comparing periods before and after school closure.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceOur results demonstrate no evidence of serious harms from COVID-19 to adults in close contact with children, compared to those living in households without children. This has implications for determining the benefit-harm balance of children attending school in the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is critical in both controlling primary infection and preventing re-infection. However, there is concern that immune responses following natural infection may not be sustained and that this may predispose to recurrent infection. We analysed the magnitude and phenotype of the SARS-CoV-2 cellular immune response in 100 donors at six months following primary infection and related this to the profile of antibody level against spike, nucleoprotein and RBD over the previous six months. T-cell immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 were present by ELISPOT and/or ICS analysis in all donors and are characterised by predominant CD4+ T cell responses with strong IL-2 cytokine expression. Median T-cell responses were 50% higher in donors who had experienced an initial symptomatic infection indicating that the severity of primary infection establishes a  setpoint for cellular immunity that lasts for at least 6 months. The T-cell responses to both spike and nucleoprotein/membrane proteins were strongly correlated with the peak antibody level against each protein. The rate of decline in antibody level varied between individuals and higher levels of nucleoprotein-specific T cells were associated with preservation of NP-specific antibody level although no such correlation was observed in relation to spike-specific responses. In conclusion, our data are reassuring that functional SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses are retained at six months following infection although the magnitude of this response is related to the clinical features of primary infection.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV2 is a single strand RNA virus member of the type 2 coronavirus family, responsible for causing COVID-19 disease in humans. The objective of this study was to test the ivermectin drug in a murine model of coronavirus infection using a type 2 family RNA coronavirus similar to SARS-CoV2, the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). BALB/cJ female mice were infected with 6,000 PFU of MHV-A59 (Group Infected; n=20) and immediately treated with one single dose of 500 g/kg of ivermectin (Group Infected + IVM; n=20), or were not infected and treated with PBS (Control group; n=16). Five days after infection/treatment, mice were euthanized to obtain different tissues to check general health status and infection levels. Overall results demonstrated that viral infection induces the typical MHV disease in infected animals, with livers showing severe hepatocellular necrosis surrounded by a severe lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltration associated with a high hepatic viral load (52,158 AU), while ivermectin administration showed a better health status with lower viral load (23,192 AU; p<0.05) and few livers with histopathological damage (p<0.05), not showing statistical differences with control mice (P=NS). Furthermore, serum transaminase levels (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) were significantly lower in treated mice compared to infected animals. In conclusion, ivermectin seems to be effective to diminish MHV viral load and disease in mice, being a useful model for further understanding new therapies against coronavirus diseases.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and enforced significant restrictions within our societies, including the attendance of the public and professional athletes in gyms. Liquid chalk is a commonly used accessories in gyms and is comprised of magnesium carbonate and alcohol that quickly evaporates on the hands to leave a layer of dry chalk. We investigated whether liquid chalk is an antiseptic against highly pathogenic human viruses including, SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus and noroviruses. Chalk was applied before or after virus inoculum and recovery of infectious virus was determined to mimic the use in the gym. We observed that addition of chalk before or after virus contact lead to a significant reduction on recovery of infectious SARS-CoV-2 and influenza but had little impact on norovirus. These observations suggest that the use and application of liquid chalk can be an effective and suitable antiseptic for major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games.",

    "abstract": "Massive unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic could result in an eviction crisis in US cities. Here we model the effect of evictions on SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, simulating viral transmission within and among households in a theoretical metropolitan area. We recreate a range of urban epidemic trajectories and project the course of the epidemic under two counterfactual scenarios, one in which a strict moratorium on evictions is in place and enforced, and another in which evictions are allowed to resume at baseline or increased rates. We find, across scenarios, that evictions lead to significant increase in infections. Applying our model to Philadelphia using locally-specific parameters shows that the increase is especially profound in models that consider realistically heterogenous cities in which both evictions and contacts occur more frequently in poorer neighborhoods. Our results provide a basis to assess municipal eviction moratoriums and show that policies to stem evictions are a warranted and important component of COVID-19 control.",

    "abstract": "The rapid worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection has propelled the rapid development of serological tests that can detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. These have been used for studying the prevalence and spread of infection in different populations, helping establish a diagnosis of COVID-19, and will likely be used to confirm humoral immunity after infection or vaccination. However, nearly all lab-based high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 serological assays require a serum sample from venous blood draw, limiting their applications and scalability. Here, we present a method that enables large scale SARS-CoV-2 serological studies by combining self or office collection of fingerprick blood with an FDA-approved dried blood spot collection device (Neoteryx Mitra(R)) with a high-throughput electrochemiluminescence-based SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay (Roche Elecsys(R)) that is EUA approved for use on serum samples and widely used by clinical laboratories around the world. We found that the Roche Elecsys(R) assay has a high dynamic range that allows for accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum samples diluted 1:20 as well as contrived dried blood extracts. Extracts of dried blood from Neoteryx Mitra(R) devices acquired in a community seroprevalence study showed near identical sensitivity and specificity in detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as compared to neat sera using predefined thresholds for each specimen type. Overall, this study affirms the use of Neoteryx Mitra(R) dried blood collection device with the Roche Elecsys(R) SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay for remote or at-home testing as well as large-scale community seroprevalence studies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere is currently no evidence suggesting that COVID-19 takes a different course in HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral treatment compared to the general population. However, little is known about the relation between specific HIV-related factors and the severity of the COVID-19 disease.\n\nMethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of cases collected through an on-line survey distributed by the Euroguidelines in Central and Eastern Europe Network Group. In statistical analyses characteristics of HIV-positive patients asymptomatic/moderate and moderate/severe course were compared.\n\nResultsIn total 34 HIV-positive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were reported by 12 countries (Estonia, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Albania, Belarus, Romania, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Poland, Russia, Hungary, Bulgaria). Asymptomatic courses of COVID-19 were reported in four (12%) cases, 11 (32%) patients presented with mild disease not requiring hospitalization, moderate disease with respiratory and/or systemic symptoms was observed in 14 (41%) cases, and severe disease with respiratory failure was found in five (15%) patients. The only HIV-related characteristics differentiating a moderate/severe course of the disease from asymptomatic/mild disease course was the use of or PI or NNRTI as part of the cART regimen (40.0% vs. 5.3%, p=0.0129 for PI and 31.6 % vs. 0.0%, p= 0.0239 for NNRTI).\n\nConclusionsIn our analyses HIV viral suppression and immunological status were not playing a role in the course of COVID-19 disease. On the contrary the cART regimen could contribute to severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Large and prospective studies are necessary to further investigate this relations.",

CK value of all cases during disease course started from different initial time were analyzed.\n\nResultsAll cases underwent 504 tests of CK since symptom onset and the median value was 51.7 (35.0-91.5) U/L. The first median value on the day 8 from exposure onset was 78.1 (69.1-85.8) U/L then showed an upward trend from the day 8 to the day 12 (reaching a peak of 279.3 U/L), finally showed a fluctuation decline after the day 12. The CK median value in critical cases reached the peak (625.5 U/L) on the transforming date, and then decreased rapidly to the normal range. Before death, the CK median value in dead cases firstly increased until the day -14 with a peak as 470.0 U/L, then decreased with fluctuation until day -2, and finally increased again on the day 0.\n\nConclusionsCK reached its peak on the day when it became critical type, dynamic detection of CK can guide clinical judgment of prognosis. The increase of CK is a high risk factor of death. Severe cell damage 2 weeks before death might determines the outcome of the disease even if CK drops to the normal range afterward.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSensitive and high throughput molecular detection assays are essential during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The vast majority of the SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays use nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) or oropharyngeal swab (OPS) specimens collected from suspected individuals. However, using NPS or OPS as specimens has apparent drawbacks, e.g. the collection procedures for NPS or OPS specimens can be uncomfortable to some people and may cause sneezing and coughing which in turn generate droplets and/or aerosol particles that are of risk to healthcare workers, requiring heavy use of personal protective equipment. There have been recent studies indicating that self-collected saliva specimens can be used for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 and provides more comfort and ease of use for the patient. Here we report the performance of QuantiVirus SARS-CoV-2 multiplex test using saliva as the testing specimens with or without pooling.\n\nMethodsDevelopment and validation studies were conducted following FDA-EUA and molecular assay validation guidelines. Using SeraCare Accuplex SARS-CoV-2 reference panel, the limit of detection (LOD) and clinical evaluation studies were performed with the QuantiVirus SARS-CoV-2 multiplex test. For clinical evaluation, 85 known positive and 90 known negative clinical NPS samples were tested. Additionally, twenty paired NPS and saliva samples collected from recovering COVID-19 patients were tested and the results were further compared to that of the Abbott m2000 SARS-CoV-2 PCR assay. Results of community collected 389 saliva samples for COVID-19 screening by QuantiVirus SARS-CoV-2 multiplex test were also obtained and analyzed. Moreover, saliva pooling with 6 and 12 samples together were also evaluated.\n\nResultsThe LOD for the QuantiVirus SARS-CoV-2 multiplex test was confirmed to be 100-200 copies/mL. The clinical evaluation using contrived saliva samples indicated that the positive percentage agreement (PPA) of the QuantiVirus SARS-CoV-2 multiplex test is 100% at 1xLOD, 1.5xLOD and 2.5xLOD. No cross-reactivity was observed for the QuantiVirus SARS-CoV-2 multiplex test with common respiratory pathogens. Testing of clinical samples showed a positive percentage agreement (PPA) of 100% (95% CI: 94.6% to 100%) and a negative percentage agreement (NPA) of 98.9% (95% CI: 93.1% to 99.9%). QuantiVirus SARS CoV-2 multiplex test had 80% concordance rate and no significant difference (p=0.13) in paired saliva and NPS specimens by Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test. Positive test rate was 1.79% for 389 saliva specimens collected from the communities for COVID-19 screening. Preliminary data showed that saliva sample pooling up to 6 samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection is feasible (sensitivity 94.8% and specificity 100%).\n\nConclusionThe studies demonstrated that the QuantiVirus SARS-CoV-2 multiplex test has a LOD of 200 copies/mL in contrived saliva samples. The clinical performance of saliva-based testing is comparable to that of NPS-based testing. Pooling of saliva specimens for SARS-CoV-2 detection is feasible. Saliva based and high-throughput QuantiVirusSARS-CoV-2 multiplex test offers a highly desirable test during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of Simtomax(R) CoronaCheck, a serology rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for the detection of IgG and IgM against SARS-CoV-2. 48 plasma samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 based on RT-PCR and 98 negative control samples were studied. Diagnostic performance of the IgG/IgM RDT was assessed against RT-PCR and the electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) Elecsys(R) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total Ig. Overall, the RDT sensitivity was 92% (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 79-97), specificity 97% (95% CI: 91-99%), PPV 94% (95% CI: 81-98) and the NPV 96% (95% CI: 89-99). When considering only samples collected [&ge;] 15 days post-symptoms (DPS), the sensitivity increased to 98% (95%CI: 86-100) and the specificity was 97% (95% CI: 91-99%). Two samples with 180 DPS were still positive for IgG. Globally, this IgG/IgM RDT displayed a high diagnostic accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM detection in plasma samples in high COVID-19 prevalence settings. It could be effectively used, in absence of facilities for routine diagnostic serology, for samples with a DPS between 15 and 180 days.\n\nHighlights- The rapid diagnostic test Simtomax CoronaCheck displays a high sensitivity of 98% and a high specificity of 97% for SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM detection in plasma samples after 15 days post-symptoms.\n- The rapid diagnostic test Simtomax CoronaCheck can detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in plasma up to 180 days after symptom onset.\n- The rapid diagnostic test Simtomax CoronaCheck could be effectively used as an alternative to serological analysis using laboratory facilities.",

    "abstract": "Environmental surveillance of surface contamination is an unexplored tool for understanding transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in community settings. We conducted longitudinal swab sampling of high-touch non-porous surfaces in a Massachusetts town during a COVID-19 outbreak from April to June 2020. Twenty-nine of 348 (8.3 %) surface samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2, including crosswalk buttons, trash can handles, and door handles of essential business entrances (grocery store, liquor store, bank, and gas station). The estimated risk of infection from touching a contaminated surface was low (less than 5 in 10,000), suggesting fomites play a minimal role in SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. The weekly percentage of positive samples (out of n=33 unique surfaces per week) best predicted variation in city-level COVID-19 cases using a 7-day lead time. Environmental surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on high-touch surfaces could be a useful tool to provide early warning of COVID-19 case trends.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCoronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has spread all over the world and brought extremely huge losses. There is no study to systematically analyse the features of hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (-HBDH) in COVID-19 patients during the periods before and after illness progression, before death and course from exposure onset.\n\nMethodsWe collected all included patients general information, clinical type, -HBDH value and outcome, and analyzed -HBDH values within different initial time and different periods.\n\nResultsIn the first 30 days after symptom onset, the -HBDH median value was 156.33 U/L. The first test of -HBDH since exposure onset appeared on the 8th day, it increased from the 8th day to 18th day and decreased after the 18th day. -HBDH median value showed a slight change until it started to increase 1 day before transforming to severe type, while it continued to increase during 4 days before and after transforming to critical type. The -HBDH median value ranged from 191.11 U/L to 455.11U/L before death.\n\nConclusions-HBDH value increases in some COVID-19 patients, obviously in severe type, critical type and death patients, and mainly in 18 days after exposure onset and 10 days after symptom onset. -HBDH increases 1 day before transforming to severe type, continues to increase in critical type and death patients, increases rapidly 5 days before death. The increase of -HBDH suggests that COVID-19 patients have tissues and organs damage, mainly in heart. In brief, -HBDH is an important indicator to judge the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.",

Women may be especially vulnerable to depression and anxiety due to the pandemic,\n\nAIMSThis study attempted to assess how gender impacts risk perceptions, anxiety levels behavioral responses to the COVID 19 pandemic in Pakistan in order to recommend gender responsive health policies\n\nMETHODSA cross-sectional online survey was conducted. Participants were asked to complete a sociodemographic data form, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and questions on their risk perceptions, preventive behavior and information exposure. Regression analysis was used to assess effects of factors such as age, gender and household income on anxiety levels.\n\nRESULTSOf the 1390 respondents, 478 were women, and 913 were men. Women considered their chances of survival to be relatively lower than men (59 % women vs 73% men). They were also more anxious (62% women vs 50% men), and more likely to adopt precautionary behavior, such as avoiding going to the hospital (78% women vs. 71% men), not going to work (72% women and 57% men), and using disinfectants (93% women and 86% men). Men were more likely to trust friends, family and social media as reliable sources of COVID-19 information, while women were more likely to trust doctors.\n\nCONCLUSIONWomen experience a disproportion burden of the psychological and social impact of the pandemic compared to men. Involving doctors in healthcare communication targeting women, might prove effective. Social media and radio programs may be effective in disseminating information related to COVID among men.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 outcomes reflect organ-specific interplay of SARS-CoV-2 and its receptor, ACE2, with TMPRSS2 and ADAM17. Confirmed active tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in epithelial cells of intestine and kidney proximal tubule, and in aging cardiomyocytes, capriciously manifests extra-pulmonary organ-related clinical symptoms in about half of COVID-19 patients, occurring by poorly understood mechanisms. We approached this knowledge gap by recognizing a clue that these three particular cell types share a common denominator kindred of uniquely expressing the SLC6A19 neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1 protein (alternatively called NBB, B, B0) serving glutamine and tryptophan uptake. B0AT1 is a cellular trafficking chaperone partner of ACE2, shown by cryo-EM to form a thermodynamically-favored stabilized 2ACE2:2B0AT1 dimer-of-heterodimers. The gut is the bodys site of greatest magnitude expression depot of both ACE2 and B0AT1. This starkly contrasts with pulmonary pneumocyte expression of monomeric ACE2 with conspicuously undetectable B0AT1. We hypothesized that B0AT1 steers the organ-related interplay amongst ACE2, TMPRSS2, ADAM17, and SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The present study employed molecular docking modeling that indicated active site catalytic pocket residues of TMPRSS2 and ADAM17 each formed bonds [&le;] 2 A with monomer ACE2 specific residues within a span R652-D713 involved in cleaving sACE2 soluble ectodomain release. These bonds are consistent with competitive binding interactions of experimental anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug small molecules including Camostat and Nafamostat. Without B0AT1, ACE2 residues K657 and N699 dominated docking bonding with TMPRSS2 or ADAM17 active sites, with ACE2 R710 and R709 contributing electrostatic attractions, but notably ACE2 S708 never closer than 16-44 A. However, in the dimer-of-heterodimers arrangement all ACE2 neck region residues were limited to TMPRSS2 or ADAM17 approaches 35 A, with the interference directly attributed to the presence of a neighboring B0AT1 subunit complexed to the partnering ACE2 subunit of 2ACE2:2B0AT1; ADAM17 failed to dock by bumping its active site pocket oriented dysfunctionally outwardly facing 1800 away. Results were the same whether the dimer-of-heterodimers was in either the \"closed\" or \"open\" conformation, or whether or not SARS-CoV-2 RBD was complexed to ACE2. The results implicate B0AT1-and in particular the 2ACE2:2B0AT1 complex-as a maJor player in the landscape of COVID-19 pathophysiology engaging TMPRSS2 and ADAM17, consistent with experimental evidence in the literature and in clinical reports. These findings provide a gateway to understanding the roles of B0AT1 relating to COVID-19 manifestations putatively assigned to intestinal and renal epithelial cells and cardiomyocytes, with underpinnings useful for considerations in public hygiene policy and drug development.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundConcerns have been raised that the response to the UK COVID-19 pandemic may have worsened physical and mental health, and reduced use of health services. However, the scale of the problem is unquantified, impeding development of effective mitigations. We asked what has happened to general practice contacts for acute physical and mental health outcomes during the pandemic?\n\nMethodsUsing electronic health records from the Clinical Research Practice Datalink (CPRD) Aurum (2017-2020), we calculated weekly primary care contacts for selected acute physical and mental health conditions (including: anxiety, depression, acute alcohol-related events, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] exacerbations, cardiovascular and diabetic emergencies). We used interrupted time series (ITS) analysis to formally quantify changes in conditions after the introduction of population-wide restrictions ( lockdown) compared to the period prior to their introduction in March 2020.\n\nFindingsThe overall population included 9,863,903 individuals on 1st January 2017. Primary care contacts for all conditions dropped dramatically after introduction of population-wide restrictions. By July 2020, except for unstable angina and acute alcohol-related events, contacts for all conditions had not recovered to pre-lockdown levels. The largest reductions were for contacts for: diabetic emergencies (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.25-0.50), depression (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.52-0.53), and self-harm (OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.54-0.58).\n\nInterpretationThere were substantial reductions in primary care contacts for acute physical and mental conditions with restrictions, with limited recovery by July 2020. It is likely that much of the deficit in care represents unmet need, with implications for subsequent morbidity and premature mortality. The conditions we studied are sufficiently severe that any unmet need will have substantial ramifications for the people experiencing the conditions and healthcare provision. Maintaining access must be a key priority in future public health planning (including further restrictions).\n\nFundingWellcome Trust Senior Fellowship (SML), Health Data Research UK.\n\nRESULTS IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSA small study in 47 GP practices in a largely deprived, urban area of the UK (Salford) reported that primary care consultations for four broad diagnostic groups (circulatory disease, common mental health problems, type 2 diabetes mellitus and malignant cancer) declined by 16-50% between March and May 2020, compared to what was expected based on data from January 2010 to March 2020. We searched Medline for other relevant evidence of the indirect effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical and mental health from inception to September 25th 2020, for articles published in English, with titles including the search terms (\"covid*\" or \"coronavirus\" or \"sars-cov-2\"), and title or abstracts including the search terms (\"indirect impact\" or \"missed diagnos*\" or \"missing diagnos*\" or \"delayed diagnos*\" or ((\"present*\" or \"consult*\" or \"engag*\" or \"access*\") AND (\"reduction\" or \"decrease\" or \"decline\")). We found no further studies investigating the change in primary care contacts for specific physical- and mental-health conditions indirectly resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or its control measures. There has been a reduction in hospital admissions and presentations to accident and emergency departments in the UK, particularly for myocardial infarctions and cerebrovascular accidents. However, there is no published evidence specifically investigating the changes in primary care contacts for severe acute physical and mental health conditions.\n\nAdded value of this studyTo our knowledge this is the first study to explore changes in healthcare contacts for acute physical and mental health conditions in a large population representative of the UK. We used electronic primary care health records of nearly 10 million individuals across the UK to investigate the indirect impact of COVID-19 on primary care contacts for mental health, acute alcohol-related events, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, and cardiovascular and diabetic emergencies up to July 2020. For all conditions studied, we found primary care contacts dropped dramatically following the introduction of population-wide restriction measures in March 2020. By July 2020, with the exception of unstable angina and acute alcohol-related events, primary care contacts for all conditions studied had not recovered to pre-lockdown levels. In the general population, estimates of the absolute reduction in the number of primary care contacts up to July 2020, compared to what we would expect from previous years varied from fewer than 10 contacts per million for some cardiovascular outcomes, to 12,800 per million for depression and 6,600 for anxiety. In people with COPD, we estimated there were 43,900 per million fewer contacts for COPD exacerbations up to July 2020 than what we would expect from previous years.\n\nImplicatins of all the available evidenceWhile our results may represent some genuine reduction in disease frequency (e.g. the restriction measures may have improved diabetic glycaemic control due to more regular daily routines at home), it is more likely the reduced primary care conatcts we saw represent a substantial burden of unmet need (particularly for mental health conditions) that may be reflected in subsequent increased mortality and morbidity. Health service providers should take steps to prepare for increased demand in the coming months and years due to the short and longterm ramifications of reduced access to care for severe acute physical and mental health conditions. Maintaining access to primary care is key to future public health planning in relation to the pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Multiple studies have shown loss of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies over time after infection, raising concern that humoral immunity against the virus is not durable. If immunity wanes quickly, millions of people may be at risk for reinfection after recovery from COVID-19. However, memory B cells (MBC) could provide durable humoral immunity even if serum neutralizing antibody titers decline. We performed multi-dimensional flow cytometric analysis of S protein receptor binding domain (S-RBD)-specific MBC in cohorts of ambulatory COVID-19 patients with mild disease, and hospitalized patients with moderate to severe disease, at a median of 54 (39-104) days after onset of symptoms. We detected S-RBD-specific class-switched MBC in 13 out of 14 participants, including 4 of the 5 participants with lowest plasma levels of anti-S-RBD IgG and neutralizing antibodies. Resting MBC (rMBC) made up the largest proportion of S-RBD-specific class-switched MBC in both cohorts. FCRL5, a marker of functional memory when expressed on rMBC, was dramatically upregulated on S-RBD-specific rMBC. These data indicate that most SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals develop S-RBD-specific, class-switched MBC that phenotypically resemble germinal center-derived B cells induced by effective vaccination against other pathogens, providing evidence for durable B cell-mediated immunity against SARS-CoV-2 after recovery from mild or severe COVID-19 disease.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=125 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/20220996v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@89a49borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@95cac0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@320bc1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a1da2a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVarious levels of lockdown implemented to contain the rapid spread of COVID-19 are not long-term solutions due to socioeconomic implications.\n\nMethodsTo inform safe reopening, we used an augmented SEIR model to project the impact of 1) interventions and potential new epidemic trajectories arising from super spreader (SS) events and/or international travel and 2) re-introducing strong behavioural interventions on resurgence trajectories.\n\nResultsOur model suggests that 50% behaviour intervention effectiveness (BIE) (from enforced social distancing during lockdown, early in the epidemic), along with 50% isolation intervention effectiveness (IIE) (from increased testing and isolating infected individuals) was achieved during lockdown, which curbed COVID-19 transmission in Malaysia. Post-lockdown, BIE plays a minimal role if IIE reaches or exceeds 46.9% when other variables are held constant. At IIE of 30% and BIE of 21.3%, SS events of 5,000 active cases risks COVID-19 resurgence, with 4-year projected 12.9mn cumulative cases and 1.1mn deaths. Earlier action to increase BIE to 50% on day 98 compared to day 111, prevented an additional 21,401 recovered cases and 257 deaths.\n\nConclusionUntil a safe and effective vaccine is widely available, the risk of COVID-19 resurgence from large SS events warrants caution in decisions to allow for mass gatherings and regular international travel.",

    "abstract": "The current diagnostic gold-standard for SARS-CoV-2 clearance from infected patients is two consecutive negative PCR test results. However, there are anecdotal reports of hospitalization from protracted COVID complications despite such confirmed viral clearance, presenting a clinical conundrum. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 266 COVID patients to compare those that were admitted/re-admitted post-viral clearance (hospitalized post-clearance cohort, n=93) with those that were hospitalized pre-clearance but were not re-admitted post-viral clearance (non-hospitalized post-clearance cohort, n=173). In order to differentiate these two cohorts, we used neural network models for the augmented curation of comorbidities and complications with positive sentiment in the EHR physician notes. In the year preceding COVID onset, acute kidney injury (n=15 (16.1%), p-value: 0.03), anemia (n=20 (21.5%), p-value: 0.02), and cardiac arrhythmia (n=21 (22.6%), p-value: 0.05) were significantly enriched in the physician notes of the hospitalized post-clearance cohort. This study highlights that these specific pre-existing conditions are associated with amplified hospitalization risk in COVID patients, despite their successful SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance. Our finding that pre-COVID anemia amplifies risk of post-COVID hospitalization is particularly concerning given the high prevalence and endemic nature of anemia in many low- and middle-income countries (per the World Bank definition; e.g. India, Brazil), which are unfortunately also seeing high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-induced mortality. This study motivates follow-up prospective research into the specific risk factors we have identified that appear to predispose some patients towards the after effects of COVID-19.\n\nArticle summary - Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIThis is the first study at a major healthcare center analyzing risk factors for post-viral clearance hospitalization of COVID-19 patients.\nC_LIO_LIThis analysis uses augmented curation methods to identify complications and comorbidities from the physician notes, rather than relying upon ICD codes.\nC_LIO_LIThe statistical analysis identifies specific comorbidities in the year preceding PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 which are associated with increased rates of post-viral clearance hospitalization.\nC_LIO_LIThe dataset used for this study is limited to a single healthcare system, so the underlying clinical characteristics of the study population are biased to reflect the clinical characteristics of individuals that receive medical treatment in certain regions of the United States (Arizona, Florida, Minnesota).\nC_LIO_LIIn this study, we use the first of two consecutive negative PCR tests to estimate the viral clearance date for each patient, however the true viral clearance date for each patient is unknown.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMultiple candidates of COVID-19 vaccines have entered Phase III clinical trials in the United States (US). There is growing optimism that social distancing restrictions and face mask requirements could be eased with widespread vaccine adoption soon.\n\nMethodsWe developed a dynamic compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission for the four most severely affected states (New York, Texas, Florida, and California). We evaluated the vaccine effectiveness and coverage required to suppress the COVID-19 epidemic in scenarios when social contact was to return to pre-pandemic levels and face mask use was reduced. Daily and cumulative COVID-19 infection and death cases were obtained from the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus resource center and used for model calibration.\n\nResultsWithout a vaccine, the spread of COVID-19 could be suppressed in these states by maintaining strict social distancing measures and face mask use levels. But relaxing social distancing restrictions to the pre-pandemic level without changing the current face mask use would lead to a new COVID-19 outbreak, resulting in 0.8-4 million infections and 15,000-240,000 deaths across these four states over the next 12 months. In this scenario, introducing a vaccine would partially offset this negative impact even if the vaccine effectiveness and coverage are relatively low. However, if face mask use is reduced by 50%, a vaccine that is only 50% effective (weak vaccine) would require coverage of 55-94% to suppress the epidemic in these states. A vaccine that is 80% effective (moderate vaccine) would only require 32-57% coverage to suppress the epidemic. In contrast, if face mask usage stops completely, a weak vaccine would not suppress the epidemic, and further major outbreaks would occur. A moderate vaccine with coverage of 48-78% or a strong vaccine (100% effective) with coverage of 33-58% would be required to suppress the epidemic. Delaying vaccination rollout for 1-2 months would not substantially alter the epidemic trend if the current interventions are maintained.\n\nConclusionsThe degree to which the US population can relax social distancing restrictions and face mask use will depend greatly on the effectiveness and coverage of a potential COVID-19 vaccine if future epidemics are to be prevented. Only a highly effective vaccine will enable the US population to return to life as it was before the pandemic.",

Leading comorbidities associated with COVID-19 mortality included sickle cell disease (aOR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.21-2.47), chronic kidney disease (aOR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.29-1.36), leukemias and lymphomas (aOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.14-1.30), heart failure (aOR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.16-1.22), and diabetes (aOR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.15-1.22).\n\nConclusionsWe created a personalized risk prediction calculator to identify candidates for early vaccine and therapeutics allocation (www.predictcovidrisk.com). These findings may be used to protect those at greatest risk of death from COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesTo describe symptomatology, mortality and risk factors for mortality in a large group of Dutch nursing home (NH) residents with clinically-suspected COVID-19 who were tested with a Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test.\n\nDesignProspective cohort study.\n\nSetting and participantsResidents of Dutch NHs with clinically-suspected COVID-19 and who received RT-PCR test.\n\nMethodsWe collected data of NH residents with clinically-suspected COVID-19, via electronic health records between March 18th and May 13th, 2020. Registration was performed on diagnostic status (confirmed (COVID-19+)/ruled out (COVID-19-)) and symptomatology (typical and atypical symptoms). Information on mortality and risk factors for mortality were extracted from usual care data.\n\nResultsIn our sample of residents with clinically-suspected COVID-19 (N=4007), COVID-19 was confirmed in 1538 residents (38%). Although, symptomatology overlapped between residents with COVID-19+ and COVID-19-, those with COVID-19+ were three times more likely to die within 30 days (hazard ratio (HR), 3{middle dot}1; 95% CI, 2{middle dot}7 to 3{middle dot}6). Within this group, mortality was higher for men than for women (HR, 1{middle dot}8; 95%, 1{middle dot}5-2{middle dot}2) and we observed a higher mortality for residents with dementia, reduced kidney function, and Parkinsons Disease, even when corrected for age, gender, and comorbidities.\n\nConclusions and implicationsAbout 40% of the residents with clinically-suspected COVID-19 actually had COVID-19, based on the RT-PCR test. Despite an overlap in symptomatology, mortality rate was three times higher for residents with COVID-19+. This emphasizes the importance of using low-threshold testing in NH residents which is an essential prerequisite to using limited personal protective equipment and isolation measures efficiently.",

    "abstract": "Herein we provide a living summary of the data generated during the COVID Moonshot project focused on the development of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitors. Our approach uniquely combines crowdsourced medicinal chemistry insights with high throughput crystallography, exascale computational chemistry infrastructure for simulations, and machine learning in triaging designs and predicting synthetic routes. This manuscript describes our methodologies leading to both covalent and non-covalent inhibitors displaying protease IC50 values under 150 nM and viral inhibition under 5 uM in multiple different viral replication assays. Furthermore, we provide over 200 crystal structures of fragment-like and lead-like molecules in complex with the main protease. Over 1000 synthesized and ordered compounds are also reported with the corresponding activity in Mpro enzymatic assays using two different experimental setups. The data referenced in this document will be continually updated to reflect the current experimental progress of the COVID Moonshot project, and serves as a citable reference for ensuing publications. All of the generated data is open to other researchers who may find it of use.",

    "abstract": "Antibody engineering technologies face increasing demands for speed, reliability and scale. We developed CeVICA, a cell-free antibody engineering platform that integrates a novel generation method and design for camelid heavy-chain antibody VHH domain-based synthetic libraries, optimized in vitro selection based on ribosome display and a computational pipeline for binder prediction based on CDR-directed clustering. We applied CeVICA to engineer antibodies against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and identified >800 predicted binder families. Among 14 experimentally-tested binders, 6 showed inhibition of pseudotyped virus infection. Antibody affinity maturation further increased binding affinity and potency of inhibition. Additionally, the unique capability of CeVICA for efficient and comprehensive binder prediction allowed retrospective validation of the fitness of our synthetic VHH library design and revealed direction for future refinement. CeVICA offers an integrated solution to rapid generation of divergent synthetic antibodies with tunable affinities in vitro and may serve as the basis for automated and highly parallel antibody generation.",

Immunizations using three different doses of PRAK-03202 induces antigen specific (Spike, envelope and membrane proteins) humoral response and neutralizing potential. PBMCs from convalescent patients, when exposed to PRAK-03202, showed lymphocyte proliferation and elevated IFN-{gamma} levels suggestive of conservation of epitopes and induction of T helper 1 (Th1)-biased cellular immune responses. These data support the clinical development and testing of PRAK-03202 for use in humans.",

    "abstract": "Seasonal coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1) are endemic to the human population, regularly infecting and reinfecting humans while typically causing asymptomatic to mild respiratory infections. It is not known to what extent reinfection by these viruses is due to waning immune memory or antigenic drift of the viruses. Here, we address the influence of antigenic drift on immune evasion of seasonal coronaviruses. We provide evidence that at least two of these viruses, OC43 and 229E, are undergoing adaptive evolution in regions of the viral spike protein that are exposed to human humoral immunity. This suggests that reinfection may be due, in part, to positively-selected genetic changes in these viruses that enable them to escape recognition by the immune system. It is possible that, as with seasonal influenza, these adaptive changes in antigenic regions of the virus would necessitate continual reformulation of a vaccine made against them.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Covid-19 pandemic has caused generous and well-developed healthcare systems to collapse. This paper quantifies how much system congestion may have increased mortality rates, using distance to the ICU as a proxy for access to emergency care.\n\nMethodsWe match daily death registry data for almost 1,500 municipalities in Lombardy, Italy, to data on geographical location of all ICU beds in the region. We then analyze how system congestion increases mortality in municipalities that are far from the ICU through a differences-in-differences regression model.\n\nFindingsWe find that Covid-19 mortality is up to 60% higher in the average municipality - which is 15 minutes driving away from the closest ICU - than in a municipality with an ICU in town. This difference is larger in areas and in days characterized by an abnormal number of calls to the emergency line.\n\nInterpretationWe interpret these results as suggesting that a sudden surge of critical patients may have congested the healthcare system, forcing emergency medical services to prioritize patients in the most proximate communities in order to maximize the number of lives saved. Through some back-of-the-envelope calculations, we estimate that Lombardys death toll from the first Covid-19 outbreak could have been 25% lower had all municipalities had ready access to the ICU. Drawing a lesson from Lombardys tale, governments should strengthen the emergency care response and palliate geographical inequalities to ensure that everyone in need can receive critical care on time during new outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "PurposeDetermining the triggering factor of the sudden boost of the daily reported new COVID-19 cases arising in most European countries during 2020 Autumn.\n\nMethodsThe dates of the boost were determined using an automatic fitting of the two last months reported daily new cases in 18 European countries of latitude ranging from 39{degrees} to 62{degrees}.\n\nResultsThe present study proves no correlation between the country boost date and its 2 weeks preceding temperature, but shows an impressive linear correlation with its latitude. The country boost date corresponds to the time when its sun UV daily dose drops below 30% of that of 0{degrees} latitude.\n\nConclusionsPrevious studies compared covid-19 severity between different populations. In contrary, the date of the boost is an intrapopulation observation and can thus be only triggered by a parameter globally affecting the population, i.e. the sun UV daily dose decreases. This result supports low vitamin blood D level as a real primary cause of COVID-19 severity. Europe and US could thus sink into a long crisis, since they will get back above the October sun UV dose only end 2021 March.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic and governmental lockdown measures disproportionally impacts older adults. This study presents the results from a psychiatric helpline for older adults in Mannheim, Germany, during the lockdown, set up to provide information and psychosocial support measures. We aim to elucidate the needs of older adults, their reported changes and the psychological impact during the initial stages of the health crisis.\n\nMethods55 older adults called the psychiatric helpline between April and June 2020. Information on demographics, previous diagnosis of psychiatric and somatic diseases as well as changes in daily life due to the pandemic was collected anonymously. Current mental health status was assessed using the depression HAMD-7 and the anxiety HAM-A scales.\n\nResultsMost callers were women, older adults (M = 74.69 years), single and retired. 69% of callers reported new or an increase in psychiatric symptoms, with anxiety and depressive symptoms being the most common ones. Age was significantly negatively correlated to higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. Individuals with a previous diagnosis of a psychiatric disease reported significantly higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than those without a diagnosis.\n\nConclusionIn older adults, the perceived psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis appears to ameliorate with age. Individuals with a history of psychiatric disease are most vulnerable to negative mental health outcomes. Rapid response in the form of a geriatric helpline are useful initiatives to support the needs and the psychological well-being of older adults during a health crisis.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe management of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 should rely on early recognition of the risk for progression to severe respiratory failure (SRF) and its prevention. We investigated if early suPAR (soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor)-guided anakinra treatment could prevent COVID-19-assocated SRF.\n\nMethodsIn this open-label prospective trial, 130 patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia SARS-CoV-2 and suPAR levels [&ge;]6 g/l were assigned to subcutaneous anakinra 100mg once daily for 10 days. The primary outcome was the incidence of SRF at day 14. Secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality, changes in sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, of cytokine-stimulation pattern and of circulating inflammatory mediators. Equal number of propensity score-matched comparators for comorbidities, severity on admission and standard-of care (SOC) were studied.\n\nResultsThe incidence of SRF was 22.3% (95% CI, 16.0-30.2%) among anakinra-treated patients and 59.2% (95% CI, 50.6-67.3%; P: 4.6 x 10-8) among SOC comparators (hazard ratio, 0.30; 95%CI, 0.20-0.46). 30-day mortality was 11.5% (95% CI, 7.1-18.2%) and 22.3% (95% CI, 16.0-30.2%) respectively (hazard ratio 0.49; 95% CI 0.25-0.97%; P: 0.041). Anakinra treatment was associated with decrease in SOFA score and in circulating interleukin (IL)-6, sCD163 and sIL2-R; the serum IL-10/IL-6 ratio on day 7 was inversely associated with the change in SOFA score. Duration of stay at the intensive care unit and at hospital was shortened compared to the SOC group; the cost of hospitalization was decreased.\n\nConclusionsEarly suPAR-guided anakinra treatment is associated with decrease of the risk for SRF and restoration of the pro- /anti-inflammatory balance.\n\nTrial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04357366",

    "abstract": "While SARS-CoV-2 infection has pleiotropic and systemic effects in some patients, many others experience milder symptoms. We sought a holistic understanding of the severe/mild distinction in COVID-19 pathology, and its origins. We performed a whole-blood preserving single-cell analysis protocol to integrate contributions from all major cell types including neutrophils, monocytes, platelets, lymphocytes and the contents of serum. Patients with mild COVID-19 disease display a coordinated pattern of interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression across every cell population and these cells are systemically absent in patients with severe disease. Severe COVID-19 patients also paradoxically produce very high anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and have lower viral load as compared to mild disease. Examination of the serum from severe patients demonstrates that they uniquely produce antibodies with multiple patterns of specificity against interferon-stimulated cells and that those antibodies functionally block the production of the mild disease-associated ISG-expressing cells. Overzealous and auto-directed antibody responses pit the immune system against itself in many COVID-19 patients and this defines targets for immunotherapies to allow immune systems to provide viral defense.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryIn severe COVID-19 patients, the immune system fails to generate cells that define mild disease; antibodies in their serum actively prevents the successful production of those cells.",

    "abstract": "We have previously reported that the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody, STI-2020, potently inhibits cytopathic effects of infection by genetically diverse clinical SARS-CoV-2 pandemic isolates in vitro, and has demonstrated efficacy in a hamster model of COVID-19 when administered by the intravenous route immediately following infection. We now have extended our in vivo studies of STI-2020 to include disease treatment efficacy, profiling of biodistribution of STI-2020 in mice when antibody is delivered intranasally (IN) or intravenously (IV), as well as pharmacokinetics in mice following IN antibody administration. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters were treated with STI-2020 using these routes, and treatment effects on severity and duration of COVID-19-like disease in this model were evaluated. In SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters, treatment with STI-2020 12 hours post-infection using the IN route led to a decrease in severity of clinical disease signs and a more robust recovery during 9 days of infection as compared to animals treated with an isotype control antibody. Treatment via the IV route using the same dose and timing regimen resulted in a decrease in the average number of consecutive days that infected animals experienced weight loss, shortening the duration of disease and allowing recovery to begin more rapidly in STI-2020 treated animals. Following IN administration in mice, STI-2020 was detected within 10 minutes in both lung tissue and lung lavage. The half-life of STI-2020 in lung tissue is approximately 25 hours. We are currently investigating the minimum effective dose of IN-delivered STI-2020 in the hamster model as well as establishing the relative benefit of delivering neutralizing antibodies by both IV and IN routes.",

    "abstract": "Current transmission rates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are still increasing and many countries are facing second waves of infections. Rapid SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing (WGS) is often unavailable but could support public health organizations and hospitals in monitoring and determining transmission links. Here we report a novel reverse complement polymerase chain reaction (RC-PCR) technology for WGS of SARS-CoV-2. This technique is unique as it enables library preparation in a single PCR saving time, resources and enables high throughput screening. A total of 173 samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March and September 2020 were included. RC-PCR WGS applicability for outbreak analysis in public health service and hospital settings was tested on six predefined clusters containing samples of healthcare workers and patients. RC-PCR resulted in WGS data for 146 samples. It showed a genome coverage of up to 98,2% for samples with a maximum Ct value of 32. Three out of six suspected clusters were fully confirmed, while in other clusters four healthcare workers were not associated. Importantly, a previously unknown chain of transmission was confirmed in the public health service samples. These findings confirm the reliability and applicability of the RC-PCR technology for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing in outbreak analysis and surveillance.",

We discuss the tools, platforms, and guidelines necessary for the distributed development of its contents by a multi-faceted community of biocurators, domain experts, bioinformaticians, and computational biologists. We highlight the role of relevant databases and text mining approaches in enrichment and validation of the curated mechanisms. We describe the contents of the map and their relevance to the molecular pathophysiology of COVID-19 and the analytical and computational modelling approaches that can be applied to the contents of the COVID-19 Disease Map for mechanistic data interpretation and predictions. We conclude by demonstrating concrete applications of our work through several use cases.",

    "abstract": "Severe manifestations of COVID-19 are mostly restricted to persons with comorbidities, and they form a significantly high proportion of those which develop life-endangering lung injury. Nevertheless, COVID-19 animal models established to date are not based on preexistence of comorbidities. Here we report that mild pulmonary injury induced by administration of acute-lung-injury stimulants, renders outbred CD-1 mice to be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2. Following intranasal pretreatment of mice with low doses of ricin or bleomycin, SARS-CoV-2 infection caused a severe disease manifested by sustained body loss and mortality rates of >50%. Low-dose-ricin pretreated mice displayed markedly higher levels of viral RNA than mice not pretreated with ricin, not only in the nasal turbinate, trachea and lungs but also in the serum and heart. The deleterious effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in ricin-pretreated mice were effectively alleviated by passive transfer of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies generated against SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Notably, viral cell entry in the sensitized mice model seems to involve viral RBD binding, albeit by a mechanism other than the canonical ACE2-mediated uptake route. In summary, we present a novel animal model in mice that express native murine ACE2 yet are susceptible to genetically unaltered SARS-CoV-2, for the study of comorbidity-dependent COVID-19 pathology and treatment.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out genetic screens are powerful approaches to unravel new regulators of viral infections. With the aim of identifying new cellular inhibitors of HIV-1, we have developed a strategy in which we took advantage of the ability of type 1 interferon (IFN) to potently inhibit HIV-1 infection, in order to create a cellular environment hostile to viral replication. This approach led to the identification of the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX42 as an intrinsic inhibitor of HIV-1. Depletion of endogenous DDX42 using siRNA or CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out increased HIV-1 infection, both in model cell lines and in physiological targets of HIV-1, primary CD4+ T cells and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), and irrespectively of the IFN treatment. Similarly, the overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of DDX42 positively impacted HIV-1 infection, whereas wild-type DDX42 overexpression potently inhibited HIV-1 infection. The positive impact of endogenous DDX42 depletion on HIV-1 infection was directly correlated to an increase in viral DNA accumulation. Interestingly, proximity ligation assays showed that DDX42, which can be mainly found in the nucleus but is also present in the cytoplasm, was in the close vicinity of HIV-1 Capsid during infection of primary monocyte-derived macrophages. Moreover, we show that DDX42 is also able to substantially decrease infection with other retroviruses and retrotransposition of long interspersed elements-1 (LINE-1). Finally, we reveal that DDX42 potently inhibits other pathogenic viruses, including Chikungunya virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).",

    "abstract": "Infections with zoonotic viruses, such as flaviviruses, influenza virus, and the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic coronavirus constitute an increasing global risk. Hence, an urgent need exists for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals to prevent such outbreaks. Here, we show that the maduramycin and CP-80,219 aglycone polyether ionophores exhibit effective broad-spectrum antiviral activity, against various viruses, including Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), while also exhibiting promising activity against PR8 influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, liposome-encapsulated maduramycin and CP-80,219 provide full protection for mice from infection with JEV in vivo. Mechanistic studies suggest that aglycone polyether ionophores primarily inhibit the viral replication step without blocking endosome acidification to promote the fusion between viral and cellular membranes. The successful application of liposomes containing aglycone polyether ionophores in JEV-infected mice offers hope to the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs like penicillin back to 1940s.",

    "abstract": "Remdesivir is the only FDA-approved drug for the treatment of COVID-19 patients1-4. The active form of remdesivir acts as a nucleoside analogue and inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-25-7. Remdesivir is incorporated by the RdRp into the growing RNA product and allows for addition of three more nucleotides before RNA synthesis stalls6,8. Here we use synthetic RNA chemistry, biochemistry and cryo-electron microscopy to establish the molecular mechanism of remdesivir-induced RdRp stalling. We show that addition of the fourth nucleotide following remdesivir incorporation into the RNA product is impaired by a barrier to further RNA translocation. This translocation barrier causes retention of the RNA 3-nucleotide in the substrate-binding site of the RdRp and interferes with entry of the next nucleoside triphosphate, thereby stalling RdRp. In the structure of the remdesivir-stalled state, the 3-nucleotide of the RNA product is matched with the template base, and this may prevent proofreading by the viral 3-exonuclease that recognizes mismatches9,10. These mechanistic insights should facilitate the quest for improved antivirals that target coronavirus replication.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 virus caused one of the severest pandemic around the world. The vaccine development for urgent use became more of an issue during the pandemic. An inactivated virus formulated vaccines such as Hepatitis A, inactivated polio, and influenza has been proven to be a reliable approach for immunization for long years. In this pandemic, we produced an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate by modification of the oldest but the most experienced method that can be produced quickly and tested easily rather than the recombinant vaccines. Here, we optimized an inactivated virus vaccine which includes the gamma irradiation process for the inactivation as an alternative to classical chemical inactivation methods so that there is no extra purification required. Also, we applied the vaccine candidate (OZG-38.61.3) using the intradermal route in mice which decreased the requirement of a higher concentration of inactivated virus for proper immunization unlike most of the classical inactivated vaccine treatments. Thus, the novelty of our vaccine candidate (OZG-38.61.3) is a non-adjuvant added, gamma-irradiated, and intradermally applied inactive viral vaccine. We first determined the efficiency and safety dose (either 1013 or 1014 viral copy per dose) of the OZG-38.61.3 in Balb/c mice. Next, to test the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the OZG-38.61.3, we immunized human ACE2-encoding transgenic mice and infected them with a dose of infective SARS-CoV-2 virus for the challenge test. We showed that the vaccinated mice showed lowered SARS-CoV-2 viral copy number in oropharyngeal specimens along with humoral and cellular immune responses against the SARS-CoV-2, including the neutralizing antibodies similar to those shown in Balb/c mice without substantial toxicity. This study encouraged us towards a new promising strategy for inactivated vaccine development (OZG-38.61.3) and the Phase 1 clinical trial for the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) emerge as essential mediators of intercellular communication. DNA vaccines encoding antigens presented on EVs efficiently induce T-cell responses and EV-based vaccines containing the Spike (S) proteins of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) are highly immunogenic in mice. Thus, EVs may serve as vaccine platforms against emerging diseases, going beyond traditional strategies, with the antigen displayed identically to the original protein embedded in the viral membrane and presented as such to the immune system. Compared to their viral and pseudotyped counterparts, EV-based vaccines overcome many safety issues including pre-existing immunity against these vectors. Here, we applied our technology in natural EVs engineering, to express the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 embedded in the EVs, which mimic the virus with its fully native spikes. Immunizations with a two component CoVEVax vaccine, comprising DNA vector (DNAS-EV) primes, allowing in situ production of Spike harbouring EVs, and a boost using S-EVs produced in mammalian cells, trigger potent neutralizing and cellular responses in mice, in the absence of any adjuvants. CoVEVax would be the prototype of vaccines, where the sole exchange of the envelope proteins on EVs leads to the generation of new vaccine candidates against emerging viruses.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 can infect multiple organs, including lung, intestine, kidney, heart, liver, and brain. The molecular details of how the virus navigates through diverse cellular environments and establishes replication are poorly defined. Here, we performed global proteomic analysis of the virus-host interface in a newly established panel of phenotypically diverse, SARS-CoV-2-infectable human cell lines representing different body organs. This revealed universal inhibition of interferon signaling across cell types following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We performed systematic analyses of the JAK-STAT pathway in a broad range of cellular systems, including immortalized cell lines and primary-like cardiomyocytes, and found that several pathway components were targeted by SARS-CoV-2 leading to cellular desensitization to interferon. These findings indicate that the suppression of interferon signaling is a mechanism widely used by SARS-CoV-2 in diverse tissues to evade antiviral innate immunity, and that targeting the viral mediators of immune evasion may help block virus replication in patients with COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The current COVID-19 pandemic requires urgent development of effective therapeutics. 5-amino levulinic acid (5-ALA) is a naturally synthesized amino acid and has been used for multiple purposes including as an anticancer therapy and as a dietary supplement due to its high bioavailability. In this study, we demonstrated that 5-ALA treatment potently inhibited infection of SARS-CoV-2, a causative agent of COVID-19. The antiviral effects could be detected in both human and non-human cells, without significant cytotoxicity. Therefore, 5-ALA is a candidate as an oral antiviral drug for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Backgroundsaliva is established to contain high counts SARS-CoV-2 virus and contact with saliva droplets, contaminated surfaces or airborne particles are sources of viral transmission. The generation of infective aerosols during clinical procedures is of particular concern. Therefore, a fuller understanding of the potential of mouthwash to reduce viral counts and modulate the risk of transmission in medical professional and public context is an important research topic.\n\nMethodwe determined the virucidal activity of four anti-bacterial mouthwashes against a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2, Human CoV-SARS 229E, using a standard ASTM suspension test, with dilution and contact times applicable to recommended mouthwash use.\n\nResultsthe mouthwash formulated with 0.07% Cetylpyridinium Chloride exhibited virucidal effects providing a [&ge;]3.0 log reduction HCoV-229E viral count. Mouthwashes containing 15.7% ethanol, 0.2% zinc sulphate heptahydrate and a mix of enzymes and proteins did not demonstrate substantive virucidal activity in this test.\n\nConclusionmouthwash containing 0.07% Cetylpyridinium Chloride warrants further laboratory and clinical assessment to determine their potential benefit in reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nHighlightsSARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through contact with infective saliva.\n\nStudies are needed to understand if mouthwash can lower SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk.\n\n0.07% Cetylpyridinium Chloride (CPC) mouthwash exhibited virucidal effects against HCoV-SARS 229E.\n\nFurther studies on potential of 0.07% CPC mouthwash against SARS-CoV-2 are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third highly pathogenic coronavirus to spill over to humans in less than 20 years, after SARS-CoV-1 in 2002-2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV in 2012. SARS-CoV-2 is the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), which ranges from mild respiratory symptoms to severe lung injury and death in the most severe cases. The COVID-19 pandemic is currently a major health issue worldwide. Immune dysregulation characterized by altered innate cytokine responses is thought to contribute to the pathology of COVID-19 patients, which is a testimony of the fundamental role of the innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we further characterized the host cell antiviral response against SARS-CoV-2 by using primary human airway epithelia and immortalized model cell lines. We mainly focused on the type I and III interferon (IFN) responses, which lead to the establishment of an antiviral state through the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that both primary airway epithelial cells and model cell lines elicit a robust immune response characterized by a strong induction of type I and III IFN through the detection of viral pathogen molecular patterns (PAMPs) by melanoma differentiation associated gene (MDA)-5. However, despite the high levels of type I and III IFNs produced in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the IFN response was unable to control viral replication, whereas IFN pre-treatment strongly inhibited viral replication and de novo production of infectious virions. Taken together, these results highlight the complex and ambiguous interplay between viral replication and the timing of IFN responses.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesTo determine the extent and nature of changes in utilisation of healthcare services during COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDesignSystematic review\n\nEligibilityEligible studies compared utilisation of services during COVID-19 pandemic to at least one comparable period in prior years. Services included visits, admissions, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Studies were excluded if from single-centres or studied only COVID-19 patients.\n\nData sourcesPubMed, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and pre-prints were searched, without language restrictions, until August 10, using detailed searches with key concepts including COVID-19, health services and impact.\n\nData analysisRisk of bias was assessed by adapting ROBINS-I and Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care tool. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics, graphical figures, and narrative synthesis.\n\nOutcome measuresPrimary outcome was change in service utilisation between pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. Secondary outcome was the change in proportions of users of healthcare services with milder or more severe illness (e.g. triage scores).\n\nResults3097 unique references were identified, and 81 studies across 20 countries included, reporting on >11 million services pre-pandemic and 6.9 million during pandemic. For the primary outcome, there were 143 estimates of changes, with a median 37% reduction in services overall (interquartile range -51% to -20%), comprising median reductions for visits of 42%(-53% to -32%), admissions, 28%(-40% to -17%), diagnostics, 31%(-53% to -24%), and for therapeutics, 30%(-57% to -19%). Among 35 studies reporting secondary outcomes, there were 60 estimates, with 27(45%) reporting larger reductions in utilisation among people with a milder spectrum of illness, and 33 (55%) reporting no change.\n\nConclusionsHealthcare utilisation decreased by about a third during the pandemic, with considerable variation, and with greater reductions among people with less severe illness. While addressing unmet need remains a priority, studies of health impacts of reductions may help health-systems prioritise higher-value care in the post-pandemic recovery.\n\nFunding, Study registrationNo funding was required. PROSPERO: CRD42020203729\n\nStrengths and limitations of this study- The review is the first broad synthesis of global studies of pandemic related changes in utilisation across all categories of healthcare services.\n- The review provides novel findings informing design of future studies of pandemic-related changes in utilisation and its impacts.\n- Limitations include the possibility of publication bias and the potential of our eligibility criteria to exclude important data sources such as studies in single-centres and unpublished datasets from health systems.\n- Heterogenous designs and settings precluding meta-analysis.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe recovery of other respiratory viruses in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported, either at the time of a SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis (co-infection) or subsequently (superinfection). However, data on the prevalence, microbiology and outcomes of co-infection and super infection are limited. The purpose of this study was to examine occurrence of respiratory co-infections and superinfections and their outcomes among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nPatients and MethodsWe searched literature databases for studies published from October 1, 2019, through June 11, 2020. We included studies that reported clinical features and outcomes of co-infection or super-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. We followed PRISMA guidelines and we registered the protocol with PROSPERO as: CRD42020189763.\n\nResultsOf 1310 articles screened, 48 were included in the random effects meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of co-infection was 12% (95% confidence interval (CI): 6%-18%, n=29, I2=98%) and that of super-infection was 14% (95% CI: 9%-21%, n=18, I2=97%). Pooled prevalence of pathogen type stratified by co- or super-infection: viral co-infections, 4% (95% CI: 2%-7%); viral super-infections, 2% (95% CI: 0%-7%); bacterial co-infections, 4% (95% CI: 1%-8%); bacterial super-infections, 6% (95% CI: 2%-11%); fungal co-infections, 4% (95% CI: 1%-8%); and fungal super-infections, 4% (95% CI: 0%-11%). Compared to those with co-infections, patients with super-infections had a higher prevalence of mechanical ventilation [21% (95% CI: 13%-31%) vs. 7% (95% CI: 2%-15%)] and greater average length of hospital stay [mean=12.5 days, standard deviation (SD) =5.3 vs. mean=10.2 days, SD= 6.7].\n\nConclusionsOur study showed that as many as 14% of patients with COVID-19 have super-infections and 12% have co-infections. Poor outcomes were associated with super-infections. Our findings have implications for diagnostic testing and therapeutics, particularly in the upcoming respiratory virus season in the Northern Hemisphere.",

Ct values were independently lower in those reporting symptoms, with more genes detected, and in first (vs. subsequent) positives per-participant, with no evidence of independent effects of sex, ethnicity, age, deprivation or other test characteristics (p>0.20). Whilst single-gene positives without reported symptoms almost invariably had Ct>30, triple-gene positives without reported symptoms had widely varying Ct. Incorporating pre-test probability and Ct values, 1547(82%) and 112(6%) positives had \"higher\" or \"lower\" supporting evidence for genuine infection. Ct values, symptomatic percentages and supporting evidence changed over time. With lower positivity in the summer, there were proportionally more \"lower\" evidence positives, and \"higher\" evidence positives had higher Ct values (p<0.0001), suggesting lower viral burden. Declines in mean/median Ct values were apparent throughout August and preceded increases in positivity rates.\n\nConclusionsCommunity SARS-CoV-2 infections show marked variation in viral load. Ct values could be a useful epidemiological early-warning indicator.\n\nSUMMARYCycle threshold (Ct) values in community SARS-CoV-2 infections from national surveillance vary markedly, including over time and by symptoms (1892 (0.22%) positive nose and throat swabs, 843,851 tested). Ct values could be a useful epidemiological early warning indicator.",

    "abstract": "The clinical and scientific communities rely on serology testing to analyze the degree of antibody-mediated immunity afforded to recovered patients from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neutralizing antibodies present in COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) remains a practical therapy to treat COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization. However, it remains unclear how long antibody levels persist in CCP donors after recovery. An accurate estimation of antibody kinetics in CCP donors provide an important observation to further define the extent of long-term immunity in recovered patient and simultaneously inform CCP collection processes in efforts to improve CCP dosing and therapeutic outcome. In this study, we analyzed 63 donors and measured antibody levels using two high throughput screening assays (HTSA) designed to detect antibodies targeting the spike protein (S1) and nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 and monitored antibody levels between 2-8 consecutive donations. We show that anti-S1 antibody levels, as measured using the Ortho Total Ig HTSA, increased over time in repeat CCP donors while anti-NP antibody levels, as measured using the Abbott IgG HTSA, were unchanged or decreased over time. When we normalized these data, we found that both the absolute levels of anti-S1 antibodies and the ratio between S1 and NP antibodies tends to increase over time. These data have important implications for the convalescent donation process, patient protection from future infection and characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 immune response.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have had a particularly high impact on the health and wellbeing of people with pre-existing mental disorders. This may include higher than expected mortality rates due to severe infections themselves, due to other comorbidities, or through increased suicide rates during lockdown. However, there has been very little published information to date on causes of death in mental health service users. Taking advantage of a large mental healthcare database linked to death registrations, we describe numbers of deaths within specific underlying-cause-of-death groups for the period from 1st March to 30th June in 2020 and compare these with the same four-month periods in 2015-2019. In past and current service users, there were 2561 deaths in March-June 2020, compared to an average of 1452 for the same months in 2015-19: an excess of 1109. The 708 deaths with COVID-19 as the underlying cause in 2020 accounted for 63.8% of that excess. The remaining excess was accounted for by unnatural/unexplained deaths and by deaths recorded as due to neurodegenerative conditions, with no excess in those attributed to cancer, circulatory disorders, digestive disorders, respiratory disorders, or other disease codes. Of 295 unexplained deaths in 2020 with missing data on cause, 162 (54.9%) were awaiting a formal death notice (i.e. the group that included deaths awaiting a coroners inquest) - an excess of 129 compared to the average of previous years, accounting for 11.6% of the excess in total deaths.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDecisions regarding the continued need for control measures to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 rely on accurate and up-to-date information about the number of people and risk factors for testing positive. Existing surveillance systems are not based on population samples and are generally not longitudinal in design.\n\nMethodsFrom 26 April to 19 September2020, 514,794 samples from 123,497 individuals were collected from individuals aged 2 years and over from a representative sample of private households from England. Participants completed a questionnaire and nose and throat swab were taken. The percentage of individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was estimated over time using dynamic multilevel regression and post-stratification, to account for potential residual non-representativeness. Potential changes in risk factors for testing positive over time were also evaluated using multilevel regression models.\n\nFindingsBetween 26 April and 19 September 2020, in total, results were available from 514,794 samples from 123,497 individuals, of which 489 were positive overall from 398 individuals. The percentage of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 changed substantially over time, with an initial decrease between end of April and June, followed by low levels during the summer, before marked increases end of August and September 2020. Having a patient-facing role and working outside your home were important risk factors for testing positive in the first period but not (yet) in the second period of increased positivity rates, and age (young adults) being an important driver of the second period of increased positivity rates. A substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms (53%-70%, dependent on calendar time).\n\nInterpretationImportant risk factors for testing positive varied substantially between the initial and second periods of higher positivity rates, and a substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be important for managing the epidemic moving forwards.\n\nFundingThis study is funded by the Department of Health and Social Care.

Decisions regarding the continued need for social distancing measures in the overall population, specific subgroups and geographic areas heavily rely on accurate and up-to-date information about the number of people and risk factors for testing positive. We searched PubMed and medRxiv and bioRxiv preprint servers up to 6 June 2020 for epidemiological studies using the terms \"SARS-CoV-2\" and \"prevalence\" or \"incidence\" without data or language restrictions. Most studies were small or had only information about current presence of the virus for a small subset of patients, or used data not representative of the community, such as hospital admissions, deaths or self-reported symptoms. Large population-based studies, such as the current study, are required to understand risk factors and the dynamics of the epidemic.\n\nAdded value of this studyThis is the first longitudinal community survey of SARS-CoV-2 infection at national and regional levels in the UK. With more than 500,000 swabs from more than 120,000 individuals this study provides robust evidence that the percentage of individuals from the general community in England testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 clearly declined between end of April and June 2020,, followed by consistently low levels during the summer, before marked increases end of August and September 2020. Risk factors for testing positive varied substantially between the initial and second periods of higher positivity rates, with having a patient-facing role and working outside your home being important risk factors in the first period but not (yet) in the second period, and age (young adults) being an important driver of the second period of increased positivity rates. Positive tests commonly occurred without symptoms being reported.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceThe observed decline in the percentage of individuals testing positive adds to the increasing body of empirical evidence and theoretical models that suggest that the lockdown imposed on 23 March 2020 in England was associated, at least temporarily, with a decrease in infections. Important risk factors for testing positive varied substantially between the initial and second periods of higher positivity rates, and a substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be important for managing the epidemic moving forwards.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesThe recent COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted mental healthcare delivery, with many services shifting from in- person to remote patient contact. We investigated the impact of the pandemic on the use of remote consultation and on the prescribing of psychiatric medications.\n\nDesign and settingThe Clinical Record Interactive Search tool (CRIS) was used to examine de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of people receiving mental healthcare from the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) NHS Foundation Trust. Data from the period before and after the onset of the pandemic were analysed using linear regression, and visualised using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS).\n\nParticipantsAll patients receiving care from SLaM between 7th January 2019 and 20th September 2020 (around 37,500 patients per week).\n\nOutcome measuresO_LIThe number of clinical contacts (in-person, remote or non-attended) with mental healthcare professionals per week\nC_LIO_LIPrescribing of antipsychotic and mood stabiliser medications per week\nC_LI\n\nResultsFollowing the onset of the pandemic, the frequency of in-person contacts was significantly reduced compared to that in the previous year ({beta} coefficient: -5829.6 contacts, 95% CI -6919.5 to -4739.6, p<0.001), while the frequency of remote contacts significantly increased ({beta} coefficient: 3338.5 contacts, 95% CI 3074.4 to 3602.7, p<0.001). Rates of remote consultation were lower in older adults than in working age adults, children and adolescents. Despite this change in the type of patient contact, antipsychotic and mood stabiliser prescribing remained at similar levels.\n\nConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a marked increase in remote consultation, particularly among younger patients. However, there was no evidence that this has led to changes in psychiatric prescribing. Nevertheless, further work is needed to ensure that older patients are able to access mental healthcare remotely.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundsCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now recognized as a multi-system disease. The CDC recommends multiple preventive methods, including social distancing, hand hygiene, and wearing masks. In addition, some states imposed mandatory stay-at-home (SAH) and mandatory face mask (MFM) orders, to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to characterize the relationship between SAH and MFM approaches with the incidence and fatality. The research design is a cross-sectional study examining changes in incidence and fatality between states with and without SAH and MFM using available database from CDC during the pandemic periods of the date of the first positive case of each state to the date of 2020-08-23.\n\nResultsThe daily new cases curve of the nation was flattened under the order of SAH and increased following the end of SAH and several nation-wide social gathering events. There were similar incidence rates among SAH + MFM states (95% CI, 1.19% to 1.64%. n=34), SAH + no-MFM states (95% CI, 1.26% to 2.36%. n=9) and no-SAH + no-MFM (95% CI, 1.08% to 1.63%. n=7). However, SAH+MFM states (n=34), SAH+no-MFM states (n=9) had significantly higher averages in daily new cases and daily fatality, case-fatality-ratio (CFR) and mortality rate (per 100,000 residents) than no-SAH+no-MFM states during pandemic periods ({approx}171 days), respectively. When normalized to population density, beside higher CFR in no-SAH+no-MFM, there were no significant differences in total positive cases, average daily new cases and average daily fatality among the 3 groups during the pandemic periods. When comparing incidence during the period of SAH ({approx}45 days. n=43 states), there were significantly higher incidence rates and average daily new cases in MFM states (n=12) than in no-MFM states (n=31). When normalized to population density, there were no significant differences in total positive cases and average daily new cases between the 2 groups during the period of SAH.\n\nConclusionThis study provided direct evidence of a potential decreased in testing positivity rates, and a decreased fatality to save life when normalized by population density through strategies of SAH + MFM order during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, overall, our results were inconsistent with the intent of public health strategies of SAH and MFM in lowering transmission and fatality. From the policy making level, even if we cant strictly isolate contagious source patients in separate isolated places and without effective massive contact tracing, we presume that following the CDC recommendations with sufficient testing, could be appropriate to help in mitigate the COVID-19 disaster with close monitoring of healthcare capacity.",

    "abstract": "The UK enacted an intensive, nationwide lockdown on March 23 2020 to mitigate transmission of COVID-19. As restrictions began to ease, resurgence in transmission has been targeted by geographically-limited interventions of various stringencies. Determining the optimal spatial scale for local interventions is critical to ensure interventions reach the most at risk areas without unnecessarily restricting areas at low risk of resurgence. Here we use detailed human mobility data from Facebook to determine the spatially-explicit network community structure of the UK before and during the lockdown period, and how that has changed in response to the easing of restrictions and to locally-targeted interventions. We found that the mobility network became more sparse and the number of mobility communities decreased under the national lockdown. During this period, there was no evidence of re-routing in the network. Communities in which locally-targeted interventions have happened following resurgence did not show reorganization but did show small decreases in measurable mobility effects in the Facebook dataset. We propose that geographic communities detected in Facebook or other mobility data be part of decision making for determining the spatial extent or boundaries of interventions in the UK. These data are available in near real-time, and allow quantification of changes in the distribution of the population across the UK, as well as peoples travel patterns to give data-driven metrics for geographically-targeted interventions.\n\nSignificance StatementLarge-scale intensive interventions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have affected human movement patterns. Mobility data show spatially-explicit network structure, but it is not clear if that structure changed in response to national or locally-targeted interventions. We used daily Facebook for Good mobility data to quantify changes in the travel network in the UK during the national lockdown, and in response to local interventions. The network community structure inherent in these networks can help quantify which areas are at risk of resurgence, or the extent of locally-targeted interventions aiming to suppress transmission. We showed that spatial mobility data available in real-time can give information on connectivity that can be used to optimise the scale of geographically-targeted interventions.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDCOVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), became a pandemic in 2020 with mortality rate of 2% and high transmissibility, which makes studies with an epidemiological profile essential.\n\nOBJECTIVESTo characterize the population that performed the SARS-CoV-2 molecular and serological tests in Carlos Chagas-Sabin laboratories in Cuiaba.\n\nMETHODSA retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out with all the samples collected from nasal swab tested by RT-PCR and serological for SARM-CoV-2 IgM / IgG from the population served between April and July 2020.\n\nFINDINGSIn the analyzed period, 11,113 PCR-Covid-19 exams were registered. Of this total of cases, 3,912 (35.20%) tested positive, while 6,889 (61.90%) did not detect viral RNA and 312 (2.80%) of the visits resulted as undetermined. The peak of positive RT-PCR performed in July (n = 5878), with 35.65% (n = 2096). A total of 6,392 tests performed on SOROVID-19, with a peak of 1161 (18.16%) of the positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 in July.\n\nMAIN CONCLUSIONSMolecular positivity and serological tests, both peaked in July 2020, were mostly present in women aged 20-39, characterizing Cuiaba as the epicenter of the Midwest region in this period due to the high rate of transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "In Russia, COVID-19 has currently been growing hyper-exponentially. This type of a spread pattern was not seen during the first wave of the pandemic the world over. Indeed when the disease had first appeared, in the accelerating stage the spread pattern was observed to have followed a highly nonlinear pattern that could be said to be approximately exponential or sub-exponential. As to why in the resurgence the growth has become hyper-exponential is another matter. But this has been happening in Europe and how long this would continue cannot be predicted. It may so happen that in the countries in which retardation has already been taking place, there may be resurgence of the disease. It was observed that in the World as a whole, retardation was on the threshold during the second half of September. But if the resurgence happens to follow the hyper-exponential growth pattern in different countries, there may be resurgence in the World as a whole.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveIndoor mass gatherings in counties with high COVID-19 incidence have been linked to infections. We examined if outdoor mass gatherings in counties with low COVID-19 incidence are also followed by infections.\n\nMethodsWe retrospectively examined COVID-19 incidence in 20 counties that held mass gathering rallies (19 outdoor and 1 indoor) in the United States in August-September 2020. They were compared to the rest of the United States counties. We utilized a 7-day moving average and compared the change on the gathering date and 15 days later, based on the 95% confidence interval. For control counties we used the median of the gathering dates.\n\nSettingThe United States\n\nPopulation8.4 million in the counties holding mass gatherings, and 324 Million in the rest of the counties in the United States.\n\nMain Outcome MeasureChange in COVID-19 incidence rate per 100,000 capita during the two weeks following mass gatherings.\n\nResultsIn the two weeks following the gatherings, the COVID-19 incidence increased significantly in 14 of 20 counties. The county with the highest incidence increase (3.8-fold) had the 2nd lowest incidence before the gathering. The county with the highest decrease (0.4-fold) had the 3rd highest incidence before the gathering. At the gathering date, the average incidence of counties with gatherings was lower than the rest of the United States, and after the gathering, it increased 1.5-fold, while the rest of the United States increased 1.02-fold.\n\nConclusionThese results suggest that even outdoor gatherings in areas with low COVID-19 incidence are followed by increased infections, and that further precautions should be taken at such gatherings.\n\nWhat is already known on the topicMass gatherings have been linked to COVID-19 infections, but it is less clear how much it happens outdoors, and in areas with low incidence.\n\nWhat this study addsCOVID-19 infections increased significantly in 14 of 20 counties that held mass gathering rallies in the United States, 19 of which were outdoors. The county with the highest incidence increase (3.8-fold) was outdoors and had a low incidence before the gathering. The average incidence of all 20 counties with gatherings was lower at the gathering day compared with the rest of the United State, and it increased 1.5-fold following the gatherings. Our findings suggest a need for precautions in mass gatherings, even when outdoors and in areas with a low incidence of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the utility of widespread molecular testing for surveillance and diagnostic detection of SARS-CoV-2. Reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) has enabled testing outside of the standard clinical laboratory PCR infrastructure, with simple and rapid tests supplementing the existing, standard methods. However, current LAMP tests have detected single targets and required separate reactions for controls or multiple targets. As flu season arrives in the Northern Hemisphere the ability to screen for multiple viral targets will be increasingly important, and the ability to include internal control assays in the RT-LAMP test allows for decreased resource use and increased throughput. Here we describe a multiplexing approach to RT-LAMP with four targets (SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A, Influenza B, and internal control human RNA) in a single reaction using real-time and endpoint fluorescence detection. This increase to the functionality of RT-LAMP will, we hope, enable even broader adoption of this power molecular testing approach to aid in the global fight against this continuing public health threat.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe prevalence and persistence of antibodies following a peak SARS-CoV-2 infection provides insights into its spread in the community, the likelihood of reinfection and potential for some level of population immunity.\n\nMethodsPrevalence of antibody positivity in England, UK (REACT2) with three cross-sectional surveys between late June and September 2020. 365104 adults used a self-administered lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test for IgG. A laboratory comparison of LFIA results to neutralization activity in panel of sera was performed.\n\nResultsThere were 17,576 positive tests over the three rounds. Antibody prevalence, adjusted for test characteristics and weighted to the adult population of England, declined from 6.0% [5.8, 6.1], to 4.8% [4.7, 5.0] and 4.4% [4.3, 4.5], a fall of 26.5% [-29.0, -23.8] over the three months of the study. There was a decline between rounds 1 and 3 in all age groups, with the highest prevalence of a positive result and smallest overall decline in positivity in the youngest age group (18-24 years: -14.9% [-21.6, -8.1]), and lowest prevalence and largest decline in the oldest group (75+ years: -39.0% [-50.8, -27.2]); there was no change in antibody positivity between rounds 1 and 3 in healthcare workers (+3.45% [-5.7, +12.7]).\n\nThe decline from rounds 1 to 3 was largest in those who did not report a history of COVID-19, (-64.0% [-75.6, -52.3]), compared to -22.3% ([-27.0, -17.7]) in those with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed on PCR.\n\nDiscussionThese findings provide evidence of variable waning in antibody positivity over time such that, at the start of the second wave of infection in England, only 4.4% of adults had detectable IgG antibodies using an LFIA. Antibody positivity was greater in those who reported a positive PCR and lower in older people and those with asymptomatic infection. These data suggest the possibility of decreasing population immunity and increasing risk of reinfection as detectable antibodies decline in the population.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has disproportionately affected older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions. Research has focused on short-term outcomes in hospital, and single organ involvement. Consequently, impact of long COVID (persistent symptoms three months post-infection) across multiple organs in low-risk individuals is yet to be assessed.\n\nMethodsAn ongoing prospective, longitudinal, two-centre, observational study was performed in individuals symptomatic after recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Symptoms and organ function (heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, spleen) were assessed by standardised questionnaires (EQ-5D-5L, Dyspnoea-12), blood investigations and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, defining single and multi-organ impairment by consensus definitions.\n\nFindingsBetween April and September 2020, 201 individuals (mean age 44 (SD 11.0) years, 70% female, 87% white, 31% healthcare workers) completed assessments following SARS-CoV-2 infection (median 140, IQR 105-160 days after initial symptoms). The prevalence of pre-existing conditions (obesity: 20%, hypertension: 6%; diabetes: 2%; heart disease: 4%) was low, and only 18% of individuals had been hospitalised with COVID-19. Fatigue (98%), muscle aches (88%), breathlessness (87%), and headaches (83%) were the most frequently reported symptoms. Ongoing cardiorespiratory (92%) and gastrointestinal (73%) symptoms were common, and 42% of individuals had ten or more symptoms.\n\nThere was evidence of mild organ impairment in heart (32%), lungs (33%), kidneys (12%), liver (10%), pancreas (17%), and spleen (6%). Single (66%) and multi-organ (25%) impairment was observed, and was significantly associated with risk of prior COVID-19 hospitalisation (p<0.05).\n\nInterpretationIn a young, low-risk population with ongoing symptoms, almost 70% of individuals have impairment in one or more organs four months after initial symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are implications not only for burden of long COVID but also public health approaches which have assumed low risk in young people with no comorbidities.\n\nFundingThis work was supported by the UKs National Consortium of Intelligent Medical Imaging through the Industry Strategy Challenge Fund, Innovate UK Grant 104688, and also through the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 719445.",

Here we report results from the fifth round of observations for swabs collected from the 18th September to 5th October 2020. This report updates and should be read alongside our round 5 interim report.\n\nMethodsRepresentative samples of the population aged 5 years and over in England with sample size ranging from 120,000 to 175,000 people at each round. Prevalence of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, estimation of reproduction number (R) and time trends between and within rounds using exponential growth or decay models.\n\nResults175,000 volunteers tested across England between 18th September and 5th October. Findings show a national prevalence of 0.60% (95% confidence interval 0.55%, 0.71%) and doubling of the virus every 29 (17, 84) days in England corresponding to an estimated national R of 1.16 (1.05, 1.27). These results correspond to 1 in 170 people currently swab-positive for the virus and approximately 45,000 new infections each day. At regional level, the highest prevalence is in the North West, Yorkshire and The Humber and the North East with strongest regional growth in North West, Yorkshire and The Humber and West Midlands.\n\nConclusionRapid growth has led to high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in England, with highest rates in the North of England. Prevalence has increased in all age groups, including those at highest risk. Improved compliance with existing policy and, as necessary, additional interventions are required to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community and limit the numbers of hospital admissions and deaths from COVID-19.",

SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was estimated to be 8.74% (95% CI: 2.34%-18.53%) among students, compared to 13.68% (95% CI: 1.68%-33.89%) among school staff. Gender differences were not found for secondary infection (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 0.50-4.14, P= 0.49) and SARS-CoV-2 positivity (OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.72-1.13, P= 0.36) in schools. Fever, cough, dyspnea, ageusia, anosmia, rhinitis, sore throat, headache, myalgia, asthenia, and diarrhoea were all associated with the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (based on two studies). Overall, study quality was judged to be poor with risk of performance and attrition bias, limiting the confidence in the results.\n\nConclusionsThere is limited high-quality evidence available to quantify the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools or to compare it to community transmission. Emerging evidence suggests lower IAR and SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate in students compared to school staff. Future prospective and adequately controlled cohort studies are necessary to confirm this finding.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic in the UK has been characterised by periods of exponential growth and decline, as different non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are brought into play. During the early uncontrolled phase of the outbreak (early March 2020) there was a period of prolonged exponential growth with epidemiological observations such as hospitalisation doubling every 3-4 days (growth rate r {approx} 0.2). The enforcement of strict lockdown measures led to a noticeable decline in all epidemic quantities (r {approx} -0.06) that slowed during the summer as control measures were relaxed (r {approx} -0.02). Since August, infections, hospitalisations and deaths have been rising (precise estimation of the current growth rate is difficult due to extreme regional heterogeneity and temporal lags between the different epidemiological observations) and various NPIs have been applied locally throughout the UK in response.\n\nControlling any rise in infection is a compromise between public health and societal costs, with more stringent NPIs reducing cases but damaging the economy and restricting freedoms. Currently, NPI imposition is made in response to the epidemiological state, are of indefinite length and are often imposed at short notice, greatly increasing the negative impact. An alternative approach is to consider planned, limited duration periods of strict NPIs aiming to purposefully reduce prevalence before such emergency NPIs are required. These \"precautionary breaks\" may offer a means of keeping control of the epidemic, while their fixed duration and the forewarning may limit their society impact. Here, using simple analysis and age-structured models matched to the unfolding UK epidemic, we investigate the action of precautionary breaks. In particular we consider their impact on the prevalence of infection, as well as the total number of predicted hospitalisations and deaths. We find that precautionary breaks provide the biggest gains when the growth rate is low, but offer a much needed brake on increasing infection when the growth rate is higher, potentially allowing other measures (such as contact tracing) to regain control.",

    "abstract": "This study applied causal criteria in directed acyclic graphs for handling covariates in associations for prognosis of severe COVID-19 (Corona virus disease 19) cases. To identify nonspecific blood tests and risk factors as predictors of hospitalization due to COVID-19, one has to exclude noisy predictors by comparing the concordance statistics (AUC) for positive and negative cases of SARS-CoV-2 (acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Predictors with significant AUC at negative stratum should be either controlled for their confounders or eliminated (when confounders are unavailable). Models were classified according to the difference of AUC between strata. The framework was applied to an open database with 5644 patients from Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Brazil with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction) exam. C-reactive Protein (CRP) was a noisy predictor: hospitalization could have happen due to causes other than COVID-19 even when SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR is positive and CRP is reactive, as most cases are asymptomatic to mild. Candidates of characteristic response from moderate to severe inflammation of COVID-19 were: combinations of eosinophils, monocytes and neutrophils, with age as risk factor; and creatinine, as risk factor, sharpens the odds ratio of the model with monocytes, neutrophils, and age.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionCOVID-19 outbreak has imposed an eight-week confinement in France. During this period, children and their families were exposed to a full-time home life. The aim of this study was to assess the emotional experience and tolerance of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in this particular context.\n\nMethodA clinical survey was proposed to parents and rated by professionals once a week during the quarantine period in France. 95 autistic children followed by the child and adolescent psychiatry department of Tours university hospital were assessed from the 18th of March to the 8th of May. The following clinical points were investigated: child anxiety, family anxiety, behavior problems, impact on sleep, impact on appetite, impact on school work, family tension, confinement intolerance, difficulties to follow a schedule, isolation behavior.\n\nResultsDespite minor changes in family anxiety and school work, no difference was highlighted between clinical scores collected at the beginning and at the end of this period. ASD children with or without intellectual disability had non-significant clinical changes during quarantine. This evolution was also independent of the accommodation type (house or apartment) and the parental status (relationship, separated or isolated).\n\nConclusionThe sameness dimension in autism and parents adaptation may be involved in this clinical stability during COVID confinement. Moreover, specialized tools and support provided by professionals could have participated to these outcomes and must be regularly promoted in order to help families in this still difficult period.",

    "abstract": "The lockdown and social distancing policy imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have had a widespread impact on mental healthcare service provision and use. Previous reports from the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in South London) highlighted a shift to virtual contacts among those accessing community mental health and home treatment teams and an increase in deaths over the pandemics first wave. However, there is a need to quantify this for individuals with particular vulnerabilities, including those with learning disabilities and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Taking advantage of the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource with 24-hourly updates of electronic mental health records data, this paper describes daily caseloads and contact numbers (face-to-face and virtual) for individuals with potential neurodevelopmental disorders across community, specialist, crisis and inpatient services. The report focussed on the period 1st January to 31st July 2020. We also report on daily accepted and discharged trust referrals, total trust caseloads and daily inpatient admissions and discharges for individuals with potential neurodevelopmental disorders. In addition, daily deaths are described for all current and previous SLaM service users with potential neurodevelopmental disorders over this period. In summary, comparing periods before and after 16th March 2020 there was a shift from face-to-face contacts to virtual contacts across all teams. The largest declines in caseloads and total contacts were seen in Home Treatment Team, Liaison/A&E and Older Adult teams. Reduced accepted referrals and inpatient admissions were observed and there was an 103% increase in average daily deaths in the period after 16th March, compared to the period 1st January to 15th March (or a 282% increase if the 2-month period from 16th March to 15th May was considered alone).",

    "abstract": "Prognostic models to predict the risk of clinical deterioration in acute COVID-19 are required to inform clinical management decisions. Among 75,016 consecutive adults across England, Scotland and Wales prospectively recruited to the ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium (ISARIC4C) study, we developed and validated a multivariable logistic regression model for in-hospital clinical deterioration (defined as any requirement of ventilatory support or critical care, or death) using 11 routinely measured variables. We used internal-external cross-validation to show consistent measures of discrimination, calibration and clinical utility across eight geographical regions. We further validated the final model in held-out data from 8,252 individuals in London, with similarly consistent performance (C-statistic 0.77 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.78); calibration-in-the-large 0.01 (-0.04 to 0.06); calibration slope 0.96 (0.90 to 1.02)). Importantly, this model demonstrated higher net benefit than using other candidate scores to inform decision-making. Our 4C Deterioration model thus demonstrates unprecedented clinical utility and generalisability to predict clinical deterioration among adults hospitalised with COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Airborne spread of COVID-19 by infectious aerosol is all but certain. However, easily implemented approaches to assess the actual environmental threat are currently unavailable. We present a simple approach with the potential to rapidly provide information about the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the atmosphere at any location. We used a portable dehumidifier as a readily available and affordable tool to collect airborne virus in the condensate. The dehumidifiers were deployed in selected locations of a hospital ward with patients reporting flu like symptoms which could possibly be due to COVID-19 over three separate periods of one week. Samples were analyzed frequently for both virus envelope protein and SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In several samples across separate deployments, condensate from dehumidifiers tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens and confirmed using two independent assays. RNA was detected, but not attributable to SARS-CoV-2. Our results point to a facile pool testing method to sample air in any location in the world and assess the presence and concentration of the infectious agent in order to obtain quantitative risk assessment of exposure, designate zones as  hot spots and minimize the need for individual testing which may often be time consuming, expensive and laborious.",

    "abstract": "Covid-19 is a pandemic which has affected all parts of the world. Covid-19 is a pandemic which can be controlled only by maintaining social distancing, proper hygiene, wearing mask, hand sanitation and to a extend by wearing face shield. Even though each state has followed their own ways of controlling the infection, awareness among citizens and behaving as responsible citizens is very important in controlling this disease. Contact tracing plays an important role in controlling this pandemic. This paper deals with the effect of Covid-19 in various states of India and also forecasts its effect using machine learning techniques. Regression analysis like Linear and polynomial have been used for analysis of Covid-19, where Kaggle dataset has been used. This helps in understanding the much-affected states in India and helps to understand the infrastructure requirements to handle this pandemic efficiently.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has hit different parts of the world differently: some regions are still in the rise of the first wave, other regions are now facing a decline after a first wave, and yet other regions have started to see a second wave. The current immunity level i in a region is closely related to the cumulative fraction infected, which primarily depends on two factors: a) the initial potential for COVID-19 in the region (often quantified by the basic reproduction number R0), and b) the timing, amount and effectiveness of preventive measures put in place. By means of a mathematical model including heterogeneities owing to age, social activity and susceptibility, and allowing for time-varying preventive measures, the risk for a new epidemic wave and its doubling time, and how they depend on R0, i and the overall effect of the current preventive measures, are investigated. Focus lies on quantifying the minimal overall effect of preventive measures pMin needed to prevent a future outbreak. The first result shows that the current immunity level i plays a more influential roll than when immunity is obtained from vaccination. Secondly, by comparing regions with different R0 and i it is shown that regions with lower R0 and low i may now need higher preventive measures (pMin) compared with other regions having higher R0 but also higher i, even when such immunity levels are far from herd immunity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundStudies show that having some symptoms seems to be associated with more severe disease and poor prognosis. Therefore, knowing who is more susceptible to symptomatic COVID-19 disease is important to provide targeted preventive and management practice. The aim of the study was to assess the determinants of having symptomatic disease among COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia.\n\nMethodsA case-control study was conducted from August to September 2020 among a randomly selected 765 COVID-19 patients (372 Asymptomatic and 393 Symptomatic patients). Chi-square test and independent t-test were used to detect the presence of a statistically significant difference in the characteristics of the cases (symptomatic) and controls (asymptomatic), where p-value of <0.05 considered as having a statistically significant difference. Multivariable binary logistic regression was used to assess a statistically significant association between the independent variables and developing symptomatic COVID-19 where Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR), 95% CIs for AOR, and P-values were used for testing significance and interpretation of results.\n\nResultsThe result of the multivariable binary logistic regression shows that age group (AOR= 1.818, 95% CI= 1.210, 2.731, p-value=0.004 for 30-39 years; AOR= 1.611, 95% CI= 1.016, 2.554, p-value=0.043 for 40-49 years and AOR= 4.076, 95% CI= 2.582, 6.435, p-value=0.0001 for years and above), sex (AOR= 1.672, 95% CI= 1.216, 2.299, p-value=0.002) and history of diabetes mellitus (AOR= 2.406, 95% CI= 1.384, 4.181, p-value=0.002) were found to be significant factors that determine the development of symptomatic disease in COVID-19 patients.\n\nConclusionsDeveloping a symptomatic COVID-19 disease was found to be determined by exposures of old age, male sex, and being diabetic. Therefore, patients with the above factors should be given enough attention in the prevention and management process, including inpatient management, to pick symptoms earlier and to manage accordingly so that these patients can have a favorable treatment outcome.",

    "abstract": "This study uses mobility statistics--a relatively novel data source consisting of smartphone location data--combined with business census data for the eight Japanese prefectures with the highest COVID-19 infection rates to study the effect of lockdown measures on the effective transmission rate of the virus. Based on data for the first wave of infections in Japan, we found that reductions targeting the hospitality industry were more effective than restrictions on general business activities. Specifically, we found that to fully converge the pandemic (that is, to reduce the effective reproduction number to one or less for all the days), a 40-67% reduction in weekly mobility is required, depending on the region. A lesser goal, 80% of days with one or less observed transmission, a 14-61% reduction in weekly mobility is needed.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding determinants of developing severe COVID-19 disease is important as studies show that severe disease is associated with worse outcomes.\n\nObjectiveThe study aimed to assess the determinants of COVID-19 disease severity among COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia.\n\nMethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted from June to August 2020 among randomly selected 686 patients. Chi-square test was used to detect the presence of a statistically significant difference in the characteristics of the patients based on disease severity (Mild Vs Moderate Vs Severe), where p-value of <0.05 was considered as having a statistically significant difference. A Multivariable multinomial logistic regression model was used to assess the presence of a significant association between the independent variables and COVID-19 disease severity where Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR), 95% CIs for AOR and P-values were used for testing significance and interpretation of results.\n\nResultsHaving moderate as compared with mild disease was significantly associated with having hypertension (AOR= 2.302, 95% CI= 1.266, 4.184, p-value=0.006), diabetes mellitus (AOR=2.607, 95% CI= 1.307, 5.198, p-value=0.007 for diabetes mellitus), fever (AOR= 6.115, 95% CI= 2.941, 12.716, p-value=0.0001) and headache (AOR= 2.695, 95% CI= 1.392, 5.215, p-value=0.003). Similarly, having severe disease as compared with mild disease was associated with age group (AOR= 4.428, 95% CI= 2.497, 7.853, p-value=0.0001 for 40-59 years and AOR=18.070, 95% CI=9.292, 35.140, p-value=0.0001 for [&ge;] 60 years), sex (AOR=1.842, 95% CI=1.121, 3.027, p-value=0.016), hypertension (AOR= 1.966, 95% CI= 1.076, 3.593, p-value=0.028), diabetes mellitus (AOR= 3.926, 95% CI= 1.964, 7.847, p-value=0.0001), fever (AOR= 13.218, 95% CI= 6.109, 28.601, p-value=0.0001) and headache (AOR= 4.816, 95% CI= 2.324, 9.979, p-value=0.0001). In addition, determinants of severe disease as compared with moderate disease were found to be age group (AOR= 4.871, 95% CI= 2.854, 8.315, p-value=0.0001 for 40-59 years and AOR= 18.906, 95% CI= 9.838, 36.334, p-value=0.0001 for [&ge;] 60 years), fever (AOR= 2.161, 95% CI= 1.286, 3.634, p-value=0.004) and headache (AOR= 1.787, 95% CI= 1.028, 3.107, p-value=0.039).\n\nConclusionsBeing old, male sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and having symptoms of fever and headache were found to be determinants of developing a more severe COVID-19 disease category. We recommend a better preventive practice to be set in place so that these groups of patients can be protected from acquiring the disease. And for those who are already infected, a more careful follow-up and management should be given so that complication and death can be prevented. Furthermore, considering the above non respiratory symptoms as disease severity indicator could be important.",

    "abstract": "Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the primary method used for the detection and diagnosis of infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since SARS-CoV-2s entrance into the United States, numerous clinical laboratories and in vitro diagnostic companies have developed rRT-PCR assays, some requiring specialized materials and reagents. One such assay includes the cobas(R) SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative Assay for use on the cobas(R) 6800/8800 (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.). Since initiation of this assay at our facility, our ability to run testing at full capacity has been limited due to restricted supply of the omni cobas(R) Processing Plate (Product Number 05534917001), a 96 deep well plate used for all sample processing and total nucleic acid extraction via MagNA Pure magnetic beads. To work around this limiting factor, we have successfully designed and tested a cleaning protocol utilizing the widely available laboratory resources of bleach, ethyl-alcohol and autoclaving, for omni cobas(R) Processing Plate re-use.",

    "abstract": "The transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) becomes pandemic but presents different patterns in the world. To describe the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in each country or region, mathematical models were formulated aiming the estimation of the basic reproduction number R0. The simplest mathematical model, the SIR model, provided a lower estimation for R0, ranging from 1.5 to 3.0. However, more elaborate models, taking into account the natural history of covid-19, must be used to obtain a more reliable estimation of R0. One of the elaborated models presented here estimated a higher value for R0, that is, 6.54 and 5.88 for, respectively, Sao Paulo State (Brazil) and Spain. It is worth stressing that this model assumed that severe covid-19 cases were not participating in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission chain, which can not be assumed in the SIR model.",

    "abstract": "Virologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 has been central to the COVID-19 pandemic response, but interpreting changes in incidence and fraction of positive tests towards understanding the epidemic trajectory is confounded by changes in testing practices. Here, we show that the distribution of viral loads, in the form of Cycle thresholds (Ct), from positive surveillance samples at a single point in time can provide accurate estimation of an epidemics trajectory, subverting the need for repeated case count measurements which are frequently obscured by changes in testing capacity. We identify a relationship between the population-level cross-sectional distribution of Ct values and the growth rate of the epidemic, demonstrating how the skewness and median of detectable Ct values change purely as a mathematical epidemiologic rule without any change in individual level viral load kinetics or testing. Although at the individual level measurement variation can complicate interpretation of Ct values for clinical use, we show that population-level properties reflect underlying epidemic dynamics. In support of these theoretical findings, we observe a strong relationship between the time-varying effective reproductive number, R(t), and the distribution of Cts among positive surveillance specimens, including median and skewness, measured in Massachusetts over time. We use the observed relationships to derive a novel method that allows accurate inference of epidemic growth rate using the distribution of Ct values observed at a single cross-section in time, which, unlike estimates based on case counts, is less susceptible to biases from delays in test results and from changing testing practices. Our findings suggest that instead of discarding individual Ct values from positive specimens, incorporation of viral loads into public health data streams offers a new approach for real-time resource allocation and assessment of outbreak mitigation strategies, even where repeat incidence data is not available. Ct values or similar viral load data should be regularly reported to public health officials by testing centers and incorporated into monitoring programs.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic, is evolving into different genetic variants by accumulating mutations as it spreads globally. In addition to this diversity of consensus genomes across patients, RNA viruses can also display genetic diversity within individual hosts, and co-existing viral variants may affect disease progression and the success of medical interventions. To systematically examine the intra-patient genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2, we processed a large cohort of 3939 publicly-available deeply sequenced genomes with specialised bioinformatics software, along with 749 recently sequenced samples from Switzerland. We found that the distribution of diversity across patients and across genomic loci is very unbalanced with a minority of hosts and positions accounting for much of the diversity. For example, the D614G variant in the Spike gene, which is present in the consensus sequences of 67.4% of patients, is also highly diverse within hosts, with 29.7% of the public cohort being affected by this coexistence and exhibiting different variants. We also investigated the impact of several technical and epidemiological parameters on genetic heterogeneity and found that age, which is known to be correlated with poor disease outcomes, is a significant predictor of viral genetic diversity.\n\nAuthor SummarySince it arose in late 2019, the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) behind the COVID-19 pandemic has mutated and evolved during its global spread. Individual patients may host different versions, or variants, of the virus, hallmarked by different mutations. We examine the diversity of genetic variants coexisting within patients across a cohort of 3939 publicly accessible samples and 749 recently sequenced samples from Switzerland. We find that a small number of patients carry most of the diversity, and that patients with more diversity tend to be older. We also find that most of the diversity is concentrated in certain regions and positions of the virus genome. In particular, we find that a variant reported to increase infectivity is among the most diverse positions. Our study provides a large-scale survey of within-patient diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 genome.",

    "abstract": "AimTo estimate time to recovery/convalescence and identify determinants among COVID-19 infected patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n\nMethodsA prospective cohort study was conducted among a randomly selected sample of 360 COVID-19 patients who were on follow up from 2nd June to 5th July 2020. Kaplan Meier plots, median survival times, and Log-rank test were used to describe the data and compare survival distribution between groups. Association between time to recovery/ convalescence and determinants was assessed using the Cox proportional hazard survival model, where hazard ratio, P-value, and 95% CI for hazard ratio were used for testing significance.\n\nResultsThe mean age of the participants was 32.4 years ({+/-} 12.5 years). On admission, 86.9 % had mild COVID-19, 78.6% were asymptomatic and 11.4% of the patients had a history of pre-existing co-morbid illness. The Median time to recovery/ convalescence among the study population was 16 days. The log-rank test shows that having non-mild (moderate and severe) disease, having one or more symptoms at presentation, and presenting with respiratory and constitutional symptoms seems to extend the time needed to achieve recovery. The Final Cox regression result shows that the presence of symptom at presentation was found to be a significant factor that affects time to recovery/ convalescence, the rate of achieving recovery/ convalescence among symptomatic patients was 44% lower than patients who were asymptomatic at presentation (HR= 0.560, 95% CI= 0.322-0.975, p-value=0.040).\n\nConclusionsPresence of symptom was found to be associated with delayed viral clearance. This implies symptomatic patients are more likely to be infectious because of the prolonged viral shedding in addition to the presence of a more concentrated virus in the upper respiratory tract that enhances the transmission. Therefore, attention should be given in the isolation and treatment practice of COVID-19 patients with regard to presence of symptom.\n\nKey MessagesO_LIThe study assessed the time to RT-PCR proven recovery (two consecutive negative viral shedding) and identified determinants that affected the time.\nC_LIO_LISymptomatic infection is associated with delayed viral clearance.\nC_LIO_LIThe finding of the study could be used to guide the isolation and treatment practice.\nC_LI",

Diagnostic accuracy was calculated as 86.7% and 84% for DESI and LD-REIMS respectively. Results can be acquired in seconds providing robust and quick analysis of COVID-19 status which could be carried out without the need for a centralised laboratory. This technology has the potential to provide an alternative to population testing and enable the track and trace objectives set by governments and curtail the effects of a second surge in COVID-19 positive cases.

    "abstract": "Early school closures were a consistent, nationwide response to the COVID-19 pandemic in mid-March due to the role that children play in spreading influenza. This left us with limited understanding of COVID-19 transmission in children until several states reopened schools for the 2020-2021 school year. While early school closures were likely beneficial in protecting children in the initial stages of the pandemic in the U.S., long-term closures pose significant cumulative effects in children who rely on schools for instruction and additional social services, and for parents who need to balance work and childcare obligations. Reopening schools safely is a high priority for many interested stakeholders.\n\nProposed in-person school reopening plans include traditional, 100% school capacity, five days per week instruction, hybrid scenarios with reduced in-person instruction and virtual learning, and various reduced school capacity schedules with non-pharmaceutical interventions in place. To assess the potential impacts of different reopening plans, we created a modified SIR-type transmission model that captures multiple known pathways of COVID-19 transmission in a 100,000-person community.\n\nOur results show that plans that utilize consecutive days in school and divide students into separated smaller cohorts who attend school together, as well as plans that emphasize distance learning, are better able to suppress disease spread and reduce risk from an introduced infective into the community. Plans with more consecutive school days are protective for both the schoolchildren and surrounding community by acting to separate the larger intermixing population into smaller intermixing subpopulations. The \"Five-Day Switch\" plan, which separates students into two cohorts, each of whom attend in-person learning for five consecutive days followed by five days of distance learning, best captures these protective attributes. All modeled plans assumed initially disease-free communities and that childrens interactions with the community are greatly reduced during instructional days, both for in-person and distance learning.",

    "abstract": "Studies estimate that a substantial proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs through individuals who do not exhibit symptoms. Mitigation strategies test only those who are moderately to severely symptomatic, excluding the substantial portion of cases that are asymptomatic yet still infectious and likely responsible for a large proportion of the virus spread (1-8). While isolating asymptomatic cases will be necessary to effectively control viral spread, these cases are functionally invisible and there is no current method to identify them for isolation. To address this major omission in COVID-19 control, we develop a strategy, Sampling-Testing-Quarantine (STQ), for identifying and isolating individuals with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in order to mitigate the epidemic. STQ uses probability sampling in the general population, regardless of symptoms, then isolates the individuals who test positive along with their household members who are high probability for asymptomatic infections. To test the potential efficacy of STQ, we use an agent-based model, designed to computationally simulate the epidemic in the Seattle with infection parameters, like R0 and asymptomatic fraction, derived from population data. Our results suggest that STQ can substantially slow and decrease the spread of COVID-19, even in the absence of school and work shutdowns. Results also recommend which sampling techniques, frequency of implementation, and population subject to isolation are most efficient in reducing spread with limited numbers of tests.\n\nSignificance StatementA substantial portion of SARS-CoV-2 infections are spread through asymptomatic carriers. Until a vaccine is developed, research indicates an urgent need to identify these asymptomatic infections to control COVID-19, but there is currently no effective strategy to do so. In this study, we develop such a strategy, a procedure called Sampling-Testing-Quarantine (STQ), that combines techniques from survey methods for sampling from the general population and testing and isolation techniques from epidemiology. With computational simulations, we demonstrate that STQ procedures can dramatically decrease and slow COVID-19 spread, even in the absence of widespread work, school, and community lockdowns. We also find particular implementation strategies (including sampling techniques, frequencies of implementation, and people who are subject to isolation) are most efficient in mitigating spread.",

    "abstract": "Due to the rapid increase of COVID-19 infection cases in many countries such as the Philippines, many efforts in forecasting the daily infections have been made in order to better manage the pandemic, and respond effectively. In this study, we consider the cumulative COVID-19 infection cases in the Philippines from March 6 to July 31,2020 and forecast the cases from August 1 - 15, 2020 using various mathematical models --weighted moving average, exponential smoothing, Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, and random forest. We then compare the results to the actual data using traditional error metrics. Our results show that the ARIMA(1,2,1) model has the closest forecast values to the actual data. Policymakers can use our result in determining which forecast method to use for their community in order to have a data-based information for the preparation of their personnel and facilities.",

    "abstract": "Accurate estimates of the prevalence of infection are essential for evaluating and informing public health responses to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the United States (US), but reliable, timely prevalence data based on representative population sampling are unavailable, and reported case and test positivity rates may provide strongly biased estimates. A single parameter semi-empirical model was developed, calibrated, and validated with prevalence predictions from two independent data-driven mathematical epidemiological models, each of which was separately validated using available cumulative infection estimates from recent state-wide serological testing in 6 states. The analysis shows that individually, reported case rates and test positivity rates may provide substantially biased estimates of COVID-19 prevalence and transmission trends in the U.S. However, the COVID-19 prevalence for U.S. states from March-July, 2020 is well approximated, with a 7-day lag, by the geometric mean of reported case and test positivity rates averaged over the previous 14 days. Predictions of this semi-empirical model are at least 10-fold more accurate than either test positivity or reported case rates alone, with accuracy that remains relatively constant across different US states and varying testing rates. The use of this simple and readily-available surrogate metric for COVID-19 prevalence, that is more accurate than test positivity and reported case rates and does not rely on mathematical modeling, may provide more reliable information for decision makers to make effective state-level decisions as to public health responses to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the US.",

    "abstract": "While general lockdowns have proven effective to control SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, they come with enormous costs for society. It is therefore essential to identify control strategies with lower social and economic impact. Here, we report and evaluate the control strategy implemented during a large SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in June-July 2020 in French Guiana that relied on curfews, targeted lockdowns and other measures. We find that the combination of these interventions reduced the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 from 1.7 to 1.1, which was sufficient to avoid saturation of hospitals. We estimate that thanks to the young demographics across the territory, the risk of hospitalisation following infection was 0.3 times that of metropolitan France and that about 20% of the population was infected by July. Our model projections are consistent with a recent seroprevalence study. The study showcases how mathematical modeling can be used to support healthcare planning and decision making in a context of high uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "T-cell immunity is likely to play a role in protection against SARS-CoV-2 by helping generate neutralizing antibodies. We longitudinally studied CD4 T-cell responses to the M, N, and S structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in 21 convalescent individuals. Within the first two months following symptom onset, a majority of individuals (81%) mount at least one CD4 T-cell response, and 48% of individuals mount detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific peripheral T follicular helper cells (pTfh, defined as CXCR5+PD1+ CD4 T cells). SARS-CoV-2-specific pTfh responses across all three protein specificities correlate with antibody neutralization with the strongest correlation observed for S protein-specific responses. When examined over time, pTfh responses increase in frequency and magnitude in convalescence, and robust responses with magnitudes greater than 5% were detected only at the second convalescent visit, an average of 38 days post-symptom onset. These data deepen our understanding of antigen-specific pTfh responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that M and N protein-specific pTfh may also assist in the development of neutralizing antibodies and that pTfh response formation may be delayed in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nAuthor SummarySince December 2019, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Most currently licensed vaccines are understood to protect against infection by inducing neutralizing antibodies. As such, ongoing COVID-19 vaccine trials have focused on antibody neutralization as a primary immunologic endpoint. It is well established that T follicular helper cells are essential to the development of neutralizing antibodies and that a subset of these cells, peripheral T follicular helper cells (pTfh), can be studied in the blood. However, little is known about Tfh responses mounted in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we studied pTfh to three major structural proteins in individuals recovered from COVID-19. We find that SARS-CoV-2-specific pTfh frequencies correlate with neutralizing antibody responses, especially those directed against the spike protein. We also find that pTfh responses to SARS-CoV-2 increase over time. Our findings suggest that pTfh responses against proteins other than the spike protein may contribute to the development of neutralizing antibodies and suggests that formation of pTfh responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection may be delayed.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has raised an urgent need to develop effective therapeutics against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As a potential antiviral drug target, the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 functions as a viral RNA chaperone and plays vital and multifunctional roles during the life cycle of coronavirus1-3. In this study, we discovered that the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) both in vitro and in vivo, which is further modulated by viral RNA. In addition, we found that, the core component of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2, nsp12, preferentially partitions into the N protein condensates. Moreover, we revealed that, two small molecules, i.e., CVL218 and PJ34, can be used to intervene the N protein driven phase separation and loosen the compact structures of the condensates of the N-RNA-nsp12 complex of SARS-CoV-2. The discovery of the LLPS-mediated interplay between N protein and nsp12 and the corresponding modulating compounds illuminates a feasible way to improve the accessibility of antiviral drugs (e.g., remdesivir) to their targets (e.g., nsp12/RdRp), and thus may provide useful hints for further development of effective therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we investigate the effect of electrolytes on the stability of the complex between the coronavirus type 2 spike protein receptor domain (CoV-2 RBD) and ACE2, which plays an important role in the activation cascade at the viral entry of CoV-2 into human cells. At the cellular surface, electrolytes play an important role, especially in the interaction of proteins near the membrane surface. Additionally, the binding interface of the CoV-2 RBD - ACE2 complex is highly hydrophilic. We simulated the CoV-2 RBD - ACE2 complex at varying salt concentrations over the concentration range from 0.03 M to 0.3 M of calcium and sodium chloride over an individual simulation length of 750 ns in 9 independent simulations (6.75 {micro}s total). We observe that the CoV-2 RBD - ACE2 complex is stabilized independent of the salt concentration. We identify a strong negative electrostatic potential at the N-terminal part of CoV-2 RBD and we find that CoV-2 RBD binds even stronger at higher salt concentrations. We observe that the dynamics of the N-terminal part of CoV-2 RBD stabilize the protein complex leading to strong collective motions and a stable interface between CoV-2 RBD and ACE2. We state that the sequence of CoV-2 RBD might be optimized for a strong binding to ACE2 at varying salt concentrations at the cellular surface, which acts as a key component in the activation of CoV-2 for its viral entry.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEA novel coronavirus, coronavirus type 2 (CoV-2), was identified as primary cause for a worldwide pandemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS CoV-2). The CoV-2 spike protein is a major target for the development of a vaccine and potential strategies to inhibit the viral entry into human cells. At the cellular surface, CoV-2 activation involves the direct interaction between ACE2 and CoV-2 RBD. At the cellular surface, electrolytes play an important role, especially in the interaction of proteins near the membrane surface. We thus investigate the effect of ion conditions on the interaction of the CoV-2 RBD - ACE2 complex and find stabilizing effects. We speculate that CoV-2 RBD is optimized for strong binding to ACE2 at varying salt concentrations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundClinic-based estimates of SARS-CoV-2 may considerably underestimate the total number of infections. Access to testing in the US has been heterogeneous and symptoms vary widely in infected persons. Public health surveillance efforts and metrics are therefore hampered by underreporting. We set out to provide a minimally biased estimate of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among adults for a large and diverse county (Orange County, CA, population 3.2 million).\n\nMethodsWe implemented a surveillance study that minimizes response bias by recruiting adults to answer a survey without knowledge of later being offered a SARS-CoV-2 test. Several methodologies were used to retrieve a population-representative sample. Participants (n=2,979) visited one of 11 drive-thru test sites from July 10th to August 16th, 2020 (or received an in-home visit) to provide a finger pin-prick sample. We applied a robust SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Microarray technology, which has superior measurement validity relative to FDA-approved tests.\n\nFindingsParticipants include a broad age, gender, racial/ethnic, and income representation. Adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 11.5% (95% CI: 10.5% to 12.4%). Formal bias analyses produced similar results. Prevalence was elevated among Hispanics (vs. other non-Hispanic: prevalence ratio [PR]= 1.47, 95% CI: 1.22 to 1.78) and household income <$50,000 (vs. >$100,000: PR= 1.42, 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.79).\n\nInterpretationResults from a diverse population using a highly specific and sensitive microarray indicate a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of [~]12 percent. This population-based seroprevalence is seven-fold greater than that using official County statistics. In this region, SARS-CoV-2 also disproportionately affects Hispanic and low-income adults.\n\nFundingOrange County Healthcare Agency",

    "abstract": "The use of face masks by the general population during viral outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic, although at times controversial, has been effective in slowing down the spread of the virus. The fit of simple cloth masks on the face as well as the resulting perimeter leakage and face mask efficacy are expected to be highly dependent on the type of mask and facial topology. However, this effect has to date, not been examined and quantified. Here, we study the leakage of a rectangular cloth mask on a large virtual population of subjects with diverse facial features, using computational mechanics modeling. The effect of weight, age, gender, and height on the leakage is studied. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended mask size was used as a basis for comparison and was found not to be the most effective design for all subjects. Thin, feminine, and young faces benefit from mask sizes smaller than that recommended by the CDC. The results show that side-edge tuck-in of the masks could lead to a larger localized gap opening in many face categories, and is therefore not recommended for all. The perimeter leakage from the face mask worn by thin/feminine faces is mostly from the leakage area along the bottom edge of the mask and therefore, a tuck-in of the bottom edge of the mask or a mask smaller than the CDC recommended mask size are proposed as a more effective design. The leakage from the top edge of the mask is determined to be largely unaffected by mask size and tuck-in ratio, meaning that other mechanical alterations such as a nose wire strip are necessary to reduce the leakage at this site.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDuring health crises medical education is often derailed as was the case during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Medical trainees face the daunting task of having to gather, filter and synthesize new information about the evolving situation often without the standardized resources they are used to.\n\nMethodsWe surveyed Canadian medical students, in the hardest hit province of Quebec, on how they were acquiring knowledge as well as what they knew of the pandemic. Google Forms was used, with the survey being distributed to each medical school in Quebec (McGill, ULaval, Udem) both through email and through social media pages for each class year. Two analyses, Mann-Whitney and ANOVA tests, were performed for year of study and degree obtained.\n\nResultsWe received responses from 111 medical students from three universities, which represents 5% of the students invited to complete the survey. Students reported using mass media most frequently (83%) and also had a high rate of use of social media (to gather information about the pandemic. They rated these resources low in terms of their trustworthiness despite the high rates of use (average 2.91 and 2.03 of 5 respectively). Medical students also endorsed using more formal resources like public health information, scientific journals and faculty-provided information that they trusted more, however, they accessed these resources at lower rates. Of note, medical students had correct answered 60% of COVID-19 prevention strategies, 73% clinical correct answers, 90% epidemiological correct answers. Additionally, students who were training in the larger city of Montreal, where the worst of the outbreak was focused, tended to significantly perform better (p<0.0001) than their colleagues who were not located there.\n\nConclusionThese finding indicate a wide use of information resources intended for public consumption rather than more rigorous and trustworthy sources. Furthermore, there seems to be a knowledge gap amongst medical students responding to this survey that suggests an opportunity to improve the delivery of educational content during this rapidly evolving pandemic.",

To explore the impact of RAS inhibitor use on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, from all published studies.\n\nMethods and FindingsA systematic review and meta-analysis of the use of RAS inhibitors in relation to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and/or the severity and mortality associated with COVID-19 was conducted. English language bibliographic databases PubMed, Web of Science, OVID Embase, Scopus, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, searched from Jan 1st, 2020 to July 20th, 2020. 58 observational studies (69,200 COVID-19 patients and 3,103,335 controls) were included. There was no difference in the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection between RAS inhibitor users and non-users (unadjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.21), (adjusted OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.02), (adjusted HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.31).

    "abstract": "BackgroundOutbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 have occurred worldwide in Long Term Care Facilities (LTCFs), but the reasons why some facilities are particularly vulnerable to infection are poorly understood. We aimed to identify risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outbreaks in LTCFs.\n\nMethodsCross-sectional survey of all LTCFs providing dementia care or care to adults >65 years in England with linkage to SARS-CoV-2 test results. Exposures included: LTCF characteristics, staffing factors, and use of disease control measures. Main outcomes included risk factors for infection and outbreaks, estimated using multivariable logistic regression, and survey and test-based weighted estimates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence.\n\nFindings5126/9081 (56%) LTCFs participated in the survey, with 160,033 residents and 248,594 staff. The weighted period prevalence of infection in residents and staff respectively was 10.5% (95% CI: 9.9-11.1%) and 3.8% (95%: 3.4-4.2%) and 2724 LTCFs (53.1%) had [&ge;]1 infection. Odds of infection and/or outbreaks were reduced in LTCFs that paid sickness pay, cohorted staff, did not employ agency staff and had higher staff to resident ratios. Higher odds of infection and outbreaks were identified in facilities with more admissions, lower cleaning frequency, poor compliance with isolation and \"for profit\" status.\n\nInterpretationHalf of LTCFs had no cases suggesting they remain vulnerable to outbreaks. Reducing transmission from staff requires adequate sick pay, minimal use of temporary staff, improved staffing ratios and staff cohorting. Transmission from residents is associated with the number of admissions to the facility and poor compliance with isolation.\n\nFundingUK Government Department of Health & Social Care\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSCOVID-19 outbreaks have occurred worldwide in long-term care facilities (LTCFs), which provide care to elderly and vulnerable residents, and are associated with high mortality. The reasons why LTCFs are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 are poorly understood. Most studies of risk factors for COVID-19 to date have been limited by scale, and poor quality administrative, demographic and infection control data. We conducted a systematic search on 27 July 2020 in MEDLINE Ovid, WHO COVID-19 database and in MedRxiv to identify studies reporting risk factors for COVID-19 infection or outbreaks in LTCFs, with no date or language restrictions. We used the search terms \"COVID-19\", \"SARS-CoV-2\", \"coronavirus\" and \"care home\", \"nursing home\", \"long term care facilit\" and excluded studies that did not investigate LTCF-level risk factors. 14 studies met our inclusion criteria comprising 11 cross-sectional studies and 3 surveys. The largest cross-sectional study was conducted in 9395 specialised nursing facilities across 30 states in USA; the largest survey was conducted in 124 LTCFs in Haute-Garrone region of France. Risk of bias was high across all studies, and results could not be pooled due to heterogeneity between studies. Main risk factors for infection and/or outbreaks related to the size of the facility, lower ratios of staff to residents, urban location, higher occupancy, and the community prevalence of infection. Only one study collected data on the use of disease control measures during the pandemic, and no studies provided data on risk factors such as the use of temporary staff, or the impact of staff working across multiple locations.\n\nAdded value of this studyWe conducted a national telephone survey with managers of all LTCFs in England which provided dementia care or care to residents aged > 65 years to collect data on the number of staff and residents in each facility, confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, characteristics of the facility e.g.size, staffing (use of temporary staff, staffing ratios, sickness pay) and disease control measures such as cohorting and isolation. We identified risk factors for infection in residents and staff, outbreaks (defined as [&ge;]1 case per LTCF) and large outbreaks using logistic regression. We also estimated the proportion of staff and residents who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Responses were obtained from 5126 of out 9081 (56%) of eligible LTCFs. To our knowledge, this is the largest and most detailed survey of risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outbreaks that has been conducted in LTCFs.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceAlmost half of LTCFs surveyed in this study did not report any cases of infection, and remain vulnerable to infection and outbreaks, highlighting the need for effective control measures. Reducing transmission from staff requires adequate sick pay, minimal use of temporary staff, improved staffing ratios and staff cohorting. Transmission from residents is associated with the number of admissions to the facility and poor compliance with control measures such as isolation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundREACT-1 is a community survey of PCR confirmed swab-positivity for SARS-CoV-2 among random samples of the population in England. This interim report includes data from the fifth round of data collection currently underway for swabs sampled from the 18th to 26th September 2020.\n\nMethodsRepeated cross-sectional surveys of random samples of the population aged 5 years and over in England with sample size ranging from 120,000 to 160,000 people in each round of data collection. Collection of self-administered nose and throat swab for PCR and questionnaire data. Prevalence of swab-positivity by round and by demographic variables including age, sex, region, ethnicity. Estimation of reproduction number (R) between and within rounds, and time trends using exponential growth or decay model. Assessment of geographical clustering based on boundary-free spatial model.\n\nResultsOver the 9 days for which data are available, we find 363 positives from 84,610 samples giving a weighted prevalence to date of 0.55% (0.47%, 0.64%) in round 5. This implies that 411,000 (351,000, 478,000) people in England are virus-positive under the assumption that the swab assay is 75% sensitive. Using data from the most recent two rounds, we estimate a doubling time of 10.6 (9.4, 12.0) days covering the period 20th August to 26th September, corresponding to a reproduction number R of 1.47 (1.40, 1.53). Using data only from round 5 we estimate a reproduction number of 1.06 (0.74, 1.46) with probability of 63% that R is greater than 1. Between rounds 4 and 5 there was a marked increase in unweighted prevalence at all ages. In the most recent data, prevalence was highest in the 18 to 24 yrs age group at 0.96% (0.68%, 1.36%). At 65+ yrs prevalence increased [~]7-fold between rounds 4 and 5 from 0.04% (0.03%, 0.07%) to 0.29% (0.23%, 0.37%). Prevalence increased in all regions between rounds 4 and 5, giving the highest unweighted prevalence in round 5 in the North West at 0.86% (0.69%, 1.06%). In London, prevalence increased [~]5-fold from 0.10% (0.06%, 0.17%) to 0.49% (0.36%, 0.68%). Regional R values ranged from 1.32 (1.16,1.50) in Yorkshire and the Humber to 1.63 (1.42, 1.88) in the East Midlands over the same period. In the most recent data, there was extensive clustering in the North West, Midlands and in and around London with pockets of clustering in other regions including the South West, North East and East of England. Odds of swab-positivity were [~]2-fold higher in people of Asian and Black ethnicity compared with white participants.\n\nConclusionRapid growth has led to high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in England among all regions and age groups, including those age groups at highest risk. Although there is evidence of a recent deceleration in the epidemic, current levels of prevalence will inevitably result in additional hospitalisations and mortality in coming weeks. A re-doubling of public health efforts is needed to return to a declining phase of the epidemic.",

    "abstract": "In the situation where expansion of coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19) does not stop, there is concern about co-infection of people with the seasonal influenza infections from late autumn to winter 2020. Therefore, the importance of supplying vaccines against the seasonal influenza has been pointed out all over the world. As an example in Japan, the number of people infected with the seasonal influenza, hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, and pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF), which are the seasonal infectious diseases in the 2020 season, has decreased remarkably compared to the number of people infected each year. It is believed that the significant reduction in the number of people infected with these seasonal infectious diseases is a result of the pervasive hand washing, wearing masks and maintaining social distance in COVID-19 rea. To examine the correlation between the three factors of the number of people with each seasonal infectious disease, the mask wearing rate, and the outing rate, we created a three-dimensional scatter plot based on these three factors using principal component analysis. Our research findings demonstrated preventive effect of no going out against co-infection with the seasonal influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBrazil has the third-highest number of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases worldwide. Understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 from reported cases is challenging due to heterogeneous testing rates. We estimated the number of COVID-19 cases in Brazil on a national and regional level using digital technology.\n\nMethodsWe used a web-based application to perform a population-based survey from March 21st to August 29th, 2020 in Brazil. We obtained responses from 243 461 individuals across all federative units, who answered questions on COVID-19-related symptoms, chronic diseases and address of residence. COVID-19 was defined as at least one of the following: fever, cough, dyspnea and nasal flaring, associated with a history of close contact with a suspect or confirmed COVID-19 case in the previous 14 days. A stratified two-stage weighted survey analysis was performed to estimate the population level prevalence of COVID-19 cases.\n\nResultsAfter calibration weighing, we estimated that 10 339 461 cases of COVID-19 occurred, yielding a 2.75 estimated infection per officially reported case. Estimated/reported ratios varied across Brazilian states and were higher in states with lower human development indexes. Areas with lower income levels displayed higher rates of COVID-19 cases (66 vs 38 cases/1000 people in the lowest and highest income strata respectively, p<0.001), but presented lower rates of COVID-19 testing.\n\nConclusionIn this population-based survey using digital technology in Brazil, we estimated that the COVID-19 case rates were 2.75 times higher than officially reported. The estimated per reported case ratios were higher in areas with worse socioeconomic status.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic exposed difficulties in scaling current quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based diagnostic methodologies for large-scale infectious disease testing. Bottlenecks include the lengthy multi-step process of nucleic acid extraction followed by qPCR readouts, which require costly instrumentation and infrastructure, as well as reagent and plastic consumable shortages stemming from supply chain constraints. Here we report a novel Oil Immersed Lossless Total Analysis System (OIL-TAS), which integrates RNA extraction and detection onto a single device that is simple, rapid, cost effective, uses minimal supplies and requires reduced infrastructure to perform. We validated the performance of OIL-TAS using contrived samples containing inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viral particles, which show that the assay can reliably detect an input concentration of 10 copies/L and sporadically detect down to 1 copy/L. The OIL-TAS method can serve as a faster, cheaper, and easier-to-deploy alternative to current qPCR-based methods for infectious disease testing.",

    "abstract": "Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, many rumors have emerged. Given prior research linking rumor exposure to mental well-being, we conducted a nation-wide survey to document the base rate of rumor exposure and factors associated with rumor vulnerability. Between March to July 2020, 1237 participants were surveyed on 5 widely-disseminated COVID-19 rumors (that drinking water frequently could be preventive, that eating garlic could be preventive, that the outbreak arose because of bat soup consumption, that the virus was created in an American lab, and that the virus was created in a Chinese lab). For each rumor, participants reported whether they had heard, shared or believed each rumor. Although most participants had been exposed to COVID-19 rumors, few shared or believed these. Sharing behaviors sometimes occurred in the absence of belief; however, education emerged as a protective factor for both sharing and belief. Together, our results suggest that campaigns targeting skills associated with higher education (e.g. epistemology) may prove more effective than counter-rumor messages.\n\nHighlightsO_LIPrior studies linked exposure to COVID-19 rumors with poor mental health.\nC_LIO_LIIn a community sample, most participants reported having heard rumors.\nC_LIO_LIFew participants shared or believed rumors.\nC_LIO_LISharing sometimes occurred in the absence of belief.\nC_LIO_LIMore educated individuals believed and shared fewer rumors.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "An unprecedented outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the form of peculiar pneumonia has spread globally since its first case at Wuhan, China, in December 2019, increasing infected cases and mortality at a pandemic speed. Thus, forecasting the COVID-19 pandemic became a key research interest for both the epidemiologists and statisticians. These future predictions are useful for the effective allocation of health care resources, stockpiling, and help in strategic planning for clinicians, government authorities, and public-health policymakers after understanding the extent of the effect. The main objective of this paper is to develop the most suitable forecasting model that can generate real-time short-term (ten days) and long-term (fifty days) out-of-sample forecasts of COVID-19 outbreaks for eight profoundly affected countries, namely the United States of America, Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa, Mexico, Spain, and Iran. A novel hybrid approach based on the Theta model and Autoregressive neural network (ARNN) model, named Theta-ARNN (TARNN) model, is proposed. The proposed method outperforms previously available single and hybrid forecasting models for COVID-19 predictions in most data sets. In addition, the ergodicity and asymptotic stationarity of the proposed TARNN model are established which is of particular interest in nonlinear time series literature. An R-Shiny application is created for implementation of TARNN model and is publicly available1.",

    "abstract": "The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which was first discovered in Hubei, China in December 2019, has caused an ongoing pandemic. Due to pauci-symptomatic cases, the virus may spread invisibly in a community. In the absence of vaccination, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) like interpersonal distancing were implemented in several countries and have been key to effectively reduce viral spreading. In Germany after an exponential growth of case numbers in March 2020, NPIs were able to effectively control the pandemic and sufficiently reduced the daily reported new infections allowing for partial release of NPIs. We developed a novel statistical method to evaluate contacts between individuals, which is essential for virus transmission. We derived the contact index, an index for the intensity and heterogeneity of contact behavior from spatial proximity between individuals as proxy for physical interaction based on complex network science. We estimated the contact index from large-scale GPS mobile phone data of 1.15 to 1.4 million users in Germany per day (March to July 2020). A high correlation between the contact index and the effective reproduction number six days later could be observed (Pearson correlation r = 0.96, P-value < 0.001 for all reported Pearson correlations). This correlation was observed in three different phases of the virus spread in Germany 1) the early phase of the first wave with the highest reproduction rate, 2) phase of strict NPIs (lockdown) with the lowest reproduction, 3) release of NPIs accompanied with an increase of reproduction. The results show that the contact index is able to model and potentially forecast the time evolution of the pandemic in Germany.",

    "abstract": "A major issue in identification of protective T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 lies in distinguishing people infected with SARS-CoV-2 from those with cross-reactive immunity generated by exposure to other coronaviruses. We characterised SARS-CoV-2 T cell immune responses in 168 PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects and 118 seronegative subjects without known SARS-CoV-2 exposure using a range of T cell assays that differentially capture immune cell function. Strong ex vivo ELISpot and proliferation responses to multiple antigens (including M, NP and ORF3) were found in those who had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 but were rare in pre-pandemic and unexposed seronegative subjects. However, seronegative doctors with high occupational exposure and recent COVID-19 compatible illness showed patterns of T cell responses characteristic of infection, indicating that these readouts are highly sensitive. By contrast, over 90% of convalescent or unexposed people showed proliferation and cellular lactate responses to spike subunits S1/S2, indicating pre-existing cross-reactive T cell populations. The detection of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 is therefore critically dependent on the choice of assay and antigen. Memory responses to specific non-spike proteins provides a method to distinguish recent infection from pre-existing immunity in exposed populations.",

    "abstract": "The shortage of N95 masks have spurred efforts on developing safe and scientifically-validated decontamination and reuse protocols that are easily scalable and universally applicable even in low-resource settings. We report on the development and implementation of a heat-based N95 mask decontamination system in a large hospital setting (Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India) with over 8000 N95 masks from about 1400 individual users decontaminated and in reuse till date. We describe the challenges and constraints in choosing a proven, scalable, and easy-to-implement decontamination solution. We discuss the heat treatment and particle filtration efficiency measurement experiments done to validate a decontamination treatment protocol at a target temperature of 70{degrees}C for a duration of 60 minutes, and the scaling up of this method using a standard hot drying cabinet at the hospital. The logistics of ensuring optimal utilization of the decontamination facility without compromising on basic safety principles are detailed. Our method relies on equipment available in standard hospitals, is simple to set-up, scalable, and can be easily replicated in low-resource settings. We further believe such limited reuse strategies, even in times of abundant N95 mask availability, would not only be cost-saving but also be environmentally responsible in reducing the amount of medical waste.",

Serum samples collected [&ge;]14 days after onset of symptoms, or [&ge;]14 days after an initial SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive test for asymptomatics, showed diagnostic sensitivities ranging from 67.9-75.0% when including all possible disease severities and increased to 90.0-95.0% when examining those with moderate to critical disease. Grouping moderate to critical disease showed a significant association with a SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive result for all assays. Diagnostic specificity, assessed by testing serum samples collected during 2018-2019 from healthy persons and from persons with antibodies to a wide range of viral infections, ranged from 96.7-100.0%. For all assays examined, SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values of the initial nasopharyngeal swab sample testing positive were significantly different for samples testing antibody positive versus negative. These data from a predominantly African descent Caribbean population shows comparable diagnostic sensitivities and specificities for all testing platforms assessed and limited utility of these tests for persons with asymptomatic and mild infections.",

    "abstract": "Rationale Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) is the major complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), yet optimal respiratory support strategies are uncertain. Objectives To describe outcomes with high-flow oxygen delivered through nasal cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in COVID-19 AHRF and identify individual factors associated with failure. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized adults with COVID-19 treated with HFNC and/or NIPPV to describe rates of success (live discharge without endotracheal intubation (ETI)), and identify characteristics associated with failure (ETI and/or in-hospital mortality) using Fine-Gray sub-distribution hazard models. Results A total of 331 and 747 patients received HFNC and NIPPV as the highest level of non-invasive respiratory support, respectively; 154 (46.5%) in the HFNC cohort and 167 (22.4%) in the NIPPV cohort were successfully discharged without requiring ETI. In adjusted models, significantly increased risk of HFNC and NIPPV failure was seen among patients with cardiovascular disease (subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) 1.82; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.17-2.83 and sHR 1.40; 95% CI 1.06-1.84), respectively, and among those with lower oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2) ratio at HFNC and NIPPV initiation (sHR, 0.32; 95% CI 0.19-0.54, and sHR 0.34; 95% CI 0.21-0.55, respectively). Conclusions A significant proportion of patients receiving non-invasive respiratory modalities for COVID-19 AHRF achieved successful discharge without requiring ETI, with lower success rates among those with cardiovascular disease or more severe hypoxia. The role of non-invasive respiratory modalities in COVID-19 related AHRF requires further consideration.",

    "abstract": "How do we forecast an emerging pandemic in real time in a purely data-driven manner? How to leverage rich heterogeneous data based on various signals such as mobility, testing, and/or disease exposure for forecasting? How to handle noisy data and generate uncertainties in the forecast? In this paper, we present DeepCOVID, an operational deep learning framework designed for real-time COVID-19 forecasting. DeepCOVID works well with sparse data and can handle noisy heterogeneous data signals by propagating the uncertainty from the data in a principled manner resulting in meaningful uncertainties in the forecast. The framework also consists of modules for both real-time and retrospective exploratory analysis to enable interpretation of the forecasts. Results from real-time predictions (featured on the CDC website and FiveThirtyEight.com) since April 2020 indicates that our approach is competitive among the methods in the COVID-19 Forecast Hub, especially for short-term predictions.",

    "abstract": "We provide an explanation for the apparent discrepancy between the dynamic of the positive COVID-19 test rates and of the numbers of COVID-19-related hospital and intensive care admissions and deaths in France. We highlight the existence of a latency period of around 5 weeks between the infections of young individual (generally asymptomatic) to older individuals that may have a severe form of the disease and may be hospitalized. If the overall positive detection rate provided relevant information until the end of August, since the beginning of September the overall positive detection rate has reached a plateau and no longer provides relevant information on the current state of the epidemic. We show that the incidence rate in the 70+ age group is a relevant and early indicator of the epidemic. Furthermore, we have shown an identical doubling time of around 15 days for the following indicators: the incidence rate for the 70+ age group, the number of new admissions to hospital, intensive care unit admissions and deaths.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Soon, it has spread out across the world and become an ongoing pandemic. In Bangladesh, the first case of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was detected on March 8, 2020. Since then, not many significant studies have been conducted to understand the transmission dynamics of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh. In this study, we estimated the basic reproduction number R0 of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh. Methods: The data of daily confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh and the reported values of generation time of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) for Singapore and Tianjin, China, were collected. We calculated the basic reproduction number R0 by applying the exponential growth (EG) method. Epidemic data of the first 76 days and different values of generation time were used for the calculation. Results: The basic reproduction number R0 of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh is estimated to be 2.66 [95% CI: 2.58-2.75], optimized R0 is 2.78 [95% CI: 2.69-2.88] using generation time 5.20 with a standard deviation of 1.72 for Singapore. Using generation time 3.95 with a standard deviation of 1.51 for Tianjin, China, R0 is estimated to be 2.15 [95% CI: 2.09-2.20], optimized R0 is 2.22 [95% CI: 2.16-2.29]. Conclusions: The calculated basic reproduction number R0 of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh is significantly higher than 1, which indicates its high transmissibility and contagiousness.",

    "abstract": "Under public health emergencies, particularly an early epidemic, it is fundamental that genetic and other healthcare data is shared across borders in both a timely and accurate manner before the outbreak of a global pandemic. However, although the COVID-19 pandemic has created a tidal wave of data, most patient data is siloed, not easily accessible, and due to low sample size, largely not actionable. Based on the precision medicine platform Shivom, a novel and secure data sharing and data analytics marketplace, we developed a versatile pandemic preparedness platform that allows healthcare professionals to rapidly share and analyze genetic data. The platform solves several problems of the global medical and research community, such as siloed data, cross-border data sharing, lack of state-of-the-art analytic tools, GDPR-compliance, and ease-of-use. The platform serves as a central marketplace of  discoverability. The platform combines patient genomic & omics data sets, a marketplace for AI & bioinformatics algorithms, new diagnostic tools, and data-sharing capabilities to advance virus epidemiology and biomarker discovery. The bioinformatics marketplace contains some preinstalled COVID-19 pipelines to analyze virus- and host genomes without the need for bioinformatics expertise. The platform will be the quickest way to rapidly gain insight into the association between virus-host interactions and COVID-19 in various populations which can have a significant impact on managing the current pandemic and potential future disease outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "The IFR (Infection Fatality Risk) is one of the most important parameters of an infectious disease. If properly estimated, the observed number of deaths divided by the IFR can be used to estimate the current number of infections and, if immunity is permanent, we can estimate the fraction of susceptible which can be used to plan reopening of activities and vaccine deployment, when these become available. Here we suggest how to use the observed deaths by COVID-19 in an arbitrary population as a surrogate for the progression of the epidemic with the purpose of decision making. We compare several estimates of IFR for SARS-CoV-2 with our estimate that uses the number of additional deaths in households in a database population of 159,150 laboratory-confirmed (RT-qPCR) COVID-19 by SARS-COV-2 in Mexico. The main result is that if the number of deaths in a region is close to 2 per thousand individuals, the fraction of remaining susceptible may be too small for the vaccine to make a difference in the total number of infected.",

    "abstract": "Background. By mid-September of 2020, the number of daily new infections in India have crossed 95,000. To facilitate an intuition for the spatio-temporal development of the pandemic and to help resource deployment planning, we analyze and describe how the disease burden almost-predictably shifted from large metropolitan districts to sub-urban districts. Methods. We gathered the publicly available granular data from 186 different districts (equivalent of counties) on their COVID-19 infections and deaths during the 15 April to 31 August 2020 period. These districts presented an active case burden of 559,566 and a cumulative 2,715,656 infections as of August 31. The epidemiological data of these districts was fit to a susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-recovered-dead (SAIRD) model and the underlying epidemic parameters for each of these districts during the course of 4 months was estimated. We validated these parameters against known epidemiological characteristic distributions and analyzed them to understand their changes in space-time during the pandemic. Findings. The center of the burden of the current-active infections which on May 15 was in the large metro districts with most international access shifted continuously and smoothly shifted towards districts which could be accessed by domestic airports and by trains. A linear trend-analysis showed a continuous improvement in most epidemic parameters consistently across the districts with four categories of accessibility from an international travel perspective - large metro, metro, urban and sub-urban districts. The reproduction numbers improved from 1.77{+/-}0.58 on May 15 to 1.07{+/-} 0.13 on August 31 in large metro districts (p-Value of trend 0.0001053); and from 1.58{+/-}0.39 on May 15 to 0.94{+/-}0.11 on August 31 in sub-urban districts (p-Value of trend 0.0067). The recovery rate per infected person per day improved from 0.0581{+/-}0.009 on May 15 to 0.091{+/-}0.010 on August 31 in large metro districts (p-Value of trend 0.26.10^{-12}); and from 0.059{+/-}0.011 on May 15 to 0.100{+/-}0.010 on August 31 in sub-urban districts (p-Value of trend 0.12.10{-16}). The death rate of symptomatic individuals which includes the case-fatality-rate as well as the time from symptoms to death, consistently decreased from 0.0025{+/-}0.0014 on May 15 to 0.0013{+/-}0.0003 on August 31 in large metro districts (p-Value of trend 0.0010); and from 0.0018{+/-}0.0008 on May 15 to 0.0014{+/-}0.0003 on August 31 in sub-urban districts (p-Value of trend 0.2789. Interpretation. As the daily infections continue to rise at a national level, it is important to notice a `local-flattening' in larger metro districts, and a shift of the pandemic-burden towards smaller sized districts in a clear hierarchical fashion of accessibility from an international travel perspective. The pandemic burden shifting towards remotely accessible regions, with possibly lesser health care facilities, is a call for attention to the re-organization of resources.",

    "abstract": "Recent findings suggest that an adequate test-trace-isolate (TTI) strategy is needed to prevent a secondary COVID-19 wave with the reopening of society in the UK. Here we assess the potential importance of mandatory masks in the parts of community and in secondary schools. We show that, assuming current TTI levels, adoption of masks in secondary schools in addition to community settings can reduce the size of a second wave, but will not prevent it; more testing of symptomatic people, tracing and isolating of their contacts is also needed. To avoid a second wave, with masks mandatory in secondary schools and in certain community settings, under current tracing levels, 68% or 46% of those with symptomatic infection would need to be tested if masks effective coverage were 15% or 30% respectively, compared to 76% and 57% if masks are mandated in community settings but not secondary schools.",

    "abstract": "During a crisis, the messaging platform WhatsApp allows crisis-related information to be disseminated quickly. Although case studies have documented how WhatsApp has shaped crisis outcomes in both beneficial and harmful ways, little is known about: (i) how crisis-related content is spread; (ii) characteristics of users based on usage patterns; or (iii) how usage patterns link to well-being. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, this study used the experience sampling method to track the daily WhatsApp usage of 151 adults throughout one week (capturing a total of 924 days of crisis-related communication). Each day, participants reported the extent to which they had received, forwarded, or discussed COVID-19- related content. During the week-long monitoring, most participants (94.7%) reported at least one COVID-19 related use of WhatsApp. Those who engaged with more COVID-19 content in personal chats were more likely to report having COVID-19 thoughts throughout the day. We further observed that around 1 in 10 individuals (14%) were chronic users who received and shared forwarded COVID-19 messages at a high volume; this group may represent everyday \"super spreaders\" of crisis-related content. Together, these findings provide an empirical base for policy makers to manage risk communication during large-scale crises.",

    "abstract": "Recently, respiratory aerosols with diameters smaller than 100 m have been con- firmed as important vectors for the spread of SARS-CoV-2. While cloth masks afford some protection for larger ballistic droplets, they are typically inefficient at filtering these aerosols and require specialized fabrication devices to produce. We describe a fabrication technique that makes use of a folding procedure (origami) to transform a filtration material into a mask. These origami masks can be fabricated by non-experts at minimal cost and effort, provide adequate filtration efficiencies, and are easily scaled to different facial sizes. Using a mannequin fit test simulator, we demonstrate that these masks can provide optimal filtration efficiency and ease of breathing with minimal leak- age. Because this mask provides greater comfort compared to commercial alternatives, it is likely to promote greater mask wearing tolerance and acceptance.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION.Prevention measures are highly important to poor communities because surveillance and access to health care may be limited.OBJECTIVES We aimed establish measures to contain and suppress the spread of COVID-19, associating education, active case tracking, and humanitarian aid in two needy communities in Brazil. The adherence to the measures and evolution of the number of cases were verified during the project.MATERIALS AND METHODS.The target population consisted of approximately 1300 participants(350 families). A collection of epidemiological data was performed in family members registered for the project. Rapid tests were performed on people who had symptoms and their contacts. Scientific information through audio-visual materials,educational pamphlets written in colloquial language, food parcels,masks,hygiene and cleaning materials were provided directly to family nuclei. RESULTS The common needs faced by families were food inputs and/or ready-to-eat food, mentioned by 91.4% (233) of the people, and hygienic and cleaning materials, mentioned by 30.6% (78) of the people. Only 34.9% (84) of families had 70% rubbing alcohol or hand sanitizer gel at home.The most frequently cited sources of information on COVID-19 were television [cited by 82.4% (210) of the people]; social media [25.5% (65)]; friends, neighbours, or family members [13.7% (35)]; and radio [11.4% (29)] .A total of 83.7% (175) stated that the actions helped them to avoid leaving the community.CONCLUSIONS Community isolation may be the best way to contain the spread of pandemics in fragile populations with low socio-economic status.Educational actions combined with rapid testing and humanitarian aid were objective forms to promote community isolation.",

    "abstract": "Background With shortages of face-masks continuing to be reported worldwide, critical questions like whether or not there is an adequate alternative to commercially manufactured face-masks continue to linger especially in low- and middle- income settings. This study aimed at addressing this through testing and comparing various materials and forms of face-masks for filtration efficiency, breathability, microbial cleanliness, distance-dependent fitness, and re-usability of different face-masks procured from face-mask vendors in Kampala, Uganda. Methods This was a laboratory-based descriptive study that applied new protocols and already existing protocols with substantive modifications to ten different types of face-mask types each in quadruplicate to achieve each specified aim. Results Surgical face-masks had better filtration efficiency, distance-dependent fitness and breathability compared to other face-masks tested. Decontamination of these face-masks with 70% ethanol negatively affected their efficacy. Locally-made double layered face-masks had better: filtration efficiency, distance-dependent fitness and breathability compared to other locally-made cloth face-masks, and re-usability compared to all the face-mask types that had been tested. Discussion/conclusions Locally-made double layered cloth face-masks could serve as alternative face-masks especially for populations in low- and middle- income settings like Uganda while allowing restricted use of surgical face-masks and other respirators like the KN95 to high-risk groups only.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: The severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic disrupted medical care for persons with cancer including those with lymphoma. Many professional societies recommend postponing, decreasing or stopping anti-cancer therapy in selected persons during the pandemic. However, although seemingly sensible these recommendations are not evidence-based and their impact on anxiety and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) is unknown. Methods: Surveyed 2532 subjects including 1060 persons with lymphoma, 948 caregivers and 524 normal, uninvolved persons using a purposed-designed questionnaire on a patient organization website. Respondents also completed the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety and patient respondents, the EORTC QLQ-C30 instruments to quantify anxiety and HRQoL. We also evaluated caregiver support and an online education programme of the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO). Data of HRQoL from a 2019 pre-pandemic online survey of 1106 persons with lymphoma was a control. Results: 33% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 30, 36%) of lymphoma patients and 31% (28, 34%) of caregivers but only 21% (17, 24%) of normal individuals had any level of anxiety (both pair-wise P < 0.001). Amongst lymphoma respondents physical exercise and better caregiver support were associated with less anxiety whereas female sex, receiving therapy and reduced therapy intensity were associated with more anxiety. Paradoxically, lymphoma respondents during the pandemic had better HRQoL than pre-pandemic controls. Reduced therapy intensity was associated with worse HRQoL whereas respondents who scored caregiver support and the online patient education programme high had better HRQoL. Conclusions: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic lymphoma patients and their caregivers had significantly higher incidence of anxiety compared with normals. Lymphoma respondents reported better HRQoL compared with pre-pandemic controls. Reduced therapy-intensity in patients with cancer may have unanticipated adverse effects on anxiety and HRQoL. Regular and intense support by caregivers and online education programmes alleviate anxiety and improve HRQoL.",

    "abstract": "Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at particular risk to acquire SARS-CoV-2 infections. Aim: The objectives of this study were to compare SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence and compliance to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) between HCWs working within (high-risk) or outside (intermediate-risk) units treating suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. In addition, administration staff (low-risk) was included. Materials: Co-HCW is a prospective cohort study among employees at the Jena University Hospital, Germany. Since 16th March 2020, 50 SARS-CoV-2 inpatients and 73 outpatients were treated in our hospital. Mandatory masking was implemented on 20th March 2020. We here evaluated seroprevalence using two IgG detecting immunoassays, assessed COVID-19 exposure, clinical symptoms and compliance to wear PPE. Findings: Between 19th May and 19th June 2020 we analysed 660 employees [out of 3,228; 20.4%]. Eighteen participants (2.7%) had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in at least one immunoassay. Among them, 13 (72.2%) were not aware of direct COVID-19 exposure and 9 (50.0%) did not report any clinical symptoms. We observed no evidence for an association between seroprevalence and risk area (high-risk: 2 of 137 HCWs (1.5%), intermediate-risk: 10 of 343 HCWs (2.9%), low-risk: 6 of 180 administration employees (3.3%); p=0.574). Reported compliance to wear PPE differed (p<0.001) between working in high-risk (98.3%) and in intermediate-risk areas (69.8%). Conclusion: No evidence for higher seroprevalence against SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs working in high-risk COVID-19 areas could be observed, probably due to high compliance to wear PPE. Compared to administration employees, we observed no additional risk to acquire SARS-CoV-2 infections by patient care.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMultiple COVID-19 outbreaks have occurred in homeless shelters across the US, highlighting an urgent need to identify the most effective infection control strategy to prevent future outbreaks.\n\nMethodsWe developed a microsimulation model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a homeless shelter and calibrated it to data from cross-sectional polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) surveys conducted during COVID-19 outbreaks in five shelters in three US cities from March 28 to April 10, 2020. We estimated the probability of averting a COVID-19 outbreak in a representative homeless shelter of 250 residents and 50 staff over 30 days under different infection control strategies, including daily symptom-based screening, twice-weekly PCR testing and universal mask wearing.\n\nResultsThe proportion of PCR-positive residents and staff at the shelters with observed outbreaks ranged from 2.6% to 51.6%, which translated to basic reproduction number (R0) estimates of 2.9-6.2. The probability of averting an outbreak diminished with higher transmissibility (R0) within the simulated shelter and increasing incidence in the local community. With moderate community incidence ([~]30 confirmed cases/1,000,000 people/day), the estimated probabilities of averting an outbreak in a low-risk (R0=1.5), moderate-risk (R0=2.9), and high-risk (R0=6.2) shelter were, respectively: 0.33, 0.11 and 0.03 for daily symptom-based screening; 0.52, 0.27, and 0.04 for twice-weekly PCR testing; 0.47, 0.20 and 0.06 for universal masking; and 0.68, 0.40 and 0.08 for these strategies combined.\n\nConclusionsIn high-risk homeless shelter environments and locations with high community incidence of COVID-19, even intensive infection control strategies (incorporating daily symptom-screening, frequent PCR testing and universal mask wearing) are unlikely to prevent outbreaks, suggesting a need for non-congregate housing arrangements for people experiencing homelessness. In lower-risk environments, combined interventions should be adopted to reduce outbreak risk.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an urgent and unprecedented demand for testing - both for diagnosis and prognosis. Here we explore the potential for using sebum, collected via swabbing of a patients skin, as a novel sampling matrix to fulfil these requirements. In this pilot study, sebum samples were collected from 67 hospitalised patients (30 PCR positive and 37 PCR negative). Lipidomics analysis was carried out using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Lipid levels were found to be depressed in COVID-19 positive participants, indicative of dyslipidemia. Orthogonal Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) modelling showed promising separation of COVID-19 positive and negative participants when comorbidities and medication were controlled for. Given that sebum sampling is rapid and non-invasive, this work highlights the potential of this alternative matrix for testing for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The {beta}-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic. Affinity reagents targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the most exposed surface structure of the virus, are of interest for the development of therapeutics and diagnostics. We used affinity selection-mass spectrometry for the rapid discovery of synthetic high affinity peptide binders for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. From library screening with 800 million synthetic peptides, we identified three sequences with nanomolar affinities (dissociation constants Kd = 80 to 970 nM) for RBD and selectivity over human serum proteins. Picomolar RBD concentrations in biological matrix could be detected using the biotinylated lead peptide in ELISA format. These peptides might associate with the SARS-CoV-2-spike-RBD at a site unrelated to ACE2 binding, making them potential orthogonal reagents for sandwich immunoassays. We envision our discovery as a robust starting point for the development of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics or conjugates for virus directed delivery of therapeutics.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=100 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/317131v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@803e9borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18e5d74org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1998310org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16ba5cc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRecruitment into randomized trials of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for prevention of COVID-19 is being threatened by a widespread conviction that HCQ is not effective for prevention. In the absence of an updated systematic review, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized trials that study the effectiveness of HCQ to prevent COVID-19.\n\nMethods and FindingsA search of PubMed, Embase, and medRxiv with expert consultation found four completed randomized trials: two pre-exposure prophylaxis trials and two post-exposure prophylaxis trials. We obtained or calculated the risk ratio of COVID-19 diagnosis for assignment to HCQ versus no HCQ (either placebo or usual care) for each trial, and then pooled the risk ratio estimates. The risk ratio estimated for each of the individual trials were 0.74 (95% CI 0.50-1.10), 0.95 (0.25, 3.64), 0.83 (95% CI: 0.58-1.18), and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.35-1.37). The pooled risk ratio estimate was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.61-0.99) when using either a fixed effect or a standard random effects approach, and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.53-1.16) when using a conservative modification of the Hartung-Knapp random effects approach. All four trials found a similar rate of serious adverse effects in the HCQ and no HCQ groups.\n\nDiscussionA pooled analysis of these randomized trials cannot rule out a moderate reduction of COVID-19 risk after assignment to HCQ. Yet the findings from the randomized trials were widely interpreted as definite evidence of lack of effectiveness of HCQ, simply because they were not \"statistically significant\". Completion of the ongoing trials is needed to generate more precise estimates of the effectiveness of HCQ to prevent COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "We present a method for adjusting the observed epidemic curve of daily new COVID-19 onsets for possible misclassification in infection diagnostics. We discuss different assumptions for specificity and sensitivity of the person-specific COVID-19 diagnostics based on PCR-tests, which are the basis for the daily reported case counts. A specificity of less than one implies occurrence of false positive cases, which becomes particularly relevant with an increased number of tests. The recent increase in cases in Bavaria could therefore be smaller than reported. However, an increase in case counts can still be seen from Mid-July until September 2020. The additional consideration of a sensitivity less than one, i.e., the occurrence of false negative tests, results in an epidemic curve in which the daily case counts are increased by a constant factor, but the structure of the curve does not change considerably.",

    "abstract": "In this research, an extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed to predict the new COVID-19 cases in Algeria. In the present study, public health database from the Algeria health ministry has been used to train and test the ELM models. The input parameters for the predictive models include Cumulative Confirmed COVID-19 Cases (CCCC), Calculated COVID-19 New Cases (CCNC), and Index Day (ID). The predictive accuracy of the seven models has been assessed via several statistical parameters. The results showed that the proposed ELM model achieved an adequate level of prediction accuracy with smallest errors (MSE= 0.16, RMSE=0.4114, and MAE= 0.2912), and highest performances (NSE = 0.9999, IO = 0.9988, R2 = 0.9999). Hence, the ELM model could be utilized as a reliable and accurate modeling approach for predicting the new COVIS-19 cases in Algeria.",

    "abstract": "As of August 27, 2020, the number of cumulative cases of COVID-19 in the US exceeded 5,863,363 and included 180,595 deaths, thus causing a serious public health crisis. Curbing the spread of Covid-19 is still urgently needed. Given the lack of potential vaccines and effective medications, non-pharmaceutical interventions are the major option to curtail the spread of COVID-19. An accurate estimate of the potential impact of different non-pharmaceutical measures on containing, and identify risk factors influencing the spread of COVID-19 is crucial for planning the most effective interventions to curb the spread of COVID-19 and to reduce the deaths. Additive model-based bivariate causal discovery for scalar factors and multivariate Granger causality tests for time series factors are applied to the surveillance data of lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases in the US, University of Maryland Data (UMD) data, and Google mobility data from March 5, 2020 to August 25, 2020 in order to evaluate the contributions of social-biological factors, economics, the Google mobility indexes, and the rate of the virus test to the number of the new cases and number of deaths from COVID-19. We found that active cases/1000 people, workplaces, tests done/1000 people, imported COVID-19 cases, unemployment rate and unemployment claims/1000 people, mobility trends for places of residence (residential), retail and test capacity were the most significant risk factor for the new cases of COVID-19 in 23, 7, 6, 5, 4, 2, 1 and 1 states, respectively, and that active cases/1000 people, workplaces, residential, unemployment rate, imported COVID cases, unemployment claims/1000 people, transit stations, mobility trends (transit) , tests done/1000 people, grocery, testing capacity, retail, percentage of change in consumption, percentage of working from home were the most significant risk factor for the deaths of COVID-19 in 17, 10, 4, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1 states, respectively. We observed that no metrics showed significant evidence in mitigating the COVID-19 epidemic in FL and only a few metrics showed evidence in reducing the number of new cases of COVID-19 in AZ, NY and TX. Our results showed that the majority of non-pharmaceutical interventions had a large effect on slowing the transmission and reducing deaths, and that health interventions were still needed to contain COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 vaccines are being developed urgently worldwide, among which single-shot adenovirus vectored vaccines represent a major approach. Here, we constructed two novel adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccine candidates on simian adenovirus serotype 23 (Sad23L) and human adenovirus serotype 49 vectors (Ad49L) carrying the full-length gene of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S), designated Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines, respectively. The immunogenicity elicited by these two vaccine strains was individually evaluated in mice. Specific humoral and cellular immune responses were proportionally observed in a dose-dependent manner, and stronger response was obtained by boosting. Furthermore, five rhesus macaques were intramuscularly injected with a dose of 5x109 PFU Sad23L-nCoV-S vaccine for prime vaccination, followed by boosting with 5x109 PFU of Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccine at 4-week interval. Three macaques were injected with Sad23L-GFP and Ad49L-GFP vectorial viruses as negative controls. Both mice and macaques tolerated well the vaccine inoculations without detectable clinical or pathologic changes. In macaques, prime-boost vaccination regimen induced high titers of 103.16 S-binding antibody (S-BAb), 102.75 cell receptor binding domain (RBD)-BAb and 102.38 neutralizing antibody (NAb) to pseudovirus a week after boosting injection, followed by sustained high levels over 10 weeks of observation. Robust IFN-{gamma} secreting T-cell response (712.6 SFCs/106 cells), IL-2 secreting T-cell response (334 SFCs/106 cells) and intracellular IFN-{gamma} expressing CD4+/CD8+ T cell response (0.39%/0.55%) to S peptides were detected in the vaccinated macaques. It was concluded that prime-boost immunization with Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines can safely elicit strong immunity in animals in preparation of clinical phase 1/2 trials.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a recently emerged, highly contagious virus and the cause of the current pandemic. It is a zoonotic virus, although its animal origin is not clear yet. Person-to-person transmission occurs by inhalation of infected droplets and aerosols, or by direct contact with contaminated fomites. Arthropods transmit numerous viral, parasitic, and bacterial diseases; however, the potential role of arthropods in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is not fully understood. Thus far, a few studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 replication is not supported in cells from certain insect species nor in certain species of mosquitoes after intrathoracic inoculation. In this study, we expanded the work of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to biting insects after ingesting a SARS-CoV-2infected blood meal. Species tested included Culicoides sonorensis biting midges, as well as Culex tarsalis and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, all known biological vectors for numerous RNA viruses. Arthropods were allowed to feed on SARS-CoV-2 spiked blood and at various time points post infection analyzed for the presence of viral RNA and infectious virus. Additionally, cell lines derived from C. sonorensis (W8a), Ae. aegypti (C6/36), Cx. quinquefasciatus (HSU), and Cx. tarsalis (CxTrR2) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. Our results indicate that none of the biting insects, nor the insect cell lines support SARS-CoV-2 replication. We conclude, that biting insect do not pose a risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans or animals following a SARS-CoV-2 infected blood meal.",

    "abstract": "The D614G substitution in the S protein is most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 strain circulating globally, but its effects in viral pathogenesis and transmission remain unclear. We engineered SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring the D614G substitution with or without nanoluciferase. The D614G variant replicates more efficiency in primary human proximal airway epithelial cells and is more fit than wildtype (WT) virus in competition studies. With similar morphology to the WT virion, the D614G virus is also more sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Infection of human ACE2 transgenic mice and Syrian hamsters with the WT or D614G viruses produced similar titers in respiratory tissue and pulmonary disease. However, the D614G variant exhibited significantly faster droplet transmission between hamsters than the WT virus, early after infection. Our study demonstrated the SARS-CoV2 D614G substitution enhances infectivity, replication fitness, and early transmission.",

    "abstract": "The current SARS-COV-2 epidemic is associated with nearly 1 million estimated deaths and responsible for multiple disturbances around the world, including the overload of health care systems. The timely prediction of the medical needs of infected individuals enables a better and quicker care provision for the necessary cases, supporting the management of available resources. This work ascertains the predictability of medical needs (as hospitalization, respiratory support, and admission to intensive care units) and the survivability of individuals testing SARS-CoV-2 positive considering a cohort with all infected individuals in Portugal as per June 30, 2020. Predictions are performed at the various stages of a patients cycle, namely: pre-hospitalization (testing time), pos-hospitalization, and pos-intensive care. A thorough optimization of state-of-the-art predictors is undertaken to assess the ability to anticipate medical needs and infection outcomes using demographic and comorbidity variables, as well as onset date of symptoms, test and hospitalization.",

    "abstract": "This study sought to provide an early description of mental health service activity before and after national implementation of social distancing for COVID-19. A time series analysis was carried out of daily service-level activity on data from a large mental healthcare provider in southeast London, from 01.02.2020 to 31.03.2020, comparing activity before and after 16.03.2020: i) inpatient admissions, discharges and numbers, ii) contact numbers and daily caseloads (Liaison, Home Treatment Teams, Community Mental Health Teams); iii) numbers of deaths for past and present patients. Daily face-to-face contact numbers fell for liaison, home treatment and community services with incomplete compensatory rises in non-face-to-face contacts. Daily caseloads fell for all services, apart from working age and child/adolescent community teams. Inpatient numbers fell 13.6% after 16th March, and daily numbers of deaths increased by 61.8%.",

    "abstract": "Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, daily counts of confirmed cases and deaths have been publicly reported in real-time to control the virus spread. However, substantial undocumented infections have obscured the true prevalence of the virus. A machine learning framework was developed to estimate time courses of actual new COVID-19 cases and current infections in 50 countries and 50 U.S. states from reported test results and deaths, as well as published epidemiological parameters. Severe under-reporting of cases was found to be universal. Our framework projects for countries like Belgium, Brazil, and the U.S. ~10% of the population has been once infected. In the U.S. states like Louisiana, Georgia, and Florida, more than 4% of the population is estimated to be currently infected, as of September 3, 2020, while in New York the fraction is 0.12%. The estimation of the actual fraction of currently infected people is crucial for any definition of public health policies, which up to this point may have been misguided by the reliance on confirmed cases.",

    "abstract": "The subset of patients who develop critical illness in Covid-19 have extensive inflammation affecting the lungs and are strikingly different from other patients: immunosuppressive therapy benefits critically-ill patients, but may harm some non-critical cases. Since susceptibility to life-threatening infections and immune-mediated diseases are both strongly heritable traits, we reasoned that host genetic variation may identify mechanistic targets for therapeutic development in Covid-19. GenOMICC (Genetics Of Mortality In Critical Care, genomicc.org) is a global collaborative study to understand the genetic basis of critical illness. Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 2790 critically-ill Covid-19 patients from 208 UK intensive care units (ICUs), representing >95% of all ICU beds. Random controls were drawn from three distinct UK population studies. We identify and replicate several novel genome-wide significant associations including variants chr19p13.3 (rs2109069, P = 3.98 x 10-12), within the gene encoding dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9), and at chr21q22.1 (rs2236757, P = 4.99 x 10-8) in the interferon receptor IFNAR2. Consistent with our focus on extreme disease in younger patients with less comorbidity, we detect a stronger signal at the known 3p21.31 locus than previous studies (rs73064425, P = 1.2 x 10-27). We identify potential targets for repurposing of existing licensed medications. Using Mendelian randomisation we found evidence in support of a causal link from low expression of IFNAR2, and high expression of TYK2, to life-threatening disease. Transcriptome-wide association in lung tissue revealed that high expression of the monocyte/macrophage chemotactic receptor CCR2 is associated with severe Covid-19. We detected genome-wide significant gene-level associations for genes with central roles in viral restriction (OAS1, OAS2, OAS3). These results identify specific loci associated with life-threatening disease, and potential targets for host-directed therapies. Randomised clinical trials will be necessary before any change to clinical practice.",

Recent studies show that vitamin D and its primary source Ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB) may play a protective role in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. However, the combined roles of the monsoon season and UVB in COVID-19 in India are still unclear. In this observational study, we empirically study the respective roles of monsoon season and UVB, whilst further exploring, whether monsoon season negatively impacts the protective role of UVB in COVID-19 deaths in India. Methods: We use a log-linear Mundlak model to a panel dataset of 36 administrative regions in India from 14 March 2020 - 8 August 2020 (n=4005). We use the cumulative COVID-19 deaths as the dependent variable. We isolate the association of monsoon season and UVB as measured by Ultraviolet Index (UVI) from other confounding time-constant and time-varying region-specific factors. Findings: After controlling for various confounding factors, we observe that the monsoon season and a unit increase in UVI are separately associated with 12.8 percentage points and 2.0 percentage points decline in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths in the long run. These associations translate into substantial relative changes. For example, the current monsoon season, that has been going on for two weeks, is associated with a reduction in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths of 59%, whereas a permanent unit increase of UVI is associated with a reduction in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths of 37%. However, the current monsoon season, also reduces the protective role of UVI by 16.3% [0.33 percentage points], plausibly due to lower UVB exposure. Interpretation: We find independent protective roles of both the monsoon season and UVI in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. Furthermore, we find evidence that monsoon season is associated with a significant reduction in the protective role of UVI. The protective role of monsoon season is plausibly due to limited outdoor activities of people. Our study outlines the role of the monsoon season and UVB in COVID-19 in India and supports health-related policy decision making in India.",

    "abstract": "Background and aims: This study investigated the clinical manifestations, outcomes and long-term complications of COVID-19 inpatients in Bangladesh while emphasizing on individuals having diabetes. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted for a sample of COVID-19 inpatients across four different hospitals of Bangladesh between April 1st and June 30, 2020. Variation in clinical characteristics, contact history, comorbidities, treatment pattern, and long-term complications were investigated. Results: There were 734 COVID-19 presentations in this study of which 19.8% of patients had diabetes. 76% were male and 85% of the patients had been administered with all vaccine doses during childhood. The most frequently occurring blood groups among patients with diabetes were B (+) ve (35%) and O (+) ve (31%). Among biochemical parameters, glucose, D-dimer, C- reactive protein (CRP) and Troponin levels were significantly elevated amidst the cohort with diabetes. The frequency of insulin dependent individuals increased three-fold during COVID-19. A number of COVID-19 patients with diabetes have been suffering from long term complications post recovery including pain, discomfort, memory loss and sleep disturbance. Conclusion: Individuals with diabetes have experienced severe manifestation of COVID-19 and post disease complications. Further in-depth studies focused on larger sample sizes are entailed to assess the relationships elaborately.",

    "abstract": "We are currently facing a pandemic of COVID-19, caused by a spillover from an animal-originating coronavirus to humans occuring in the Wuhan region, China, in December 2019. From China the virus has spread to 188 countries and regions worldwide, reaching the Sahel region on the 2nd of March 2020. Since whole genome sequencing (WGS) data is very crucial to understand the spreading dynamics of the ongoing pandemic, but only limited sequence data is available from the Sahel region to date, we have focused our efforts on generating the first Malian sequencing data available. Screening of 217 Malian patient samples for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in 38 positive isolates from which 21 whole genome sequences were generated. Our analysis shows that both, the early A (19B) and the fast evolving B (20A/C) clade, are present in Mali indicating multiple and independent introductions of the SARS-CoV-2 to the Sahel region.",

    "abstract": "Background: Qatar experienced a large severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic that disproportionately affected the craft and manual workers (CMWs) who constitute 60% of the population. This study aimed to investigate level of immunity in communities within this population as well as infection exposure required to achieve herd immunity. Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was assessed in ten CMW communities between June 21 and September 9, 2020. PCR positivity, infection positivity (antibody and/or PCR positive), and infection severity rate were also estimated. Associations with anti-SARS-CoV-2 positivity were investigated using regression analyses. Results: Study included 4,970 CMWs who were mostly men (95.0%) and <40 years of age (71.5%). Seropositivity ranged from 54.9% (95% CI: 50.2-59.4%) to 83.8% (95% CI: 79.1-87.7%) in the different CMW communities. Pooled mean seropositivity across all communities was 66.1% (95% CI: 61.5-70.6%). PCR positivity ranged from 0.0% to 10.5% (95% CI: 7.4-14.8%) in the different CMW communities. Pooled mean PCR positivity was 3.9% (95% CI: 1.6-6.9%). Median cycle threshold (Ct) value was 34.0 (range: 15.8-37.4). The majority (79.5%) of PCR-positive individuals had Ct value >30 indicative of earlier rather than recent infection. Infection positivity (antibody and/or PCR positive) ranged from 62.5% (95% CI: 58.3-66.7%) to 83.8% (95% CI: 79.1-87.7%) in the different CMW communities. Pooled mean infection positivity was 69.5% (95% CI: 62.8-75.9%). Only five infections were ever severe and one was ever critical, an infection severity rate of 0.2% (95% CI: 0.1-0.4%). Conclusions: Based on an extended range of epidemiological measures, active infection is rare in these communities with limited if any sustainable infection transmission for clusters to occur. At least some CMW communities in Qatar have reached or nearly reached herd immunity for SARS-CoV-2 infection at a proportion of ever infection of 65-70%.",

    "abstract": "The numbers of confirmed cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are increasing in many places. Consequently, the number of individuals placed into quarantine is increasing too. The large number of individuals in quarantine has high societal and economical costs. There is ongoing debate about the duration of quarantine, particularly since the fraction of individuals in quarantine who eventually test positive is perceived as being low. We present a mathematical model that uses empirically determined distributions of incubation period, infectivity, and generation time to quantify how the duration of quarantine affects transmission. We use this model to examine two quarantine scenarios: traced contacts of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and returning travellers. We quantify the impact of shortening the quarantine duration in terms of prevented transmission and the ratio of prevented transmission to days spent in quarantine. We also consider the impact of i) test-and-release strategies; ii) reinforced hygiene measures upon release after a negative test; iii) the development of symptoms during quarantine; iv) the relationship between quarantine duration and adherence; and v) the fraction of individuals in quarantine that are infected. When considering the ratio of prevented transmission to days spent in quarantine, we find that the diminishing impact of longer quarantine on transmission prevention may support a quarantine duration below 10 days. This ratio can be increased by implementing a test-and-release strategy, and this can be even further strengthened by reinforced hygiene measures post-release. We also find that unless a test-and-release strategy is considered, the fraction of individuals in quarantine that are infected does not affect the optimal duration of quarantine under our utility metric. Ultimately, we show that there are quarantine strategies based on a test-and-release protocol that, from an epidemiological viewpoint, perform almost as well as the standard 10 day quarantine, but with a lower cost in terms of person days spent in quarantine. This applies to both travellers and contacts, but the specifics depend on the context.",

    "abstract": "The mortality figures related to the coronavirus pandemic has been the topic of debate lately. Several hypothesis are made regarding the expected number of deaths in a region but there are various factors governing the same. In this paper, we have discussed the mortality figures in the Umbria region after analyzing the data from the national Health registry between December 2019 to April 2020; the period of infection and its comparison with the data from previous five years. The factors governing these figures were studied including temperature, standard mortality rates, territorial distribution, death due to all cases as well as the non-COVID deaths. A sharp increase in mortality figures was observed for the month of march and low temperature also had a role to play. However the difference when compared to previous 5 years was not significant as was expected at the start of the study. A single factor cannot be responsible for the total mortality figures in a region as is frequently predicted.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To assess health equity-oriented COVID-19 data reporting across Canadian provinces and territories, using a scorecard approach. Method: A scan was performed of provincial and territorial reporting of five data elements (cumulative totals of tests, cases, hospitalizations, deaths and population size) across three units of aggregation (province or territory-level, health regions, and local areas) (15 \"overall\" indicators), and for two vulnerable settings (long term care and detention facilities) and six social markers (age, sex, immigration status, race/ethnicity, essential worker status, and income) (120 \"equity-related\" indicators). Per indicator, one point was awarded if case-delimited data were released, 0.7 points if only summary statistics were reported, and 0 if neither was provided. Results were presented using a scorecard approach. Results: Overall, information on cases and deaths was more complete than for tests, hospitalizations and population size denominators needed for rate estimation. Information provided on jurisdictions and their regions, overall, tended to be more available (average score of 53%, \"B\") than for equity-related indicators (average score of 21%, \"D\"). Only British Columbia and Alberta provided case-delimited data, and only Alberta provided information for local areas. No jurisdiction reported on outcomes according to patients' individual-level immigration status, race, or income. Only Ontario and Quebec provided detailed information for long-term care settings and detention facilities. Conclusion: Socially stratified reporting for COVID-19 outcomes is sparse in Canada. However, several best practices in health equity-oriented reporting were observed and set a relevant precedent for all jurisdictions to follow for this pandemic and future ones.",

    "abstract": "Background: Brazil became the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic in a brief period of a few months after the first officially registered case. The knowledge of the epidemiological/clinical profile and the risk factors of Brazilian COVID-19 patients can assist in the decision making of physicians in the implementation of early and most appropriate measures for poor prognosis patients. However, these reports are missing. Here we present a comprehensive study that addresses this demand. Methods: This data-driven study was based on the Brazilian Ministry of Health Database (SIVEP-Gripe, 2020) regarding notified cases of hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the period from February 26 to August 10, 2020. Demographic data, clinical symptoms, comorbidities and other additional information of patients were analyzed. Results: The hospitalization rate was higher for male gender (56.56%) and for older age patients of both sexes. Overall, the mortality rate was quite high (41.28%) among hospitalized patients, especially those over 60 years of age. Most prevalent symptoms were cough, dyspnoea, fever, low oxygen saturation and respiratory distress. Heart disease, diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, neurological disease, and pneumopathy were the most prevalent comorbidities. A high prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with heart disease (65.7%) and diabetes (53.55%) and with a high mortality rate of around 50% was observed. The ICU admission rate was 39.37% and of these 62.4% died. 24.4% of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), with high mortality among them (82.98%). The main mortality risk predictors were older age and IMV requirement. In addition, socioeconomic conditions have been shown to significantly influence the disease outcome, regardless of age and comorbidities. Conclusion: Our study provides a comprehensive overview of the hospitalized Brazilian COVID-19 patients profile and the mortality risk factors. The analysis also evidenced that the disease outcome is influenced by multiple factors, as unequally affects different segments of population.",

Here, we provide a first report on the FeverIQ symptom tracker, a global effort to collect symptom and test data which has received more than 3.6 million submissions. Unlike other trackers, FeverIQ uses secure multiparty computation (SMC) to cryptographically guarantee user privacy while providing insights to scientists and public health efforts. We performed basic integrity checks of the FeverIQ dataset, such as by comparing it to other publicly released data. We then trained a linear classifier on diagnosis scores which were computed securely, without unprotected symptom data ever leaving a user's phone or computer. FeverIQ is currently the world's largest application of SMC in a health context, demonstrating the practicality of privacy-preserving analytics for population-scale digital health interventions.",

    "abstract": "Converging lines of evidence seem to indicate that SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, can be transmitted from person-to-person via aerosols that waft through the air and accumulate over time. The airborne nature of the virus could be a threat in indoor spaces in general and in particular for in-class education. We provide an assessment of the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection during a 7-hour school day in elementary schools. We show that existing data are insufficient to establish a low (below 1\\%) probability of infection with high accuracy. The use of facemasks and social distancing could significantly decrease this risk.",

    "abstract": "Background: Multiple studies have highlighted the negative impact of COVID-19 and its particular effects on vulnerable sub-populations. Complementing this work, here, we report on the social patterning of self-reported positive changes experienced during COVID-19 national lockdown in Scotland. Methods: The CATALYST study collected data from 3342 adults in Scotland during weeks 9-12 of a national lockdown. Participants completed an online questionnaire providing data on key sociodemographic and health variables, and completed a measure of positive change. The positive change measure spanned diverse domains (e.g., more quality time with family, developing new hobbies, more physical activity, and better quality of sleep). We used univariate analysis and stepwise regression to examine the contribution of a range of sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, educational attainment, and employment status) in explaining positive change. Results: There were clear sociodemographic differences across positive change scores. Those reporting higher levels of positive change were female, from younger age groups, married or living with their partner, employed, and in better health. Conclusion: Overall our results highlight the social patterning of positive changes during lockdown in Scotland. These findings begin to illuminate the complexity of the unanticipated effects of national lockdown and will be used to support future intervention development work sharing lessons learned from lockdown to increase positive health change amongst those who may benefit.",

    "abstract": "Background: The exponential growth of COVID-19 cases in Brazil is overloading health systems with overcrowding of hospitals and overflowing intensive care units. Increasing infection rates in health professionals can lead to the collapse of the health system and further worsen the pandemic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of IgM and IgG for SARS-CoV-2 in health workers in Sergipe, Brazil. Methods: The targeted tests involved health professionals working on the front line to combat COVID-19. The samples were collected in the month of June, in six hospital units in the state of Sergipe. Results: 471 health professionals were tested. Of these, 28 workers (5.95%) tested positive for IgM and 64 (13.59%) tested positive for IgG. 9 workers (1.91%) tested positive for IgM and were also positive for IgG. Discussion: Health workers must be monitored constantly, because if they are infected, they can spread the virus to colleagues, hospitalized patients and even family members. Conclusion: Knowing the prevalence of antibodies to the virus in health workers is an important measure of viral spread control. Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, Health workers, Immunofluorescence assays.",

    "abstract": "For the past 50 years, positive pressure ventilation has been a cornerstone of treatment for respiratory failure. Consensus surrounding the epidemiology of respiratory failure has permitted a relatively good fit between the supply of ventilators and the demand. However, the current COVID-19 pandemic has increased demand for mechanical ventilators well beyond supply. Respiratory failure complicates most critically ill patients with COVID-19 and is characterized by highly heterogeneous pulmonary parenchymal involvement, profound hypoxemia and pulmonary vascular injury. The profound increase in the incidence of respiratory failure has exposed critical shortages in the supply of mechanical ventilators, and those with the necessary skills to treat. While most traditional ventilators rely on an internal compressor and mixer to moderate and control the gas mixture delivered to a patient, the current emergency climate has catalyzed alternative designs that might enable greater flexibility in terms of supply chain, manufacturing, storage and maintenance. Design considerations of these 'emergency response' ventilators have generally fallen into two categories: those that rely on mechanical compression of a known volume of gas and those powered by an internal compressor to deliver time cycled pressure- or volume-limited gas to the patient. The present work introduces a low-cost, ventilator designed and built in accordance with the Emergence Use guidance provided by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) wherein an external gas supply feeds into the ventilator and time limited flow interruption guarantees tidal volume. The goal of this device is to allow a patient to be treated by a single ventilator platform, capable of supporting the various treatment paradigms during a potential COVID-19 related hospitalization. This is a unique aspect of this design as it attempts to become a one-device-one-visit solution to the problem. The device is designed as a single use ventilator that is sufficiently robust to treat a patient being mechanically ventilated. The overall design philosophy and its applicability in this new crisis-laden world view is first described, followed by both bench top and animal testing results used to confirm the precision, capability, safety and reliability of this low cost and novel approach to mechanical ventilation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ventilator is shown to perform in a range of critical requirements listed in the FDA emergency regulations and can safely and effectively ventilate a porcine subject. As of August 2020, only 13 emergency ventilators have been authorized by the FDA, and this work represents the first to publish animal data using the ventilator. This proof-of-concept provides support for this cost-effective, readily mass-produced ventilator that can be used to support patients when the demand for ventilators outstrips supply in hospital settings worldwide.

    "abstract": "IntroductionCOVID-19 pandemic is a global public health threat facing mankind. There is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19, and no vaccine is currently available. This study aimed to understand the perception of the public towards a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria.\n\nMethodWe conducted a cross-sectional survey in August 2020 across the 36 states of Nigeria using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire includes sections on the demographic characteristics of the respondents and their perception regarding a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 517 respondents completed and returned the informed consent along with the questionnaire electronically. Data were coded and abstracted into the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and loaded into the STATA 14 software for final analysis.\n\nResultsThe results showed that more than half of the respondents were male 294 (56.9%). Most of the respondents (385, 74.5%) intend to take the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available. Among the 132 respondents that would not take the COVID-19 vaccine, the major reason for non-acceptance was unreliability of the clinical trials 49 (37.1%), followed by the belief that their immune system was sufficient to combat the virus 36 (27.3%). There were significant association between the age of the respondents and the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (P-value=0.00) as well as geographical location and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (P-value=0.02).\n\nConclusionIt was observed that most of the respondents were willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine. Our findings reiterate the need to reassure the public that any vaccine that becomes available will be safe and effective. In addition, there is a need for the national health authorities to ensure the public trust is earned and all communities, including the marginalized populations, are engaged properly to ensure an optimal COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.",

    "abstract": "We estimate the impact of mask mandates and other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) on COVID-19 case growth in Canada, including regulations on businesses and gatherings, school closures, travel and self-isolation, and long-term care homes. We partially account for behavioral responses using Google mobility data. Our identification approach exploits variation in the timing of indoor face mask mandates staggered over two months in the 34 public health regions in Ontario, Canada's most populous province. We find that, in the first few weeks after implementation, mask mandates are associated with a reduction of 25 percent in the weekly number of new COVID-19 cases. Additional analysis with province-level data provides corroborating evidence. Counterfactual policy simulations suggest that mandating indoor masks nationwide in early July could have reduced the weekly number of new cases in Canada by 25 to 40 percent in mid-August, which translates into 700 to 1,100 fewer cases per week.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this review was to summarise the effects of different personal protective equipment (PPE) for reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection in health personnel caring for patients undergoing trauma surgery. The purpose of the review was to inform recommendations for rational use of PPE for emergency surgery staff, particularly in low resources environments where PPE shortages and high costs are expected to hamper the safety of healthcare workers (HCWs) and affect the care of trauma patients. Introduction: Many healthcare facilities in low-and middle-income countries are inadequately resourced. COVID-19 has the potential to decimate these already strained surgical healthcare services unless health systems take stringent measures to protect healthcare workers from viral exposure. Inclusion criteria: This review included systematic reviews, experimental and observational studies evaluating the effect of different PPE on the risk of COVID-19 infection in HCWs involved in emergency trauma surgery. Indirect evidence from other healthcare settings was considered, as well as evidence from other viral outbreaks summarised and discussed for the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted searches in the LOVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs automated regular searches in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and over thirty other sources. The risk of bias assessment of the included studies was planned with the AMSTAR II tool for systematic reviews, the RoBII tool for randomised controlled trials, and the ROBINS-I tool for non-randomised studies. Data were extracted using a standardised data extraction tool and summarised narratively. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for grading the certainty of the evidence was followed. Results: We identified 17 systematic reviews that fulfilled our selection criteria and were included for synthesis. We did not identify randomised controlled trials during COVID-19 or studies additional to those included in the reviews that discussed other similar viral respiratory illnesses. Conclusions: The use of PPE drastically reduces the risk of COVID-19 compared with no mask use in HCWs in the hospital setting. N95 and N95 equivalent respirators provided more protection and were found to halve the risk of COVID-19 contagion in HCWs from moderate and high-risk environments. Eye protection also offers additional security and is associated with reduced incidence of contagion. These effects apply to emergency trauma care. Decontamination and reuse appear as feasible, cost-effective measures that would likely help overcome PPE shortages and enhance the allocation of limited resources. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS There is high certainty that the use of N95 respirators and surgical masks are associated with a reduced risk of coronaviruses respiratory illness when compared with no mask use. In moderate to high-risk environments, especially in aerosol-generating procedures, N95 respirators are associated with a more significant reduction in risk of COVID-19 infection compared with surgical masks. Eye protection also reduces the risk of contagion. Decontamination of masks and respirators with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, vaporous hydrogen peroxide, or dry heat is effective and does not affect PPE performance or fit.",

    "abstract": "The global COVID-19 pandemic is predicted to compromise the achievement of global reproductive, maternal and newborn health (RMNH) targets. The objective of this study was to determine the health facility (HF) preparedness for RMNH service delivery during the outbreak from the perspective of RMNH providers and to determine what factors significantly predict this. An anonymous cross-sectional online survey of RMNH providers was conducted from 1st to 21st July 2020 in Lagos state Nigeria. We conducted a descriptive and ordinal regression analysis, with RMNH worker perception of HF preparedness for RMNH service delivery during the outbreak as the dependent variable. Two hundred and fifty-six RMNH workers participated, 35.2% reported that RMNH services were unavailable at some time since March 2020, 39% felt moderate or extreme work-related burnout, 84% were moderately or extremely concerned about the availability of PPE and related guidelines, and only 11.7% were extremely satisfied with the preparedness of their HFs. Our final model was a statistically significant predictor of RMNH worker perception of HF preparedness explaining 54.7% of the variation in the outcome variable. A one-unit increase in the level of satisfaction with the communication from HF management and level of concern about the availability of PPE and COVID-19 guidelines would increase the odds of observing a higher category of satisfaction with HF COVID-19 preparedness (OR 0.79-2.92, p<0.001 and 0.02-0.15 p<0.001 respectively). Adequate support of RMNH providers particularly provision of PPE and guidelines, appropriate communications about COVID-19 should be prioritised as part of health system preparedness.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is an extremely dangerous disease that not only spreads quickly, but is also characterized by a high mortality rate. Therefore, predicting the number of deaths from the new coronavirus is an urgent task. The aim of the study is to analyze the factors affecting COVID-19 mortality rate in various countries, to predict direct and indirect victims of the pandemic in the Russian Federation, and to estimate additional mortality during the pandemic based on the demographic data. The main research method is econometric modeling. Comparison of various data was also applied. The authors' calculations were based on data from the RSSS, the World Bank, as well as specialized sites with coronavirus statistics in Russia and in the world. A predictive estimation of the deceased number of people due to the pandemic in Russia was made. It is confirmed that the deaths proportion of the completed cases of the disease depends on the level of testing. It is shown that the revealed mortality of the disease depends on the proportion of completed cases, on the population age structure, and on how early the pandemic entered the country compared to the other countries. It is determined that the number of additional deaths due to the coronavirus is approximately 31 thousand people. The analysis revealed that the relatively low proportion of COVID in Russia is the result of a special approach to the cause of death determination. The mortality rate in Russia in April 2020 was about 3% higher than in April 2019. The share of the deceased health workers in the total coronavirus mortality in the Russian Federation is higher than in the developed countries, which indicates an underestimation of the data on COVID- 19 deaths in the Russian Federation, and the unsatisfactory quality of the Russian healthcare system. The number of direct and indirect victims of the pandemic in the Russian Federation at the end of July was approximately 43 thousand people.",

    "abstract": "Novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has reached 28 million cases worldwide in eight months. The serological detection of antibodies against the virus will play a pivotal role in complementing molecular tests to improve diagnostic accuracy, contact tracing, vaccine efficacy testing and seroprevalence surveillance. Here, we aimed first to evaluate a lateral flow assays ability to identify specific IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and second, to report the seroprevalence of these antibodies among health care workers and healthy volunteer blood donors in Panama. We recruited study participants between April 30th and July 7th, 2020. For the test validation and performance evaluation, we analyzed serum samples from participants with clinical symptoms and confirmed positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, and a set of pre-pandemic serum samples. We used two by two table analysis to determine the test sensitivity and specificity as well as the kappa agreement value with a 95% confidence interval. Then, we used the lateral flow assay to determine seroprevalence among serum samples from COVID-19 patients, potentially exposed health care workers, and healthy volunteer donors. Our results show this assay reached a positive percent agreement of 97.2% (95% CI 84.2-100.0%) for detecting both IgM and IgG. The assay showed a kappa of 0.898 (95%CI 0.811-0.985) and 0.918 (95% CI 0.839-0.997) for IgM and IgG, respectively. The evaluation of serum samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients indicates a correlation between test sensitivity and the number of days since symptom onset; the highest positive percent agreement (87% (95% CI 67.0-96.3%)) was observed at [&ge;]15 days post-symptom onset. We found an overall antibody seroprevalence of 11.6% (95% CI 8.5-15.8%) among both health care workers and healthy blood donors. Our findings suggest this lateral flow assay could contribute significantly to implementing seroprevalence testing in locations with active community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Significant barriers to the diagnosis of latent and acute SARS-CoV-2 infection continue to hamper population-based screening efforts required to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in the absence of effective antiviral therapeutics or vaccines. We report an aptamer-based SARS-CoV-2 salivary antigen assay employing only low-cost reagents ($3.20/test) and an off-the-shelf glucometer. The test was engineered around a glucometer as it is quantitative, easy to use, and the most prevalent piece of diagnostic equipment globally making the test highly scalable with an infrastructure that is already in place. Furthermore, many glucometers connect to smartphones providing an opportunity to integrate with contract tracing apps, medical providers, and electronic medical records. In clinical testing, the developed assay detected SARS-CoV-2 infection in patient saliva across a range of viral loads - as benchmarked by RT-qPCR - within one hour, with 100% sensitivity (positive percent agreement) and distinguished infected specimens from off-target antigens in uninfected controls with 100% specificity (negative percent agreement). We propose that this approach can provide an inexpensive, rapid, and accurate diagnostic for distributed screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection at scale.",

    "abstract": "Background: COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on ethnic minority populations, both in the UK and internationally. To date, much of the evidence has been derived from studies within single healthcare settings, mainly those hospitalised with COVID-19. Working on behalf of NHS England, the aim of this study was to identify ethnic differences in the risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation and mortality using a large general population cohort in England. Methods: We conducted an observational cohort study using linked primary care records of 17.5 million adults between 1 February 2020 and 3 August 2020. Exposure was self-reported ethnicity collapsed into the 5 and 16 ethnicity categories of the English Census. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify ethnic differences in the risk of being tested and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 related intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and COVID-19 mortality, adjusted for socio-demographic factors, clinical co-morbidities, geographic region, care home residency, and household size. Results: A total of 17,510,002 adults were included in the study; 63% white (n=11,030,673), 6% south Asian (n=1,034,337), 2% black (n=344,889), 2% other (n=324,730), 1% mixed (n=172,551), and 26% unknown (n=4,602,822). After adjusting for measured explanatory factors, south Asian, black, and mixed groups were marginally more likely to be tested (south Asian HR 1.08, 95%CI 1.07-1.09; black HR 1.08; 95%CI 1.06-1.09, mixed HR 1.03, 95%CI 1.01-1.05), and substantially more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with white adults (south Asian HR 2.02. 95% CI 1.97-2.07; black HR 1.68, 95%CI 1.61-1.76; mixed HR 1.46, 95%CI 1.36-1.56). The risk of being admitted to ICU for COVID-19 was substantially increased in all ethnic minority groups compared with white adults (south Asian HR 2.22, 95%CI 1.96-2.52; black HR 3.07, 95%CI 2.61-3.61; mixed HR 2.86, 95%CI 2.19-3.75, other HR 2.86, 95%CI 2.31-3.63). Risk of COVID-19 mortality was increased by 25-56% in ethnic minority groups compared with white adults (south Asian HR 1.27, 95%CI 1.17-1.38; black HR 1.55, 95%CI 1.38-1.75; mixed HR 1.40, 95%CI 1.12-1.76; other HR 1.25, 95%CI 1.05-1.49). We observed heterogeneity of associations after disaggregation into detailed ethnic groupings; Indian and African groups were at higher risk of all outcomes; Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Caribbean groups were less or equally likely to be tested for SARS-CoV-2, but at higher risk of all other outcomes, Chinese groups were less likely to be tested for and test positive for SARS-CoV-2, more likely to be admitted to ICU, and equally likely to die from COVID-19. Conclusions: We found evidence of substantial ethnic inequalities in the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, ICU admission, and mortality, which persisted after accounting for explanatory factors, including household size. It is likely that some of this excess risk is related to factors not captured in clinical records such as occupation, experiences of structural discrimination, or inequitable access to health and social services. Prioritizing linkage between health, social care, and employment data and engaging with ethnic minority communities to better understand their lived experiences is essential for generating evidence to prevent further widening of inequalities in a timely and actionable manner.",

    "abstract": "Self-contamination during doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE) is a concern for healthcare workers (HCW) following SARS-CoV-2 positive patient care. Staff may subconsciously become contaminated through improper glove removal, so quantifying this risk is critical for safe working procedures. HCW surface contact sequences on a respiratory ward were modelled using a discrete-time Markov chin for: IV-drip care, blood pressure monitoring and doctors' rounds. Accretion of viral RNA on gloves during care was modelled using a stochastic recurrence relation. The HCW then doffed PPE and contaminated themselves in a fraction of cases based on increasing case load. The risk of infection from this exposure was quantified using a dose-response methodology. A parametric study was conducted to analyse the effect of: 1a) increasing patient numbers on the ward, 1b) the proportion of COVID-19 cases, 2) the length of a shift and 3) the probability of touching contaminated PPE. The driving factors for infection risk were surface contamination and number of surface contacts. HCWs on a 100% COVID-19 ward were less than 2-fold more at risk than on a 50% COVID ward (1.6% vs 1%), whilst on a 5% COVID-19 ward, the risk dropped to 0.1% per shift (sd=0.6%). IV-drip care resulted in higher risk than blood pressure monitoring (1.1% vs 1% p<0.0001), whilst doctors' rounds produced a 0.6% risk (sd=0.8%). Recommendations include supervised PPE doffing procedures such as the \"doffing buddy\" scheme, maximising hand hygiene compliance post-doffing and targeted surface cleaning for surfaces away from the patient vicinity.",

    "abstract": "There is an urgent need to answer questions related to COVID-19's clinical course and associations with underlying conditions and health outcomes. Multi-center data are necessary to generate reliable answers, but centralizing data in a single repository is not always possible. Using a privacy-protecting strategy, we launched a public Questions & Answers web portal (https://covid19questions.org) with analyses of comorbidities, medications and laboratory tests using data from 202 hospitals (59,074 COVID-19 patients) in the USA and Germany. We find, for example, that 8.6% of hospitalizations in which the patient was not admitted to the ICU resulted in the patient returning to the hospital within seven days from discharge and that, when adjusted for age, mortality for hospitalized patients was not significantly different by gender or ethnicity.",

    "abstract": "Defensins, crucial components of the innate immune system, play a vital role against infection as part of frontline immunity. Association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with defensins has not been investigated till date. In this study, we have investigated the expression of defensin genes in the buccal cavity during COVID-19 infection. Nasopharyngeal/Oropharyngeal swab samples collected for screening SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed for the expression of major defensin genes by the quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, qRT-PCR. 40 SARS-CoV-2 infected positive and 40 negative swab samples were selected for the study. Based on the RT-PCR analysis involving gene specific primer for defensin genes, 10 defensin genes were found to be expressed in the Nasopharyngeal/Oropharyngeal cavity. Six defensin genes were further found to be significantly downregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients as against the control, negative samples based on differential expression analysis. The genes significantly downregulated were defensin beta 4A, 4B, 106B, 107B, 103A and defensin alpha 1B. Downregulation of several defensin genes suggests that innate immunity provided by defensins is or may be compromised in SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting in progression of the disease caused by the virus. Upregulation of defensin gene expression and use of defensin peptides could be attractive therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Many countries have implemented strict social distancing measures in the hope of reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 but the effectiveness of these measures is determined by the willingness of populations to comply with restrictions. Consequently, a system of monitoring population movement using existing data sources can inform those making decisions about policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe a collaboration with all 3 major domestic telecommunication companies in Hungary to use aggregated anonymous mobile phone usage data to calculate two indices for assessing the effect of movement restrictions: a \"mobility-index\" and a \"stay-at-home (or resting) index\". The strengths and weaknesses of this approach are compared with the smartphone-based, COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports from Google. Data generated by mobile phones have long been identified as a potential means to analyse mass population movement, but its operationalisation raises several technical questions, such as making sense of Call Detail Records, collation of data from different mobile network providers, and personal data protection concerns. The method described here addresses these issues and offers an effective and inexpensive tool to monitor the impact of social distancing measures, achieving high levels of accuracy and resolution. Especially in populations where uptake of smartphones is modest, this method has certain advantages over app-based solutions, with greater population coverage, but it is not an alternative to smartphone-based solutions used for contact tracing and quarantine monitoring. We believe that this method can easily be adapted by other countries.",

    "abstract": "During early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, forecasts provided actionable information about disease transmission to public health decision-makers. Between February and May 2020, experts in infectious disease modeling made weekly predictions about the impact of the pandemic in the U.S. We aggregated these predictions into consensus predictions. In March and April 2020, experts predicted that the number of COVID-19 related deaths in the U.S. by the end of 2020 would be in the range of 150,000 to 250,000, with scenarios of near 1m deaths considered plausible. The wide range of possible future outcomes underscored the uncertainty surrounding the outbreak's trajectory. Experts' predictions of measurable short-term outcomes had varying levels of accuracy over the surveys but showed appropriate levels of uncertainty when aggregated. An expert consensus model can provide important insight early on in an emerging global catastrophe.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by striking variability in clinical severity, and a hyperinflammatory response in the lung is associated with high mortality. Little is known about the extent and duration of inflammation in persons recovering from COVID-19. Here, we used spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) to detect the presence of inflammatory cells in the vitreous cavity, an immune-privileged microenvironment, in persons recovered from COVID- 19. Our results provide quasi-histologic evidence that neuroinflammation is present in persons who recovered from COVID-19, only one of whom required hospitalization. Our results also suggest that persons who feel that their recovery is incomplete have evidence of subclinical eye inflammation, which may be a marker of residual inflammation elsewhere as well.",

    "abstract": "To understand SARS-CoV-2 immunity after natural infection or vaccination, functional assays such as virus neutralizing assays are needed. So far, assays to determine SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies rely on cell-culture based infection assays either using wild type SARS-CoV-2 or pseudotyped viruses. Such assays are labour-intensive, require appropriate biosafety facilities and are difficult to standardize. Recently, a new surrogate virus neutralisation assay (sVNT) was described that uses the principle of an ELISA to measure the neutralization capacity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies directed against the receptor binding domain. Here, we performed an independent evaluation of the robustness, specificity and sensitivity on an extensive panel of sera from 269 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 259 unmatched samples collected before 2020 and compared it to cell-based neutralization assays. We found a high specificity of 99.2 (95%CI: 96.9-99.9) and overall sensitivity of 80.3 (95%CI: 74.9-84.8) for the sVNT. Clinical sensitivity increased between early (<14 days post symptom onset or post diagnosis, dpos/dpd) and late sera (>14 dpos/dpd) from 75.0 (64.7-83.2) to 83.1 (76.5-88.1). Also, higher severity was associated with an increase in clinical sensitivity. Upon comparison with cell-based neutralisation assays we determined an analytical sensitivity of 74.3 (56.4-86.9) and 98.2 (89.4-99.9) for titres [&ge;]10 to <40 and [&ge;]40 to <160, respectively. Only samples with a titre [&ge;]160 were always positive in the sVNT. In conclusion, the sVNT can be used as an additional assay to determine the immune status of COVID-19 infected of vaccinated individuals but its value needs to be assessed for the specific context of use.",

    "abstract": "In limelight of the ongoing pandemic SARS-CoV-2 testing is critical for the diagnosis of infected patients, contact-tracing and mitigating the transmission. Diagnostic laboratories are expected to provide appropriate testing with maximum accuracy. Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) is the diagnostic standard yet many commercial diagnostic kits have become available. However, only a handful of studies have reviewed their performance in clinical settings. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of the overall analytical matrix including the extraction kit (BD MAX, Promega, Qiagen), the PCR instrument (Agilent Mx3005P, BD MAX, Qiagen Rotor-Gene, Roche Cobas z 480) and the RT-PCR assay (Altona Diagnostics, CerTest Biotec, R-Biopharm AG) using predefined samples from proficiency testing organizers. The greatest difference of the Ct values between the matrices was 9 cycles. One borderline sample could not be detected by 3 out of 12 analytical matrices and yielded a false negative result. We therefore conclude that diagnostic laboratories should take the complete analytical matrix in addition to the performance values published by the manufacturer for a respective RT-PCR kit into account. With limited resources laboratories have to validate a wide range of kits to determine appropriate analytical matrices for detecting SARS-CoV-2 reliably. The interpretation of clinical results has to be adapted accordingly.",

This presents a transmission cycle for the human infection that can be broken by developing new inactivation approaches. We employed an efficient cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) with argon feed gas to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 on various surfaces including plastic, metal, cardboard, basketball composite leather, football leather, and baseball leather. These results demonstrate the great potential of CAP as a safe and effective means to prevent virus transmission and infections.",

    "abstract": "Background: A substantial proportion of critically ill COVID-19 patients develop thromboembolic complications, but it is unclear whether higher doses of thromboprophylaxis are associated with lower mortality rates. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the association of initial dosing strategy of thromboprophylaxis in critically ill COVID-19 patients and the risk of death, thromboembolism, and bleeding. Method: All critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to two intensive care units in March and April 2020 were eligible. Patients were categorized into three groups according to initial daily dose of thromboprophylaxis: low (2500-4500 IU tinzaparin or 2500-5000 IU dalteparin), medium (>4500 IU but <175 IU/kilogram, kg, of body weight tinzaparin or >5000 IU but <200 IU/kg of body weight dalteparin), and high dose ([&ge;] 175 IU/kg of body weight tinzaparin or [&ge;]200 IU/kg of body weight dalteparin). Thromboprophylaxis dosage was based on local standardized recommendations, not on degree of critical illness or risk of thrombosis. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals of death within 28 days from ICU admission. Multivariable models were adjusted for sex, age, body-mass index, Simplified Acute Physiology Score III, invasive respiratory support, and initial dosing strategy of thromboprophylaxis. Results: A total of 152 patients were included; 67 received low, 48 medium, and 37 high dose thromboprophylaxis. Baseline characteristics did not differ between groups. Mortality was lower in high (13.5%) vs medium (25.0%) and low dose thromboprophylaxis (38.8%) groups, p{equiv}0.02. The hazard ratio of death was 0.33 (95% confidence intervals 0.13 - 0.87) among those who received high dose, respectively 0.88 (95% confidence intervals 0.43 - 1.83) among those who received medium dose, as compared with those who received low dose thromboprophylaxis. There were fewer thromboembolic events in the high (2.7%) vs medium (18.8%) and low dose thromboprophylaxis (17.9%) groups, p{equiv}0.04, but no difference in the proportion of bleeding events, p{equiv}0.16. Conclusions: Among critically ill COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure, high dose thromboprophylaxis was associated with a lower risk of death and a lower cumulative incidence of thromboembolic events compared with lower doses.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The current study seeks to understand the links between social media use and alcohol consumption during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Data were from the national Understanding American Study, a probability-based Internet panel weighted to represent the U.S. population. Subjects (N=5874; 51% female) were adults, 18 years and older, who completed a March survey (wave 1) and a follow-up survey one month later (wave 3). Analyses assessed the relationship of social media use at wave 1 with wave 3 alcohol use, accounting for wave 1 alcohol use and the socio-demographic characteristics of the sample. We examined the effect of working or studying from home as a moderator. Results: Twitter and Instagram users, but not Facebook users, drank more frequently at wave 3 than non-users. For Instagram users, more frequent alcohol use at wave 3 was at least partially attributed to the frequency of drinking at wave 1. The interaction between Twitter use and working or studying from home was statistically significant. The combination of being on Twitter and working or studying from home was associated with drinking more days a week. Conclusions: Exposure to content about COVID-19 and increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic may contribute to more frequent alcohol use for some social media users, especially those sheltering at home. The study of public health messaging via social media to change alcohol use behaviors during traumatic events is warranted.",

    "abstract": "The clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections can range from asymptomatic to lethal, and is thought to be crucially shaped by the quality of the immune response which includes antibody titres and affinity for their targets. Using Microfluidic Antibody Affinity Profiling (MAAP), we determined the aggregate affinities and concentrations of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in plasma samples of 42 seropositive individuals, 23 of whom were confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2-positive by PCR testing. We found that dissociation constants (Kd) of anti-RBD antibodies spanned more than two orders of magnitude from 80 pM to 25 nM, despite having similar antibody concentrations. Individual patients showed progressively higher antibody concentrations but constant Kd values, suggesting that affinities did not mature over time. 33 sera showed affinities higher than that of the CoV2 spike for its ACE2 receptor. Accordingly, addition of seropositive plasma to pre-formed spike-ACE2 receptor complexes led to their dissociation. Finally, we observed that the RBD of HKU1, OC43, and SARS-CoV coronaviruses, but not unrelated control proteins, were able to compete substantially with the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 in solution. Therefore, the affinity of total plasma immunoglobulins to SARS-CoV-2 is an indicator of the quality of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and may help select the most efficacious samples for therapeutic plasmapheresis.",

    "abstract": "Background Children are relatively protected from novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19). The reasons for this protection are not well understood but differences in the immune response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been implicated. If such differences are due to differential exposure to non-SARS-CoV-2 infectious agents, adults who are close contacts of children may partly share in this protection. Such a protective effect would have important implications for the lives of children, not least in terms of schooling. Methods Using a Scotland-wide record-linkage based occupational cohort comprising healthcare workers and members of their households, we examined whether sharing a household with young children (aged 0 to 11) attenuated the risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19, and/or testing positive for COVID-19 infection of any severity (any case of Covid-19). All healthcare workers directly employed by the National health Service (NHS) in Scotland, or contracted to provide general practice services, were included. Outcome and covariate data were obtained via linkage to Scotland-wide microbiology, drug prescribing, hospitalisation and death data. Results 241,266 adults did not share a household with young children; 41,198, 23,783 and 3,850 shared a household with 1, 2 and 3 or more young children respectively. The risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19 was lower in those with one child and lower still in those with two or more children, adjusting for age the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.83 per child (95% CI 0.70-0.99). On additionally adjusting for sex, socioeconomic deprivation, occupation, professional role, staff/non-staff status, the number of adults and adolescents in each household, and comorbidity, the HR was 0.89 per child (95% CI 0.74-1.06). An association of the same magnitude, but more precisely estimated, was obtained for any case of COVID-19 (fully adjusted model, HR per child 0.89; 95% CI 0.84-0.95). Conclusion Increased household exposure to young children was associated with an attenuated risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and appeared to also be associated with an attenuated risk of COVID-19 disease severe enough to require hospitalisation.",

    "abstract": "Background: The COVID 19 pandemic was associated with social restrictions in the UK from 16th March 2020. It was unclear if the lockdown period was associated with differences in the case-mix of non-COVID acute medical admissions compared with the previous year. Methods: Retrospective data were collected for 1st to 30th April 2019 and 1st to 30th April 2020 from University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, one of the largest hospitals in the UK with over 2 million patient contacts per year. The latter time period was chosen to coincide with the peak of COVID-19 cases in the West Midlands. All patients admitted under acute medicine during these time periods were included. COVID-19 was confirmed by SARS-Cov-2 swab or a probable case of COVID-19 based on World Health Organization diagnostic parameters. Non-COVID patients were those with a negative SARS-Cov-2 swab and no suspicion of COVID-19. Data was sourced from the UHB in-house electronic health system (EHS). Results: The total number of acute medical admissions fell comparing April 2019 (n=2409) to April 2020 (n=1682). As a proportion of total admissions, those aged under 45 years decreased, while those aged 46 and over did not change. The number of admissions due to psychiatric conditions and overdoses was higher in April 2020 (p < 0.001). When viewed as a proportion of admissions, alcohol-related admissions (p = 0.004), psychiatric conditions and overdoses (p<0.001) increased in April 2020 than in April 2019. The proportion of patients who were in hospital due to falls also increased in April 2020 (p<0.001). In the same period, the absolute number and the proportion of admissions that were due to non-specific chest pain, to musculoskeletal complaints and patients who self-discharged prior to assessment decreased (p=0.02, p=0.01 and p = 0.002 respectively). There were no significant differences in non-COVID-related intensive care admissions or mortality between the same months in the two years. Conclusion: In this large, single-centre study, there was a change in hospitalised case-mix when comparing April 2019 with April 2020: an increase in conditions which potentially reflect social isolation (falls, drug and alcohol misuse and psychiatric illness) and a decrease in conditions which rarely require in-patient hospital treatment (musculoskeletal pain and non-cardiac chest pain) especially among younger adults. These results highlight two areas for further research; the impact of social isolation on health and whether younger adults could be offered alternative health services to avoid potentially unnecessary hospital assessment.",

    "abstract": "Background: Access to health services and adequate care is influenced by sex, ethnicity, socio-economic position (SEP) and burden of co-morbidities. However, it is unknown whether the COVID-19 pandemic further deepened these already existing health inequalities. Methods: Participants were from five longitudinal age-homogenous British cohorts (born in 2001, 1990, 1970, 1958 and 1946). A web and telephone-based survey provided data on cancelled surgical or medical appointments, and the number of care hours received during the UK COVID-19 national lockdown. Using binary or ordered logistic regression, we evaluated whether these outcomes differed by sex, ethnicity, SEP and having a chronic illness. Adjustment was made for study-design, non-response weights, psychological distress, presence of children or adolescents in the household, keyworker status, and whether participants had received a shielding letter. Meta-analyses were performed across the cohorts and meta-regression evaluated the effect of age as a moderator. Findings: 14891 participants were included. Females (OR 1.40, 95% confidence interval [1.27,1.55]) and those with a chronic illness (OR 1.84 [1.65-2.05]) experienced significantly more cancellations during lockdown (all p<0.0001). Ethnic minorities and those with a chronic illness required a higher number of care hours during the lockdown (both OR approx. 2.00, all p<0.002). Age was not independently associated with either outcome in meta-regression. SEP was not associated with cancellation or care hours. Interpretation: The UK government's lockdown approach during the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have deepened existing health inequalities, impacting predominantly females, ethnic-minorities and those with chronic illnesses. Public health authorities need to implement urgent policies to ensure equitable access to health and care for all in preparation for a second wave.",

Furthermore, sex differences characterize the frequency and severity of pharmacological side effects. A large number of clinical trials are ongoing to develop new therapeutic approaches and vaccines for COVID-19.

Only 416 (16.7%) of the 2,484 registered SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 trials mention sex/gender as recruitment criterion and only 103 (4.1%) allude to sex/gender in the description of the analysis phase. None of the 11 clinical trials published in scientific journals on June 2020 reported sex-disaggregated results. Hence, lack of consideration upon registration does not seem to be corrected during trial execution and reporting. Given the biological relevance and the potential risks of unwanted side effects, we urge researchers to focus on sex-disaggregated analyses already at the planning stage of COVID-19 trials.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 ravage the world with wide variations in morbidity and mortality that have remained largely unexplained, even by mutations in protein coding regions. In this study, we analyzed available complete SARS-CoV-2 sequences using the CpG index as a signature of Zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) activity to examine population variations in innate intracellular antiviral competencies. The result suggests that differential ZAP activity may be a major determinant of the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Africa, Asia, and pools of asymptomatic patients had I_CpG signature evidence of high ZAP activity, while SARS-CoV-2 sequences from North America and Intensive Care Unit or Deceased patients had I_CpG signature of low ZAP activity. ZAP activity is linked to the interferon system. Low ZAP activity may be part of the explanation for the increased morbidity of SARS-CoV-2 in the elderly and with comorbidities like diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. It may also provide some insight into the discrepancies between invitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities of candidate therapies and performance in clinical trials. Furthermore, our results suggest that asymptomatic patients may paradoxically shed a more dangerous virus.",

    "abstract": "The lockdown and social distancing policy imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have a widespread impact on mental healthcare for both services themselves and the people accessing those services. Previous reports from the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in South London) highlighted a shift to virtual contacts among those accessing community mental health and home treatment teams and an increase in deaths over the pandemic first wave. However, there is a need to understand this further for specific groups, including those diagnosed with a personality disorder who might have particular vulnerabilities. Taking advantage of the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource with 24-hourly updates of electronic mental health records data, this paper describes daily caseloads and contact numbers (face-to-face and virtual) for individuals with personality disorders across community, specialist, crisis and inpatient services. The report focussed on the period 1st January to 31st May 2020. We also report on daily accepted and discharged trust referrals, total trust caseloads and daily inpatient admissions and discharges for individuals with personality disorders. In addition, daily deaths are described for all current and previous SLaM service users with personality disorder over this period. In summary, comparing periods before and after 16th March 2020 there was a shift from face-to-face contacts to virtual contacts across all teams. Liaison and Older Adult teams showed the largest drop in caseloads, whereas Early Intervention in Psychosis service caseloads remained the same. Reduced accepted referrals and inpatient admissions were observed and there was a 28% increase in average daily deaths in the period after 16th March, compared to the period 1st January to 15th March.",

    "abstract": "Background: Emerging evidence suggests that socially vulnerable communities are at higher risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks in the United States. However, no prior studies have examined temporal trends and differential effects of social vulnerability on COVID-19 incidence and death rates. The purpose of this study was to examine temporal trends among counties with high and low social vulnerability and to quantify disparities in these trends over time. We hypothesized that highly vulnerable counties would have higher incidence and death rates compared to less vulnerable counties and that this disparity would widen as the pandemic progressed. Methods: We conducted a retrospective longitudinal analysis examining COVID-19 incidence and death rates from March 1 to August 31, 2020 for each county in the US. We obtained daily COVID-19 incident case and death data from USAFacts and the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering. We classified counties using the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a percentile-based measure from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in which higher scores represent more vulnerability. Using a Bayesian hierarchical negative binomial model, we estimated daily risk ratios (RRs) comparing counties in the first (lower) and fourth (upper) SVI quartiles. We adjusted for percentage of the county designated as rural, percentage in poor or fair health, percentage of adult smokers, county average daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5), percentage of primary care physicians per 100,000 residents, and the proportion tested for COVID-19 in the state. Results: In unadjusted analyses, we found that for most of March 2020, counties in the upper SVI quartile had significantly fewer cases per 100,000 than lower SVI quartile counties. However, on March 30, we observed a crossover effect in which the RR became significantly greater than 1.00 (RR = 1.10, 95% PI: 1.03, 1.18), indicating that the most vulnerable counties had, on average, higher COVID-19 incidence rates compared to least vulnerable counties. Upper SVI quartile counties had higher death rates on average starting on March 30 (RR = 1.17, 95% PI: 1.01,1.36). The death rate RR achieved a maximum value on July 29 (RR = 3.22, 95% PI: 2.91, 3.58), indicating that most vulnerable counties had, on average, 3.22 times more deaths per million than the least vulnerable counties. However, by late August, the lower quartile started to catch up to the upper quartile. In adjusted models, the RRs were attenuated for both incidence cases and deaths, indicating that the adjustment variables partially explained the associations. We also found positive associations between COVID-19 cases and deaths and percentage of the county designated as rural, percentage of resident in fair or poor health, and average daily PM2.5. Conclusions: Results indicate that the impact of COVID-19 is not static but can migrate from less vulnerable counties to more vulnerable counties over time. This highlights the importance of protecting vulnerable populations as the pandemic unfolds.",

    "abstract": "Aim: We aimed to estimate the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks in a case study COVID-free destination country, associated with shore leave for merchant ship crews. Methods: A stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1, designed specifically for COVID-19 was utilised. It was populated with parameters for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, shipping characteristics, and plausible control measures. Results: When no control interventions were in place, an outbreak of COVID-19 in our case study destination country (New Zealand; NZ) was estimated to occur after a median time of 23 days (assuming a global average for source country incidence of 2.66 new infections per 1000 population per week, a crew of 20, a voyage length of 10 days, 1 day of shore leave both in NZ and abroad, and 108 port visits by international merchant ships per week). For this example the uncertainty around when outbreaks occur is wide (an outbreak occurs with 95% probability between 1 and 124 days). The combined use of a PCR test on arrival, self-reporting of symptoms with contact tracing, and mask use during shore leave, increased this median time to 1.0 year (14 days to 5.4 years). Scenario analyses found that onboard infection chains could persist for well over 4 weeks even with crews of only 5 members. Conclusion: Introduction of SARS-CoV-2 through shore leave from international shipping crews is likely, even after long voyages. The risk can be substantially mitigated by control measures such as PCR testing and mask use.",

    "abstract": "Background Based on cases and deaths, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in England peaked in late March and early April 2020 and then declined until the end of June. Since the start of July, cases have increased, while deaths have continued to decrease. Methods We report results from 594,000 swabs tested for SARS-CoV-2 virus obtained from a representative sample of people in England over four rounds collected regardless of symptoms, starting in May 2020 and finishing at the beginning of September 2020. Swabs for the most recent two rounds were taken between 24th July and 11th August and for round 4 between 22nd August and 7th September. We estimate weighted overall prevalence, doubling times between and within rounds and associated reproduction numbers. We obtained unweighted prevalence estimates by sub-groups: age, sex, region, ethnicity, key worker status, household size, for which we also estimated odds of infection. We identified clusters of swab-positive participants who were closer, on average, to other swab-positive participants than would be expected. Findings Over all four rounds of the study, we found that 72% (67%, 76%) of swab-positive individuals were asymptomatic at the time of swab and in the week prior. The epidemic declined between rounds 1 and 2, and rounds 2 and 3. However, the epidemic was increasing between rounds 3 and 4, with a doubling time of 17 (13, 23) days corresponding to an R value of 1.3 (1.2, 1.4). When analysing round 3 alone, we found that the epidemic had started to grow again with 93% probability. Using only the most recent round 4 data, we estimated a doubling time of 7.7 (5.5, 12.7) days, corresponding to an R value of 1.7 (1.4, 2.0). Cycle threshold values were lower (viral loads were higher) for rounds 1 and 4 than they were for rounds 2 and 3. In round 4, we observed the highest prevalence in participants aged 18 to 24 years at 0.25% (0.16%, 0.41%), increasing from 0.08% (0.04%, 0.18%) in round 3. We observed the lowest prevalence in those aged 65 and older at 0.04% (0.02%, 0.06%) which was stable compared with round 3. Participants of Asian ethnicity had elevated odds of infection. We identified clusters in and around London, transient clusters in the Midlands, and an expanding area of clustering in the North West and more recently in Yorkshire and the Humber. Interpretation Although low levels of transmission persisted in England through to mid-summer 2020, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is now increasing. We found evidence of accelerating transmission at the end of August and beginning of September. Representative community antigen sampling can increase situational awareness and help improve public health decision making even at low prevalence.",

    "abstract": "Background. Hydroxychloroquine has been shown to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, but early clinical studies found no benefit treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We set out to evaluate the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for prevention, as opposed to treatment, of COVID-19 mortality. Methods. We pre-specified and conducted an observational, population-based cohort study using national primary care data and linked death registrations in the OpenSAFELY platform, representing 40% of the general population in England. We used Cox regression to estimate the association between ongoing routine hydroxychloroquine use prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in England and risk of COVID-19 mortality among people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Model adjustment was informed by a directed acyclic graph. Findings. Of 194,637 patients with RA or SLE, 30,569 (15.7%) received [&ge;]2 prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine in the six months prior to 1 March 2020. Between 1 March 2020 and 13 July 2020, there were 547 COVID-19 deaths, 70 among hydroxychloroquine users. Estimated standardised cumulative COVID-19 mortality was 0.23% (95% CI 0.18-0.29) among users and 0.22% (95% CI 0.20-0.25) among non-users; an absolute difference of 0.008% (95% CI -0.051-0.066). After accounting for age, sex, ethnicity, use of other immunuosuppressives, and geographic region, no association with COVID-19 mortality was observed (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.80-1.33). We found no evidence of interactions with age or other immunosuppressives. Quantitative bias analyses indicated observed associations were robust to missing information regarding additional biologic treatments for rheumatological disease. We observed similar associations with the negative control outcome of non-COVID-19 mortality. Interpretation. We found no evidence of a difference in COVID-19 mortality among patients who received hydroxychloroquine for treatment of rheumatological disease prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in England.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a new RNA virus affecting humans and spreads extensively through world populations since its first outbreak in late December, 2019. Whether the transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 is actively evolving, and driven by adaptation to the new host and environments is still unknown. Understanding the evolutionary mechanism underlying epidemiological and pathological characteristics of COVID-19 is essential for predicting the epidemic trend, and providing guidance for disease control and treatments. Interrogating 22,078 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences of 84 countries, we demonstrate with convincing evidence that (i) SARS-CoV-2 genomes are overall conserved under purifying selection. (ii) Ongoing positive selection is actively driving the evolution of specific genes. Notably, genes related to coronavirus infection and host immune system defense are under adaptive evolution while genes related to viral RNA replication, transcription and translation are under purifying selection. A spatial and temporal landscape of 54 critical mutants is constructed based on their divergence among viral haplotype clusters, of which multiple mutants potentially conferring viral transmissibility, infectivity and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 are highlighted.",

    "abstract": "Controlling the regional re-emergence of SARS-CoV-2 after its initial spread in ever-changing personal contact networks and disease landscapes is a challenging task. In a landscape context, contact opportunities within and between populations are changing rapidly as lockdown measures are relaxed and a number of social activities re-activated. Using an individual-based metapopulation model, we explored the efficacy of different control strategies across an urban-rural gradient in Wales, UK. Our model shows that isolation of symptomatic cases, or regional lockdowns in response to local outbreaks, have limited efficacy unless the overall transmission rate is kept persistently low. Additional isolation of non-symptomatic infected individuals, who may be detected by effective test and trace strategies, is pivotal to reduce the overall epidemic size over a wider range of transmission scenarios. We define an urban-rural gradient in epidemic size as a correlation between regional epidemic size and connectivity within the region, with more highly connected urban populations experiencing relatively larger outbreaks. For interventions focused on regional lockdowns, the strength of such gradients in epidemic size increased with higher travel frequencies, indicating a reduced efficacy of the control measure in the urban regions under these conditions. When both non-symptomatic and symptomatic individuals are isolated or regional lockdown strategies are enforced, we further found the strongest urban-rural epidemic gradients at high transmission rates. This effect was reversed for strategies targeted at symptomatics only. Our results emphasise the importance of test-and-tracing strategies and maintaining low transmission rates for efficiently controlling COVID19 spread, both at landscape scale and in urban areas.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss three different response strategies to a disease outbreak and their economic implications in an age-structured population. We have utilized the classical age structured SIR-model, thus assuming that recovered people will not be infected again. Available resource dynamics is governed by the well-known logistic growth model, in which the reproduction coefficient depends on the disease outbreak spreading dynamics. We further investigate the feedback interaction of the disease spread dynamics and resource growth dynamics with the premise that the quality of treatment depends on the current economic situation. The very inclusion of mortality rates and economic considerations in the same model may be incongruous under certain positions, but in this model, we take a 'realpolitik' approach by exploring all of these factors together as it is done in reality.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: This study investigated the performance and robustness of radiomics in predicting COVID-19 severity in a large public cohort. Methods: A public dataset of 1110 COVID-19 patients (1 CT/patient) was used. Using CTs and clinical data, each patient was classified into mild, moderate, and severe by two observers: (1) dataset provider and (2) a board-certified radiologist. For each CT, 107 radiomic features were extracted. The dataset was randomly divided into a training (60%) and holdout validation (40%) set. During training, features were selected and combined into a logistic regression model for predicting severe cases from mild and moderate cases. The models were trained and validated on the classifications by both observers. AUC quantified the predictive power of models. To determine model robustness, the trained models was cross-validated on the inter-observer classifications. Results: A single feature alone was sufficient to predict mild from severe COVID-19 with AUC_valid^provider=0.85 and AUC_valid^radiologist=0.74 (p<<0.01). The most predictive features were the distribution of small size-zones (GLSZM-SmallAreaEmphasis) for provider classification and linear dependency of neighboring voxels (GLCM-Correlation) for radiologist classification. Cross-validation showed that both AUC_valid^ {approx}0.80 (p<<0.01). In predicting moderate from severe COVID-19, first-order-Median alone had sufficient predictive power of AUC_valid^provider=0.65 (p=0.01). For radiologist classification, the predictive power of the model increased to AUC_valid^radiologist=0.66 (p<<0.01) as the number of features grew from 1 to 5. Cross-validation yielded AUC_valid^radiologist=0.63 (p=0.002) and AUC_valid^provider=0.60 (p=0.09). Conclusions: Radiomics significantly predicted different levels of COVID-19 severity. The prediction was moderately sensitive to inter-observer classifications, and thus need to be used with caution.",

    "abstract": "Background: Bhutan lacks a medical school and all their medical students are trained outside in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and India. When the COVID-19 pandemic let to closure of medical schools in these countries, the Bhutanese medical students were repatriated in March-April 2020. Upon return, they were kept in government-sponsored facility quarantine for 21 days. This study assessed their knowledge on COVID-19 as a part of self-learning and attitude as part of preparedness towards participation in government's health response to COVID-19. Method: This was a cross-sectional study among medical students who had returned to the country. This survey was conducted through an online questionnaire while the students were in 21-day facility quarantine. The sample size calculated was 129 and a convenient sampling was used. Knowledge was assessed using 20 questions, each scored 1/20. Cumulative score of score of >=80% was categorized as \"good knowledge\", score of >=60-79% was considered \"satisfactory knowledge\", and score <60% was considered \"poor knowledge.\" Correlation between knowledge score and duration of clinical clerkship was tested using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Attitude of students towards their willingness to participate in the national COVID-19 response were tested using rating scales. Data were analysed using Stata 13.1. Results: 120 medical students responded to this survey (response rate = 93%). Eighty-eight (74%) had good knowledge, 28 (23%) had satisfactory knowledge and only four (3%) had poor knowledge on COVID-19. The students scored high on the symptomatology, mode of transmission, prevention and treatment options and on local epidemiology; and scored low on the forms of mechanical ventilations and on the home-management of non-critical cases. The knowledge score correlated with duration of clinical clerkship (r = 0.326, p = 0.001). The primary source of information were social media sites (102, 85%), television (94, 78%) and newspapers (76, 63%). The majority (78, 65%) were willing to participate in the government's COVID-19 response but could not identify what roles they could play. The fear of contracting COVID-19 was reported in only in 8.7%. Conclusions: The medical students had good knowledge on COVID-19 and were self-learned through social media, television and newspapers. The students held positive attitude towards participation in the government's COVID-19 response.",

    "abstract": "This work characterizes the NIH contribution to vaccine technologies being employed in \"warp speed\" development of vaccines for COVID-19, as well as the lack of sustained NIH funding for published research against recognized epidemic threats. Using quantitative methods, we examined the advance of published research on ten of the vaccine technologies incorporated in the 165 candidate vaccines entering development through July 2020 as well as the NIH funding that supported this research. Live, attenuated virus, inactivated virus, and adjuvant technologies have been used in successful products since the 1950s and continue to exhibit steady advance. Synthetic (recombinant) vaccines, viral vectors, DNA, and TLR9 agonists as adjuvants emerged since the 1980s, and exhibit a logistic, \"S-curve\" pattern of growth characteristic of emerging technologies that have passed an analytically-defined established point. In contrast, mRNA, virus-like particle, and nanoparticle technologies show exponential growth characteristic of technologies short of their established points. The body of research and NIH funding for established and emerging vaccine technologies exhibited sustained growth through the late 2010s, supported by >16,000 thousand project years of NIH funding totaling over $17.2 billion (2000-2019), the majority through cooperative agreements and intramural programs. NIH funding for published research on vaccines for recognized zoonotic threats including coronavirus, Zika, Ebola, and dengue, however, has been inconsistent and reactive to disease outbreaks. These data are considered in the context of the high failure rate for candidate vaccines and evidence that technological maturity is a significant factor in the efficiency of product development. Sustained funding for both enabling technologies and vaccine development is essential to ensure a rapid response to COVID and future pandemic threats.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Serologic techniques can serve as a complement to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection. The objective of our study was to compare the diagnostic performance of six immunoassays to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2: three lateral flow immunoassays (LFAs), one ELISA and two chemiluminescence assays (CLIAs). Methods: We evaluated three LFAs (Alltest, One Step and SeroFlash), one ELISA (Dia.Pro) and two CLIAs (Elecsys and COV2T). To assess the specificity, 60 pre-pandemic sera were used. To evaluate the sensitivity, we used 80 serum samples from patients with positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Agreement between techniques was evaluated using the kappa score (k). Results: All immunoassays showed a specificity of 100% except for SeroFlash (96.7%). Overall sensitivity was 61.3%, 73.8%, 67.5%, 85.9%, 88.0% and 92.0% for Alltest, One Step, SeroFlash, Dia.Pro, Elecsys and COV2T, respectively. Sensitivity increased throughout the first two weeks from the onset of symptoms, reaching sensitivities over 85% from 14 days for all LFAs, being One Step the most sensitive (97.6%), followed by SeroFlash (95.1%). Dia.Pro, Elecsys and COV2T showed sensitivities over 97% from 14 days, being 100% for COV2T. One Step showed the best agreement results among LFAs, showing excellent agreement with Dia.Pro (agreement=94.2%, k=0.884), COV2T (99.1%, k=0.981) and Elecsys (97.3%, k=0.943). Dia.Pro, COV2T and Elecsys also showed excellent agreement between them. Conclusions: One Step, Dia.Pro, Elecsys and COV2T obtained the best diagnostic performance results. All these techniques showed a specificity of 100% and sensitivities over 97% from 14 days after the onset of symptoms, as well as excellent levels of agreement.",

    "abstract": "Introduction A controversy remains worldwide regarding the transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital settings. We reviewed the current evidence on the air contamination with SARS-CoV-2 in hospital settings, and the factors associated to the contamination including the viral load and the particles size. Methods The MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science databases were systematically interrogated for original English-language articles detailing COVID-19 air contamination in hospital settings between 1 December 2019 and 21 July 2020. This study was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. The positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and culture were described and compared according to the setting, clinical context, air ventilation system, and distance from patient. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in copies per m3 of air were pooled and their distribution were described by hospital areas. Particle sizes and SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in copies or TCID50 per m3 were analysed after categorization of sizes in <1 micrometers, 1-4 micrometers, and >4 micrometers. Results Among 2,034 records identified, 17 articles were included in the review. Overall, 27.5% (68/247) of air sampled from close patients environment were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, without difference according to the setting (ICU: 27/97, 27.8%; non-ICU: 41/150, 27.3%; p=0.93), the distance from patients (<1 meter: 1/64, 1.5%; 1-5 meters: 4/67, 6%; p=0.4). In other areas, the positivity rate was 23.8% (5/21) in toilets, 9.5% (20/221) in clinical areas, 12.4% (15/121) in staff areas, and 34.1% (14/41) in public areas. A total of 78 viral cultures were performed in three studies, and 3 (4%) were positive, all from close patients environment. The median SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations varied from 1.103 copies per m3 (IQR: 0.4.103-9.103) in clinical areas to 9.7.103 (5.1.103-14.3.103) in the air of toilets or bathrooms. The protective equipment removal and patients rooms had high concentrations/titre of SARS-CoV-2 with aerosol size distributions that showed peaks in the <1 micrometers region, and staff offices in the >4 micrometers region. Conclusion In hospital, the air near and away from COVID-19 patients is frequently contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with however, rare proofs of their viability. High viral loads found in toilet/bathrooms, staff and public hallways suggests to carefully consider these areas.",

    "abstract": "Background: Gargling had been reported to have significant roles in the prevention and treatment of respiratory tract infections. The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of regular gargling to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 in the oropharynx and nasopharynx. Methodology: This pilot, open labeled, randomized, parallel study compared the effect of 30 seconds, 3 times/day gargling using 1% povidone-iodine (PVP-I), essential oils and tap water on SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance among COVID-19 patients in a tertiary hospital in Kuala Lumpur. Progress was monitored by day 4,6 and 12 PCR (Ct value), gargling and symptoms diary as well as clinical observations. Results: Five confirmed Stage 1 COVID-19 patients were recruited for each arm. The age range was from 22 to 56 years old. The majority were males. Two respondents had co-morbidities, which were asthma and obesity. Viral clearance was achieved at day 6 in 100%, 80%, 20% and 0% for 1% PVP-I, essential oils, tap water and control group respectively. Analysis of 1% PVP-I group versus control group showed significant p-value for comparison of PCR results on Day 4, Day 6 and Day 12. Conclusions: This preliminary study showed that gargling with 1% PVP-I and essential oils show great potential to be part of the treatment and management of Stage 1 COVID-19. Larger studies are required to ascertain the benefit of gargling for different stages of COVID-19 patients. This study was registered in clinicaltrial.gov (NCT04410159).",

    "abstract": "Background How aberrant fibrinolysis influences the clinical progression of COVID-19 presents a clinicopathological dilemma challenging intensivists. To investigate whether abnormal fibrinolysis is a culprit or protector or both, we associated elevated plasma D-dimer with clinical variables to identify a panoramic view of the derangements of fibrinolysis that contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 based on studies available in the literature. Methods We performed this systematic review based on both meta-analysis and meta-regression to compute the correlation of D-dimer at admission with clinical features of COVID-19 patients in retrospective studies or case series. We searched the databases until Aug 18, 2020, with no limitations by language. The first hits were screened, data extracted, and analyzed in duplicate. We did the random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions (both univariate and multivariate). D-dimer associated clinical variables and potential mechanisms were schematically reasoned and graphed. Findings Our search identified 42 observational, or retrospective, or case series from six countries (n=14,862 patients) with all races and ages from 1 to 98-year-old. The weighted mean difference of D-dimer was 0.97 g/mL (95% CI 0.65, 1.29) between relatively mild (or healthy control) and severely affected groups with significant publication bias. Univariate meta-regression identified 58 of 106 clinical variables were associated with plasma D-dimer levels, including 3 demographics, 5 comorbidies, 22 laboratory tests, 18 organ injury biomarkers, 8 severe complications, and 2 outcomes (discharge and death). Of these, 11 readouts were negatively associated with the level of plasma D-dimer. Further, age and gender were confounding factors for the identified D-dimer associated variables. There were 22 variables independently correlated with the D-dimer level, including respiratory rate, dyspnea plasma K+, glucose, SpO2, BUN, bilirubin, ALT, AST, systolic blood pressure, and CK. We thus propose that \"insufficient hyperfibrinolysis (fibrinolysis is accelerated but unable to prevent adverse clinical impact for clinical deterioration COVID-19)\" as a peculiar mechanism. Interpretation The findings of this meta-analysis- and meta-regression-based systematic review supports elevated D-dimer as an independent predictor for mortality and severe complications. D-dimer-associated clinical variables draw a landscape integrating the aggregate effects of systemically suppressive and locally (i.e., in the lung) hyperactive derangements of fibrinolysis. D-dimer and associated clinical biomarkers and conceptually parameters could be combined for risk stratification, potentially for tracking thrombolytic therapy or alternative interventions.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to analyze factors impacting the Covid-19 epidemic on a macro level, comparing multiple countries across the world and verifying the occurrence at a micro level through cluster analysis. The severity of the epidemic was most strongly related to exposure to ultraviolet light and extrapolated levels of vitamin D and to the health of the population, especially with regards to obesity. We found no county with an obesity level < 8% with a severe epidemic. We also found that countries where the population benefited from sun exposure or vitamin D supplementation and spent time outside fared well. Factors related to increased propagation of the virus included the use of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), population density, poorly aerated gatherings, relative humidity, timely policies of closing clustering places until aeration was improved, and daily amount of ridership on public transportation, especially subways. Population lockdowns, masks, and blood type did not provide much explanatory power. Contact tracing was not analyzed as very few countries applied it for long enough. The excess mortality observed is within the ranges of severe past influenza epidemics of 2016/2017 or 1999/2000 and lower than older severe influenza epidemics of the 1940s or 1970s. We estimated that COVID mortality death counts in European countries is over estimated when taking into account excess mortality further confirming the important role of comorbidities independently of lockdown policy. A few countries observed an under-mortality despite of some deaths counts attributed to COVID-19. Treatments or vaccines should protect the fraction of the population that is not suffering from severe comorbidities. Our study suggested that prevention measures should be directed to improving aeration systems, enhancing diets and exercise, and ensuring adequate levels of vitamin D. Prevention measures and attention should be paid to anxiety resulting from this episode which may be associated with increases in obesity, addictions, vitamin D deficiency, depression, suicide, and hunger ultimately weakening population resiliency.",

    "abstract": "Background: Healthcare workers (HCW) treating COVID-19 patients are at high risk for infection and may also spread infection through their contact with vulnerable patients. Smell loss has been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it is unknown whether monitoring for smell loss can be used to identify asymptomatic infection among high risk individuals, like HCW. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study, tracking 473 HCW across three months to determine if smell loss could predict SARS-CoV-2 infection in this high-risk group. HCW subjects completed a longitudinal, novel behavioral at-home assessment of smell function with household items, as well as detailed symptom surveys that included a parosmia screening questionnaire, and RT-qPCR testing to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 17 (3.6%) of 473 HCW. Among the 17 infected HCW, 53% reported smell loss, and were more likely to report smell loss than COVID-negative HCW on both the at-home assessment and the screening questionnaire (P < .01). 67% reported smell loss prior to having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and smell loss was reported a median of two days before testing positive. Neurological symptoms were reported more frequently among COVID-positive HCW who reported smell loss (P < .01). Conclusions: In this prospective study of HCW, self-reported changes in smell using two different measures were predictive of COVID-19 infection. Smell loss frequently preceded a positive test and was associated with neurological symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Background. In the months following the global spread of SARS-CoV-2, the lack of effective pharmaceutical interventions led to widespread implementation of behavioral interventions aimed at reducing contacts and transmission. In the US, state and local governments introduced and enforced the bulk of interventions, including university closures. As universities closed, student departures decreased the total population size of college towns while state-level interventions decreased contacts among remaining residents. Though the pandemic continues without pharmaceutical interventions, businesses have begun to reopen, and many universities have resumed operations. These actions have increased contacts and population sizes in college towns. Monitoring movement to implement adaptive policies will be critical for outbreak management. Methods. We use publicly available remotely-sensed nighttime lights and traffic cameras to measure the impact of restriction policies on movement and activities in the university town of State College, and the surrounding areas of Centre County, Pennsylvania, USA. Results. At the county level, nighttime radiance did not differ significantly across restriction phases and largely reflected seasonal fluctuations seen in previous years. Throughout the county, traffic volumes were lowest during the most severe period of restrictions ('Red phase' in Pennsylvania). As restrictions eased, traffic volumes grew, indicating increased movement within and between population centers. We show that real-time, publicly available traffic data captured behavioral responses and compliance to different restrictions phases. We also demonstrate that these increases in activity levels precede increases in reported COVID-19 cases. Conclusion. Passively collected data can measure population-level movement in response to restrictions and changes in these measured movements are reflected in observed SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Measuring these changes in movements and contacts in near real time can inform local adaptive interventions to curtail outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "As in past pandemics, co-circulating pathogens may play a role in the epidemiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here we hypothesized that influenza interacted with SARS-CoV-2 during the early 2020 epidemic of COVID-19 in Europe. We developed a population-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, combined with mortality incidence data in four European countries, to test a range of assumptions about the impact of influenza. We found consistent evidence for a 2-2.5-fold population-level increase in SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with influenza during the period of co-circulation. These results suggest the need to increase vaccination against influenza, not only to reduce the burden due to influenza viruses, but also to counteract their facilitatory impact on SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Remaining a major healthcare concern with nearly 27 million confirmed cases worldwide at the time of writing, novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 880 thousand deaths since its outbreak in China, December 2019. First case of a person testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection within the territory of the Republic of Latvia was registered on 2nd of March 2020, nine days prior to the pandemic declaration by WHO. Since then, more than 230 000 tests were carried out confirming a total of 1330 cases of COVID-19 in the country as of 20th of August 2020. Rapidly reacting to the spread of the infection, an ongoing sequencing campaign was started mid-March in collaboration with the local testing laboratories, with an ultimate goal in sequencing as much local viral isolates as possible, resulting in first full-length SARS-CoV-2 isolate genome sequences from the Baltics region being made publicly available in early April. With 109 viral isolates representing ~8.2% of the total COVID-19 cases in the country being completely sequenced as of today, here we provide a first report on the genetic diversity of Latvian SARS-CoV-2 isolates.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: The aim of this study was to estimate the seroprevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in health workers of the Sanitary Region VIII, at province of Buenos Aires during June 2020. Methods: a cross-sectional design was used. A probabilistic sampling by two-stage conglomerates was carried out. Data were collected from a self-administered questionnaire and a blood sample for antibody identification. The COVIDAR IgG and IgM test were used. RESULTS: 738 health workers were included; the overall response rate was 73.80%. 71.83% of that were women; age showed a normal distribution. Nurses and doctors accounted for more than half of the staff. 75.86% of people claimed to always use Personal Protective Equipment. 5.61% of people had close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19. 4.60% of people had previously had a nasopharyngeal swab with a negative result. Five workers had positive IgG for SARS-CoV-2 (four women and one man) with negative IgM. The mean age of the cases was 35 years old; two of them were asymptomatic; neither of them had a swab sample taken. The overall seroprevalence was 0.75%, with no significant differences between strata. Discussion: the seroprevalence found was low; indicating a large proportion of workers was susceptible to infection. We stress the need to complement passive epidemiological surveillance strategies with serological monitoring in health workers.",

    "abstract": "Objective The impact of COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) conditions is not clearly understood. To explore risk factors associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and survival in this patient group, we conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort study. Design We interrogated linked electronic health records for patients diagnosed with HPB diseases in East London since 2008 (n=15 586), and identified 212 confirmed COVID-19 cases between February 12 and June 12, 2020. We conducted risk analyses to identify the effect of demographics, comorbidities and associated medication use, and lifestyle factors and with appropriate adjustment for gender, ethnicity, age group and HPB diagnoses on COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Results We observed an increased risk of COVID-19 for men (Relative Risk, RR=1.59; 95% CI 1.21 to 2.09) and Black ethnicity (RR=2.2; 95% CI 1.5 to 3.18). Substance mis-users were at more risk of infection, so were patients on Vitamin D treatment. The higher risks associated with South Asian ethnicity, patients with pre-existing non-malignant pancreatic or liver conditions, age>70, and past smokers were due to co-existing comorbidities; surprisingly current smokers were associated with a lower risk. Increased mortality risk was observed for Black ethnicity (RR=2.4; 95% CI 1.35 to 3.48), and patients with a pre-existing kidney condition (RR=2.13; 95% CI 1.16 to 3.55) - particularly when accompanied with an acute episode of renal complications (RR=2.74; 95% CI 1.32 to 5.13). Conclusions This large multi-ethnic population-based study of HPB patients shows a higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 for male gender, Black ethnicity, medical co-morbidities, and substance mis-users. Particular attention should be paid to patients with a pre-existing kidney disease for further renal insult to prevent fatality.",

    "abstract": "Objective: There has been significant disruption to the lives and mental health of adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the exact nature of the effects is not known. The purpose of this study was to assess the psychological and lifestyle impact of the pandemic on Australian adolescents, using an online survey, administered during and after the peak of the outbreak (June-July 2020). Method: Self-report surveys were administered online to a sample of 760 Australian adolescents aged 12-18 years old. Surveys assessed worry about contracting COVID-19, behavioral change in response to the pandemic, impact on education, peer and family relationships, lifestyle factors including exercise, technology use and sleep, as well as mental health outcomes including psychological distress, loneliness, health anxiety and wellbeing. Results: Overall, young people expressed significant concern and worry about contracting the virus, and most (>85%) engaged in behaviors to reduce the risk of transmission. Three quarters of the sample reported a worsening of their mental health since the pandemic began, with negative impacts reported by most respondents on learning, friendships and family relationships. More than 40% of young people reported a decrease in exercise and 70% reported an increase in technology use since the outbreak. There were high levels of uncertainty about the future reported by respondents, and their scores on validated measures indicated higher levels of sleep disturbance, psychological distress and health anxiety, and lower levels of wellbeing, relative to normative samples. Reponses on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale indicated that 48.3% of the sample were experiencing distress consistent with a probable mental illness, which is much higher than pre-pandemic prevalence rates. Effects on mental health were worse among those who reported a previous diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety relative to those without a history of depression and/or anxiety. Conclusion: These results indicate high levels of disruption and psychological distress experienced by adolescents during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescents are already vulnerable to the onset of mental illness at this developmental stage, and the current research underscores the need to find rapid and accessible ways to support adolescent mental health during times of crisis. There is a need for longitudinal research to evaluate the enduring effects of the pandemic on adolescents.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: The coronavirus pandemic's public health and economic impacts have led to much hope in the US regarding the prospect of a safe, effective vaccine to either prevent infection or minimize symptoms and reduce mortality risk. However, recent US polls indicate a concerning level of hesitancy that will likely lead to suboptimal uptake if such a vaccine becomes available. This study investigated demographic differences regarding US adults' intent, uncertainty, and refusal to receive a potential coronavirus vaccine and specific reasons for intention to receive it. Methods and findings: Multivariable analysis of Associated Press (AP)-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research cross-sectional survey data collected in May 2020 from a US nationally representative panel of adults (n=1000). Respondents were asked if they would receive a coronavirus vaccine (yes, unsure, no). Among those answering yes, the specific reasons were: to protect self, family, and community; chronic health condition; and having a doctor who recommends vaccines. Multinomial logistic regression models indicated numerous subgroup differences between participants who indicating (1) uncertainty versus refusal, (2) intent versus refusal, and (3) intent versus uncertainty, with the highest number of significant differences observed in the third comparison. Overall, higher likelihood of intention to receive the vaccine versus uncertainty and refusal were mostly observed among respondents with a college education or greater, White, non-Hispanic racial-ethnic identity, ages 60 or older, and more liberal (versus conservative) ideology. Despite variation in endorsement across the five reasons for wanting to receive the vaccine, subgroup differences were fairly consistent across these specific reasons when comparing respondents endorsing such intentions versus, respectively, refusal and uncertainty in separate analyses. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the approval of a vaccine will potentially face problems with overall uptake due to uncertainty or refusal and contribute to creating significant demographic disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality risk. Ongoing assessment of such attitudes are needed as Phase III trials proceed, but the findings highlight need for measuring uncertainty and its underlying reasons, as well as multiple types of education and outreach efforts for those who are uncertain as well as avoidant.",

    "abstract": "New York City experienced a large COVID-19 pandemic wave during March - May 2020. We model the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in the city during the pandemic and estimate the effectiveness of public health interventions (overall and for each major intervention separately) for the entire population and by age group. We estimate that the overall effective reproductive number was 2.99 at the beginning of the pandemic wave and reduced to 0.93 one week after the stay-at-home mandate. Most age groups experienced similar reductions in transmission. Interventions reducing contact rates were associated with a 70.7% (95% CI: 65.0 - 76.4%) reduction of transmission overall and >50% for all age groups during the pandemic. Face covering was associated with a 6.6% (95% CI: 0.8 - 12.4%) reduction of transmission overall and up to 20% for 65+ year-olds during the first month of implementation. Accounting for the amount of time masks are in use (i.e. mainly outside homes), these findings indicate universal masking could reduce transmission by up to 28-32% when lockdown-like measures are lifted, if the high effectiveness estimated for older adults were achieved for all ages. These estimates are verified by out-of-fit projections and support the need for implementing multiple interventions simultaneously in order to effectively mitigate the spread of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "International travel poses substantial risks for continued introduction of SARS-CoV-2. As of the 17th August 2020, travellers from 12 of the top 25 countries flying into the UK are required to self-isolate for 14 days. We estimate that 895 (CI: 834-958) infectious travellers arrive in a single week, of which 87% (779, CI: 722-837) originate from countries on the UK quarantine list. We compare alternative measures to the 14 day self-isolation (78.0% effective CI: 74.4-81.6) which could be more feasible long-term. A single RT-PCR taken upon arrival at the airport is 39.6% (CI: 35.2-43.7) effective, or equivalently, it would only detect 2 in 5 infectious passengers. Alternatively, testing four days after arrival is 64.3% (CI: 60.0-68.3) effective whereas a test at the airport plus additional test four days later is 68.9% (CI: 64.9-73.0) effective. Rapidly implementing control measures for travellers from risky countries is vital to protect public health; this methodology can be quickly updated to assess the impact of any further changes to international travel policy or disease occurrence.",

    "abstract": "Background: To halt the spread of COVID-19, Austria implemented a 7-week shut-down of public life in March/April 2020 which was followed by a gradual withdrawal of these restriction measures in May/June 2020. We expect that the ensuing reduction in social contacts led to increased loneliness among older adults (60+). Methods: We conducted three analyses to assess the association between COVID-19 public health restriction measures and loneliness: (1) A comparison between pre-pandemic (SHARE: 2013-2017) and pandemic (May 2020) levels of loneliness (UCLA-3 scale), (2) an analysis of the correlation between being affected by COVID-19 restriction measures and loneliness based on cross-sectional survey data from early May 2020, and (3) a longitudinal analysis of weekly changes in loneliness (Corona panel data) from late March to early June 2020. Results: We found (1) loneliness levels to have increased in 2020 in comparison with previous years, (2) an association between the number of restriction measures older adults reported to be affected from and loneliness, and (3) that loneliness was higher during shut-down compared to the subsequent re-opening phase, particularly among those who live alone. Discussion: Our results provide evidence that COVID-19 restriction measures in Austria have indeed resulted in increased levels of loneliness among older adults. However, these effects seem to be short-lived, and thus we do not expect strong negative consequences for older adults mental health downstream. Nonetheless, effects of longer and/or repeated future restriction measures aiming at social distancing should be closely monitored.",

    "abstract": "The response of the scientific community to the global health emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has produced an unprecedented number of manuscripts in a short period of time, the vast majority of which has been shared in the form of preprints posted before peer review on preprint repositories. This surge in preprint publications has in itself attracted considerable attention, although mostly in the bibliometric literature. In the present study we apply a mathematical growth model, known as the generalized Richards model, to describe the time evolution of the cumulative number of COVID-19 related preprints. This mathematical approach allows us to infer several important aspects concerning the underlying growth dynamics, such as its current stage and its possible evolution in the near future. We also analyze the rank-frequency distribution of preprints servers, ordered by the number of COVID-19 preprints they host, and find that it follows a power-law decay. This Zipf-like law indicates the presence of a cumulative advantage effect, whereby servers that already have more preprints receive more submissions.",

    "abstract": "During the last months, the pandemic generated by coro- navirus SARS-CoV-2 moved governments, research groups and health organizations to plan, test and execute health policies. At the beginning, the treatment was not clear but in the next months, research groups have conducted studies to recommend or ban some medicines. At the same time, countries with most cases were changing from Asia, Europe to America. Different treatments and medications have been tested and recommended in many countries, such as Hydroxycloroquine ,Ivermectin, Azithromycin, Dexametha- sone, Prednisone, Remdesivir . This paper is a preliminary study about which medications people are searching on the Internet, considering ten countries with most cases in the world such as Chile, Spain, United Kingdom, Brazil, United States, India, Russia, South Africa, Peru and Mexico.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: The World Health Organisation (WHO) and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend various triage tools to assist decision-making for patients with suspected COVID-19. We aimed to estimate the accuracy of triage tools for predicting severe illness in adults presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected COVID-19 infection. Methods: We undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 70 EDs across the United Kingdom (UK). We collected data from people attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020, and used presenting data to determine the results of assessment with the following triage tools: the WHO algorithm, NEWS2, CURB-65, CRB-65, PMEWS and the swine flu adult hospital pathway (SFAHP). We used 30-day outcome data (death or receipt of respiratory, cardiovascular or renal support) to determine prognostic accuracy for adverse outcome. Results: We analysed data from 20892 adults, of whom 4672 (22.4%) died or received organ support (primary outcome), with 2058 (9.9%) receiving organ support and 2614 (12.5%) dying without organ support (secondary outcomes). C-statistics for the primary outcome were: CURB-65 0.75; CRB-65 0.70; PMEWS 0.77; NEWS2 (score) 0.77; NEWS2 (rule) 0.69; SFAHP (6-point) 0.70; SFAHP (7-point) 0.68; WHO algorithm 0.61. All triage tools showed worse prediction for receipt of organ support and better prediction for death without organ support. At the recommended threshold, PMEWS and the WHO criteria showed good sensitivity (0.96 and 0.95 respectively), at the expense of specificity (0.31 and 0.27 respectively). NEWS2 showed similar sensitivity (0.96) and specificity (0.28) when a lower threshold than recommended was used. Conclusion: CURB-65, PMEWS and NEWS2 provide good but not excellent prediction for adverse outcome in suspected COVID-19, and predicted death without organ support better than receipt of organ support. PMEWS, the WHO criteria and NEWS2 (using a lower threshold than usually recommended) provide good sensitivity at the expense of specificity.",

We collected data from children attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020, and used presenting data to determine the results of assessment using the WHO algorithm, swine flu hospital pathway for children (SFHPC), Paediatric Observation Priority Score (POPS) and Childrens Observation and Severity Tool (COAST). We recorded 30-day outcome data (death or receipt of respiratory, cardiovascular or renal support) to determine prognostic accuracy for adverse outcome. Results: We collected data from 1530 children, including 26 (1.7%) with an adverse outcome. C-statistics were 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.73-0.87) for the WHO algorithm, 0.80 (0.71-0.90) for POPS, 0.76 (0.67-0.85) for COAST, and 0.71 (0.59-0.82) for SFHPC. Using pre-specified thresholds, the WHO algorithm had the highest sensitivity (0.85) and lowest specificity (0.75), but POPS and COAST could optimise sensitivity (0.96 and 0.92 respectively) at the expense of specificity (0.25 and 0.38 respectively) by using a threshold of any score above zero instead of the pre-specified threshold. Conclusion: Existing triage tools have good but not excellent prediction for adverse outcome in children with suspected COVID-19. POPS and COAST could achieve an appropriate balance of sensitivity and specificity for supporting decisions to discharge home by considering any score above zero to be positive.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 poses a major challenge to care homes, as SARS-CoV-2 is readily transmitted and causes disproportionately severe disease in older people. Here, we report on 6,600 COVID-19 cases from the East of England, 1,167 of which were identified as residents from 337 care homes. Older age and being a care home resident were associated with increased mortality. SARS-CoV-2 genomes were available for 700 residents from 292 care homes. By integrating genomic and temporal data we defined 409 viral clusters within the 292 homes, indicating two different patterns - outbreaks among care home residents and independent introductions with limited onward transmission. Approximately 70% of residents in the genomic analysis were admitted to hospital during the study period, providing extensive opportunities for transmission between care homes and hospitals. Limiting viral transmission between care home residents should be a key target for infection control to reduce COVID-19 mortality in this population.",

    "abstract": "Objective We aim to provide a snapshot of the levels of burnout, anxiety, depression and distress among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, setting, participants We distributed an online survey via social media in June 2020 that was open to any healthcare worker. The primary outcome measure was symptoms of burnout as measured using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI). Secondary outcomes of depression, anxiety and distress as measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, General Anxiety Scale-7, and Impact of Events Scale-Revised were recorded along with subjective measures of stress. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with burnout, depression, anxiety and distress. Results Of 539 persons responding to the survey, 90% were female, and 26% were aged 41-50 years, 53% were nurses. Participants with moderate-to-severe burnout were younger (49% [206/424] versus 33% [38/115] under 40 years, P=0.004), and more likely to have pre-existing comorbidities (21% versus 12%, P=0.031). They were twice as likely to have been redeployed from their usual role (22% versus 11%; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-3.3, P=0.042), or to work in an area dedicated to COVID-19 patients (50% versus 32%, adjusted OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.8, P<0.001), and were almost 4-times more likely to have previous depression (24% versus 7%; adjusted OR 3.6, 95% CI 2.2-5.9, P=0.012). A supportive workplace team and male sex protected against burnout reducing the odds by 40% (adjusted OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.7, P<0.001) and 70% (adjusted OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.5, P=0.003), respectively. Conclusion Independent predictors of burnout were younger staff, redeployment to a new working area, working with patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, and being female or having a previous history of depression. Evaluation of existing psychological support interventions is required with targeted approaches to ensure support is available to those most at risk.",

    "abstract": "Importance. As universities around the world decide whether to remain open or to close their campuses because of the COVID-19 pandemic, they often are doing so without objective information on the preferences and risk tolerance of their students. Objectives. To quantify: 1) risk tolerance for in-person instruction; 2) willingness to pay for in-person instruction versus online-only instruction; and 3) risk-tolerance for social activities held off campus among knowledgable students. Design, Setting, and Participants. We developed an automated survey tool that administered a standard gamble exercise grounded in game theory to 46 Columbia University public health graduate students who were knowledgeable about COVID-19 and who had experience with both online and offline coursework. Students were asked to trade between the risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 and: 1) attending classes in-person versus online and 2) attending parties in the greater New York City area. We also assessed their willingness to pay for online only tuition, and plans to travel off campus. Main Outcome Measures. The decision point in iterative trade-offs between risk of infection with COVID-19 and a desired goal (taking classes in-person or attending social events). Results. On average, students were willing to accept a 23% (standard error [SE]: 4%) risk of infection on campus over the semester in exchange for the opportunity to attend classes in-person. Students were willing-to-pay only 48% (SE: 3%) of typical in-person tuition were courses held exclusively online, and no students were willing to pay full price for online-only instruction. Students planned to leave campus an average of 3.6 times per week (SE: 0.54), and 15% of the students would be willing to attend a party in the community surrounding the university even if the prevalence of circulating COVID-19 were high. Conclusions and Relevance. Students with a strong knowledge of COVID-19 transmission and risks are an enigma: they are willing to pay only around 50% for online classes but likely to engage in activities that present significant barriers to holding in-person classes. This enigma underscores the conundrum facing universities.",

    "abstract": "Background and objectives: Several antibody tests are available to detect SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies, many of which address different antigens. Rapid point-of-care (POC) tests have been doubted due to an eventual risk of production errors, although it is unstudied whether such error would affect test sensitivity and/or specificity. We aimed to evaluate two separate production lots of a commercially available test intended for rapid detection of IgM and IgG against the N-terminal part of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1). Materials and methods: Serum samples from individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, by RT-PCR and/or serology, and pre-COVID-19 negative control sera gathered from a biobank during 2018 were collected. The presence of anti-S1 IgM/IgG was verified by an in-house Luminex-based serological assay, serving as reference method. The index test was a commercially available rapid POC-test (the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette [Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech Co Ltd, Huzhou, Zhejiang, China/Healgen Scientific, LLC, U.S.A.]). Results: One hundred samples were verified positive for anti-S1 IgG (median fluorescence intensity (MFI) greater than or equal to 900) and 74 for anti-S1 IgM (MFI greater than or equal to 700), confirmed by RT-PCR (n=90) and/or serology (n=89). None of the negative controls (n=200; MFI <300) had SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 IgM, while one tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 IgG. For the two lots, the sensitivities of the rapid test were 93.2% (69/74; 95% CI: 85.1% - 97.1%) and 87.8% (65/74; 95% CI: 78.5% - 93.5%) for IgM, respectively 93.0% (93/100; 95% CI: 86.3% - 96.6%) and 100.0% for IgG (100/100; 95% CI: 96.3% - 100.0%). The specificity for both lots was 100% for IgM (200/200; 95% CI: 98.1% - 100%) and 99.5% for IgG (199/200; 95% CI: 97.2% - 99.9%). The positive predictive value was 100% for IgM and 98.9% and 99.0% for IgG. The negative predictive value was 95.7% and 97.6% for IgM, and 96.6% and 100.0% for IgG. Conclusion: The rapid POC-test used in this study is suitable to assess SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 specific IgM/IgG, as a measure of previous virus exposure on an individual level. While the specificity was not affected by production lot, external validation of separate lots of rapid POC-tests is encouraged to ensure high sensitivity before market introduction.",

    "abstract": "Background: By mid-July 2020, more than 108,000 COVID-19 cases had been diagnosed in Canada with more than half in the province of Quebec. To be prepared for a potential second wave of COVID-19 in the fall, it seems of utmost importance to analyze the epidemiological and socio-economic characteristics of the spring outbreak in the population. Method: We conducted an online survey of the participants of the CARTaGENE population-based cohort, composed of middle-aged and older adults. We collected information on socio-demographic, lifestyle, health condition, COVID-related symptoms and COVID-19 testing. We studied the association between these factors and two outcomes: the status of having been tested for SARS-CoV-2 and the status of having received a positive test when having been tested. These associations were evaluated with univariate and multivariate analyzes using a hybrid tree-based regression model. Results: Among the 8,129 respondents from the CARTaGENE cohort, 649 were tested for COVID-19 and 41 were positive. Medical workers and individuals having a contact with a COVID-19 patient had the highest probabilities of being tested (32% and 42.4%, respectively) and of being positive (17.2% and 13.0%, respectively) among those tested. 7.6% of the participants declared that they have experienced at least one of the four COVID-related symptoms chosen by the Public Health authorities (fever, cough, dyspnea, anosmia) but were not tested. Results from the tree-based model analyzes adjusted on exposure factors show that the combination of dyspnea, dry cough and fever was highly associated with being tested whereas anosmia, fever, and headache were the most discriminant factors for having a positive test among those tested. During the spring outbreak, more than one third of the participants have experienced a decrease in access to health services. There were sex and age differences in the socio-economic and emotional impacts of the pandemic. Conclusion: We have shown some discrepancies between the symptoms associated with being tested and being positive. In particular, the anosmia is a major discriminant symptom for positivity whereas ear-nose-throat symptoms seem not to be COVID-related. The results also emphasize the need of increasing the accessibility of testing for the general population.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Very little is known about possible clinical sequelae that may persist after resolution of the acute Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). A recent longitudinal cohort from Italy including 143 patients recovered after hospitalisation with COVID-19 reported that 87% had at least one ongoing symptom at 60 day follow-up. Early indications suggest that patients with COVID-19 may need even more psychological support than typical ICU patients. The assessment of risk factors for longer term consequences requires a longitudinal study linked to data on pre-existing conditions and care received during the acute phase of illness. Methods and analysis This is an international open-access prospective, observational multi-site study. It will enrol patients following a diagnosis of COVID-19. Tier 1 is developed for following up patients day 28 post-discharge, additionally at 3 to 6 months intervals. This module can be used to identify sub-sets of patients experiencing specific symptomatology or syndromes for further follow up. A Tier 2 module will be developed for in-clinic, in-depth follow up. The primary aim is to characterise physical consequences in patients post-COVID-19. Secondary aim includes estimating the frequency of and risk factors for post-COVID- 19 medical sequalae, psychosocial consequences and post-COVID-19 mortality. A subset of patients will have sampling to characterize longer term antibody, innate and cell-mediated immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. Ethics and dissemination This collaborative, open-access study aims to characterize the frequency of and risk factors for long-term consequences and characterise the immune response over time in patients following a diagnosis of COVID-19 and facilitate standardized and longitudinal data collection globally. The outcomes of this study will inform strategies to prevent long term consequences; inform clinical management, direct rehabilitation, and inform public health management to reduce overall morbidity and improve outcomes of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Background This study aimed to describe the population at risk of severe COVID-19 due to underlying health conditions across the United Kingdom in 2019. Methods We used anonymised electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD to describe the point prevalence on 5 March 2019 of the at-risk population following national guidance. Prevalence for any risk condition and for each individual condition is given overall and stratified by age and region. We repeated the analysis on 5 March 2014 for full regional representation and to describe prevalence of underlying health conditions in pregnancy. We additionally described the population of cancer survivors, and assessed the value of linked secondary care records for ascertaining COVID-19 at-risk status. Findings On 5 March 2019, 24.4% of the UK population were at risk due to a record of at least one underlying health condition, including 8.3% of school-aged children, 19.6% of working-aged adults, and 66.2% of individuals aged 70 years or more. 7.1% of the population had multimorbidity. The size of the at-risk population was stable over time comparing 2014 to 2019, despite increases in chronic liver disease and diabetes and decreases in chronic kidney disease and current asthma. Separately, 1.6% of the population had a new diagnosis of cancer in the past five years. Interpretation The population at risk of severe COVID-19 (aged [&ge;]70 years, or with an underlying health condition) comprises 18.5 million individuals in the UK, including a considerable proportion of school-aged and working-aged individuals.",

    "abstract": "People may experience a heightened level of stress reactions during a pandemic event and in an isolated social environment. A multi-national survey about such mental health information about COVID-19 was conducted in May 2020 across six Asian regions: Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. Data were collected from a population representative sample of 11,895 adults on their stress symptoms and reactions to COVID-19 and the related public health measures. 59.1% of the respondents showed at least one substantial stress symptom. The situation was particularly worrying in South Korea, where 75% of the respondents reported substantial stress symptoms. Respondents who were young, educated, lived in an urban area, had a high socio-economic status, had a history of chronic illness or mental illness, or who lived with a pregnant woman, elderly or children were most vulnerable to stress during the pandemic. Stress reactions showed a positive relationship with the amount of time spent following news about the COVID-19 outbreak. Asian adults coped with their stress by preparing safety equipment and extra daily commodities (62.4%) and by following government-issued public health measures (60.1%). Most Asian (71%) also frequently checked on the safety of family members and friends to keep each other safe. The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated stringent public health measures have largely increased the prevalence of substantial stress symptoms across multiple Asian regions. Governments should prepare this mental health pandemic and the associated social repercussions.",

    "abstract": "Background Information epidemiology based on internet search data can be used to model COVID-19 pandemic progressions and monitor population health literacy. However, the applicability of internet searches to monitor COVID-19 infections and public health awareness in South Asian countries are unclear. Objectives To assess the association of public interest and health literacy in COVID-19 with the actual number of infected cases for countries in South Asia. Methods Google Trends data from January to March 2020 were used to correlate public interest and health literacy with official data on COVID-19 cases using the relative search volume (RSV) index. Public interest in COVID-19 was retrieved in RSV indices with the search term Coronavirus (Virus). Similarly, an OR combination of search terms hand wash, face mask, hand sanitizer, face shield, and gloves were used to retrieve RSV indices as a surrogate of population health literacy in COVID-19. Daily confirmed COVID-19 cases were obtained from the COVID-19 data repository managed by the Johns Hopkins University. Country-level time-lag correlation analyses were performed for a time lag between 30 and +30 days. Results COVID-19-related worldwide public interest reached a peak on March 16, 2020, right after the WHO announcement of coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic. COVID-19 related public interest reached the highest peak in South Asian countries a few days after each county reported 100th confirmed cases. There were significant positive correlations between COVID-19 related public interest and daily laboratory-confirmed cases in countries expect Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka. The highest public interest in South Asian Countries was on average 12 days before the local maximum of new confirmed cases. Similarly, web searches related to personal hygiene and COVID-19 preventive measures in south Asia correlated to the number of confirmed cases as well as national restriction measures. Conclusion Public interest indicated by RSV indices can help to monitor the progression of an outbreak such as the current COVID-19 pandemic particularly in countries with a lack of diagnostic and surveillance capacity, and thereby distribute appropriate health information to the general public.",

    "abstract": "Background: Health Care Workers (HCWs) of diagnostic laboratory handling COVID positive samples are at risk and need to take protective measures. Many protective materials were not available when the pandemic reached India forcing laboratory managers to take innovative measures to protect the laboratory staffs. Methods: We made face shields from OHP sheets and substitute of biosafety cabinets from cardboard boxes fitted with hypochlorite spraying devices. Here we present if these two in-house developed safety devices when incorporated in standard operating procedure (SOP) of laboratory safety were effective in clinical biochemistry laboratory of dedicated COVID hospitals. Results: We assessed contamination of laboratory surfaces (n=6) and rate of SARS-nCov-2 positivity from their nasal and throat swab by RT-PCR among laboratory personnel (n=18) after 14 days of their use along with other routine safety devices like use of gloves, surgical masks, OT gowns etc. These HCWs were checked regularly for signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and none had any signs and symptoms during these 14days. The SARS-nCov-2 test report was negative for the staff members and no surface contamination was detected. We conclude that innovative and cost effective protective devices can be built in-house with locally available resources and are effective in preventing the spread of COVID 19 among the staff working in clinical biochemistry laboratories. Conclusions: Laboratory managers in resource scarce areas need to be innovative to face such sudden safety challenges like COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "A mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of Coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) is proposed by incorporating self-protection behavior changes in the population. The disease-free equilibrium point is computed and its stability analysis is studied. The basic reproduction number(R 0 ) of the model is computed and the disease-free equilibrium point is locally and globally stable for R 0<1 and unstable for R 0 >1. Based on the available data the unknown model parameters are estimated using a combination of least square and Bayesian estimation methods for different countries. Using forward sensitivity index the model parameters are carried out to determine and identify the key factors for the spread of disease dynamics. From country to country the sensitive parameters for the spread of the virus varies. It is found out that the reproduction number depends mostly on the infection rates, the threshold value of the force of infection for a population, the recovery rates, and the virus decay rate in the environment. It is also demonstrated that control of the effective transmission rate (recommended human behavioral change towards self-protective measures) is essential to stop the spreading of the virus. Numerical simulations also show that the virus transmission dynamics depend mostly on those sensitive parameters.",

    "abstract": "Background: Bacterial superinfection as well as ventilation associated pneumonia (VAP) are both frequent events in critical care. During COVID-19 pandemic, usual diagnostic practices such as bronchoalveolar lavage and tracheal aspirate are limited due to their associated high risk of exposure for the operator. In order to set primary focus on the protection of health care personnel, a modified tracheal aspiration (M-TA) technique is developed and used for acquiring a lower respiratory tract of microbiological samples with a closed suction device. Method: Retrospective observational study to evaluate effectiveness of M-TA is conducted. Results: A total of 33 M-TA samples were analyzed. In 66,6% of the cases, results led to a change in medical decision making. A 100% accuracy was achieved regarding COVID-19 diagnosis and a 56% bacterial growth-rate in cultives where VAP was suspected. No health care personnel have developed symptoms nor tested positive for COVID-19 during or after sample collection. Conclusion: M-TA technique presented could be considered as a safe and effective procedure with low percentage of complications.",

    "abstract": "The ability to estimate protein-protein binding free energy in a computationally efficient via a physics-based approach is beneficial to research focused on the mechanism of viruses binding to their target proteins. Implicit solvation methodology may be particularly useful in the early stages of such research, as it can offer valuable insights into the binding process, quickly. Here we evaluate the potential of the related molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MMGB/SA) approach to estimate the binding free energy {Delta}Gbind between the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain and the human ACE2 receptor. The calculations are based on a recent flavor of the generalized Born model, GBNSR6. Two estimates of {Delta}Gbind are performed: one based on standard bondi radii, and the other based on a newly developed set of atomic radii (OPT1), optimized specifically for protein-ligand binding. We take the average of the resulting two {Delta}Gbind values as the consensus estimate. For the well-studied Ras-Raf protein-protein complex, which has similar binding free energy to that of the SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 complex, the consensus {Delta}Gbind = -11.8 {+/-} 1 kcal/mol, vs. experimental -9.7 {+/-} 0.2 kcal/mol.\n\nThe consensus estimates for the SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 complex is {Delta}Gbind = -9.4 {+/-} 1.5 kcal/mol, which is in near quantitative agreement with experiment (-10.6 kcal/mol). The availability of a conceptually simple MMGB/SA-based protocol for analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 /ACE2 binding may be beneficial in light of the need to move forward fast.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological and genetic studies on COVID-19 are hindered by inconsistent and limited testing policies to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, it was shown that it is possible to predict potential COVID-19 cases using cross-sectional self-reported disease-related symptoms. Using a previously reported COVID-19 prediction model, we show that it is possible to conduct a GWAS on predicted COVID-19 which benefits from a larger sample size in order to gain new insights into the genetic susceptibility of the disease. Furthermore, we find suggestive evidence that genetic variants for other viral infectious diseases do not overlap with COVID-19 susceptibility and that severity of COVID-19 may have a different genetic architecture compared to COVID-19 susceptibility. Our findings demonstrate the added value of using self-reported symptom assessments to quickly monitor novel endemic viral outbreaks in a scenario of limited testing. Should there be another outbreak of a novel infectious disease, then we recommend repeatedly collecting data of disease-related symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Background Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), a novel inflammatory marker, has been suggested to be able to predict the severity of COVID-19 patients. This systematic review aims to evaluate the association between PLR levels on admission and the severity of COVID-19 patients. Methods A systematic literature search was done on 23 July 2020 to identify peer-reviewed studies across four different databases (Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane Library), preprints from two databases (MedRxiv and SSRN), and grey literature from two databases (WHO COVID-19 Global Research Database and Center for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article). Research articles comparing the PLR value on admission in adult patients with COVID-19 with varying degrees of severity were included in the analysis. The following keywords were used for the search: 'COVID-19', 'PLR', 'severity', and 'mortality'. The inverse variance method was used to calculate the pooled effect standardized mean difference (SMD) along with its 95% confidence interval (CI). Results A total of seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, six of which were conducted in China. From a total of 998 participants included, 316 (31.7%) had severe diseases; and those in the severe group were generally older and had underlying diseases compared to the non-severe group. In comparison to non-severe patients, the meta-analysis showed that severe COVID-19 patients had higher PLR levels on admission (SMD 0.68; 95%CI 0.43-0.93; I2 =58%). Conclusion High PLR levels on admission were associated with severe COVID-19 cases. Therefore, on-admission PLR level is a novel, cost-effective, and readily available biomarker with a promising prognostic role for determining the severity of COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "Background: Emerging data suggest variability in susceptibility and outcome to Covid-19 infection. Identifying the risk-factors associated with infection and outcomes in cancer patients is necessary to develop healthcare recommendations. Methods: We analyzed electronic health records of the US National Veterans Administration healthcare system and assessed the prevalence of Covid-19 infection in cancer patients. We evaluated the proportion of cancer patients tested for Covid-19 and their confirmed positivity, with clinical characteristics, and outcome, and stratified by demographics, comorbidities, cancer treatment and cancer type. Results: Of 22914 cancer patients tested for Covid-19, 1794 (7.8%) were positive. The prevalence of Covid-19 was similar across all ages. Higher prevalence was observed in African-American (AA) (15%) compared to white (5.5%; P<.001), in Hispanic vs non-Hispanic population and in patients with hematologic malignancy compared to those with solid tumors (10.9% vs 7.7%; P<.001). Conversely, prevalence was lower in current smoker patients, patients with other co-morbidities and having recently received cancer therapy (<6 months). The Covid-19 attributable mortality was 10.9%. Highest mortality rates were observed in older patients, those with renal dysfunction, higher Charlson co-morbidity score and with certain cancer types. Recent (<6 months) or past treatment did not influence mortality. Importantly, AA patients had 3.5-fold higher Covid-19 attributable hospitalization, however had similar mortality rate as white patients. Conclusion: Pre-existence of cancer affects both susceptibility to Covid-19 infection and eventual outcome. The overall Covid-19 attributable mortality in cancer patients is affected by age, co-morbidity and specific cancer types, however, race or recent treatment including immunotherapy does not impact outcome.",

    "abstract": "Patients with signs of COVID-19 were tested with CDC approved diagnostic RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 using RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal/nasal swabs. In order to determine the variants of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in the state of Nevada, 200 patient specimens from COVID-19 patients were sequenced through our robust protocol for sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Our protocol enabled sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genome directly from the specimens, with even very low viral loads, without the need of culture-based amplification. This allowed the identification of specific nucleotide variants including those coding for D614G and clades defining mutations. These sequences were further analyzed for determining SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in the state of Nevada and their phylogenetic relationships with other variants present in the united states and the world during the same period of the outbreak. Our study reports the occurrence of a novel variant in the nsp12 (RNA dependent RNA Polymerase) protein at residue 323 (314aa of orf1b) to Phenylalanine (F) from Proline (P), present in the original isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1). This 323F variant is found at a very high frequency (46% of the tested specimen) in Northern Nevada. Functional significance of this unique and highly prevalent variant of SARS-CoV-2 with RdRp mutation is currently under investigation but structural modeling showed this 323aa residue in the interface domain of RdRp, which is required for association with accessory proteins. In conclusion, we report the introduction of specific SARS-CoV-2 variants at a very high frequency within a distinct geographic location, which is important for clinical and public health perspectives in understanding the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 while in circulation.",

    "abstract": "Background School closures are a well-established non-pharmaceutical intervention in the event of infectious disease outbreaks, and have been implemented in many countries across the world, including the UK, to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2. As governments begin to relax restrictions on public life there is a need to understand the potential impact that reopening schools may have on transmission. Methods We used data provided by the UK Department for Education to construct a network of English schools, connected through pairs of pupils resident at the same address. We used the network to evaluate the potential for transmission between schools, and for long range propagation across the network, under different reopening scenarios. Results Amongst the options evaluated we found that reopening only Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 (4-6 and 10-11 year olds) resulted in the lowest risk of transmission between schools, with outbreaks within a single school unlikely to result in outbreaks in adjacent schools in the network. The additional reopening of Years 10 and 12 (14-15 and 16-17 year olds) resulted in an increase in the risk of transmission between schools comparable to reopening all primary school years (4-11 year olds). However, the majority of schools presented low risk of initiating widespread transmission through the school system. Reopening all secondary school years (11-18 year olds) resulted in large potential outbreak clusters putting up to 50% of households connected to schools at risk of infection if sustained transmission within schools was possible. Conclusions Reopening secondary school years is likely to have a greater impact on community transmission than reopening primary schools in England. Keeping transmission within schools limited is essential for reducing the risk of large outbreaks amongst school-aged children and their household members.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn most countries, contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases are asked to quarantine for 14 days following exposure, to limit asymptomatic onward transmission. We assessed the merit of RT-PCR testing in reducing the length of quarantine, using the UK as a case study.\n\nMethodsWe used an agent-based model to simulate an exposed contacts contact tracing detecting delay, incubation period, probability to become symptomatic, infectivity profile, and time-varying PCR detection probability. Assuming self-isolation on symptom onset, we assess the impact of the current 14 day quarantine strategy for all exposed contacts on their onward transmission potential and compare to alternative quarantine lengths with or without PCR tests during quarantine.\n\nFindingsSelf-isolation on symptoms onset alone can prevent 39% (95% Uncertainty Interval for super spreading events: 34, 45%) of onward transmission from secondary cases. An additional 14 days post-exposure quarantine for all contacts reduces transmission by 70% (95% UI: 39, 90%). A negative PCR test taken upon tracing or 7 days after exposure can reduce transmission by 62% (95% UI: 40, 84%) or 68% (95% UI: 40, 88%) respectively. Halving contact tracing delays of currently 4 days reduces pre-tracing transmission potential from 26% (95% UI: 7, 56%) to 14% (95% UI: 5, 42%).\n\nInterpretationPCR testing may allow for a substantial reduction in quarantine needs or even replacing quarantine requirements with no or a small excess in transmission risk respectively. Reducing contact tracing delays can help prevent a substantial amount of transmission.\n\nFundingNational Institute for Health Research, UK Research and Innovation, Wellcome Trust, and EU Horizon 2020.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSDuring the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a standard 14-day quarantine period has been required from the day a contact was exposed to an index case to avert onwards transmission. This approach aims to avoid infected contacts returning to their normal life during their pre-symptomatic period. This strategy presents a crucial part in the global pandemic response to interrupt transmission chains, however it places considerable social and economic pressure on contacts. As case numbers are rapidly rising across Europe an effective, practical and widely accepted strategy to limit secondary transmission is key to the control of SARS-CoV-2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis of optimal strategies to reduce transmission from contact traced secondary cases.\n\nAdded value of this studyWe simulated the ability of different quarantine and testing strategies to reduce the transmission potential of secondary cases. We found that the common post-exposure quarantine period of 14 days is equally effective as PCR testing of contacts after 7 days of quarantine. PCR testing immediately on tracing with no quarantine requirements following a negative test result would avert slightly less transmission potential from secondary cases (62% vs 70%). Delays in identifying contacts and hence delayed quarantine as well as low adherence substantially reduces the ability to reduce secondary transmission.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceThe ability to test timely and at scale could shorten current delays in contact tracing and thereby reduce the risk for secondary transmission. Similarly, such testing capacity would allow to substantially shorten necessary quarantine periods and dampen the economic and social impact while potentially increasing compliance.",

    "abstract": "Background Since COVID19 was declared a pandemic, attempts have been made to monitor trends over time and to compare countries and regions. Insufficient testing for COVID19 underestimates the incidence and inflates the case/fatality proportion. Given the age and sex distribution of morbidity and mortality from COVID19, the underlying sex and age distribution of a population needs to be accounted for. The aim of this paper is to present a method for monitoring trends of COVID19 using adjusted mortality trend ratios (AMTR). Methods Age and sex mortality distribution of a reference population composed of the first 14,086 fatalities which occurred before the end of March and were reported in Europe by some countries were used to calculate age and sex specific mortality rates per 1,000,000 population. These were applied to each country population to calculate the expected deaths. Adjusted Mortality Trend Ratios (AMTRs) with 95% confidence intervals (C.I.) were calculated for selected European countries from 17/03/2020 to 22/06/2020 by dividing observed cumulative mortality, by expected mortality times the crude mortality of the reference population. These estimated the sex and age adjusted mortality for COVID19 per million population in each country. Results The cumulative mortality from COVID19, the crude mortality rates, and the AMTRs were calculated for each country and compared. United Kingdom, Italy, France and Spain registered the highest mortality in Europe. On 22/06/2020 in Europe the total mortality rate from COVID-19 was 352 per 1,000,000 inhabitants; and it was highest in Belgium (850 per 1,000,000 inhabitants) followed by Spain, UK, Italy, Sweden and France. When accounting for the underlying age and sex structure of each country, Belgium remained the single country experiencing the highest AMTR of 929 per million inhabitants on 22/06/2020; however Ireland (which had a CMR in line with the total European population) emerged as having experienced a much more important impact of COVID19 mortality with an AMTR of 550/million on 22/06/2020, higher than Sweden and Italy. Conclusions In understanding and managing the pandemic of COVID19, comparable international data is a priority. Our methods allow a fair comparison of mortality in space and over time. The authors urge the WHO, given the absence of age and sex-specific mortality data for direct standardisation, to adopt this method to estimate the comparative mortality from COVID19 pandemic worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: This is the first national study observing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthopaedic trauma with respect to referrals, operative caseload and mortality during the first six weeks (namely the \"golden peak weeks\") following the introduction of the national social distancing and lockdown measures from mid-March 2020. Design: A longitudinal, national, multi-centre, retrospective, observational, cohort study was conducted for the first six weeks from March 17, 2020 from start of the national social distancing and then lockdown compared to the same period in 2019 as a comparative baseline. Setting: Hospitals from seven major urban cities were recruited around the UK, including London, representing a comprehensive national picture of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and its lockdown at its peak. Participants: A total of 4840 clinical encounters were initially recorded. Exclusion criterion consisted of spinal pathology only. Post-exclusion, 4668 clinical encounters were recorded and analysed within the two timeframes. Main outcome measures: Primary outcomes included the number of acute trauma referrals and those undergoing operative intervention, patient demographics, mortality rates, and the proportion of patients contracting COVID-19. Secondary outcomes consisted of the mechanism of injury, type of operative intervention and proportion of aerosolising-generating anaesthesia utilised. Demographics for each patient was recorded along with underlying medical co-morbidities. Sub-group analysis compared mortalities between both cohorts. Statistical analyses included mean (+/-SD), risk and odds ratios, as well as Fisher's exact test to calculate the statistical significance (p = 0.05). Results: During the COVID-19 period there was a 34% reduction in acute orthopaedic trauma referrals compared to 2019 (1792 down to 1183 referrals), and 29.5% less surgical interventions (993 down to 700 operations). The mortality rate significantly (both statistically and clinically) more than doubled for both risk and odds ratios during the COVID period in all referrals (1.3% vs 3.8%, p=0.0005) and in those undergoing operative intervention (2.2% vs 4.9%, p=0.004). Moreover, mortality due to COVID-related complications (versus non-COVID causes) had greater odds by a factor of at least 20 times. The odds ratios of road traffic accidents, sporting injuries, infection, and lower limb injuries were significantly less (by a third to a half) during the COVID period; albeit, the odds of sustaining neck of femur fractures and having falls <1.5m increased by more than 50%. For the operative cohorts, there was a greater odds of aerosolising-generating anaesthesia (including those with superimposed regional blocks) by three-quarters as well as doubling of the odds of a Consultant acting as the primary surgeon. Nevertheless, the odds of open reduction and internal fixation reduced by a quarter whereas removal of metalwork or foreign bodies reduced by three-quarters. Six-week Kaplan-Meier survival probability analysis confirmed those patients with neck of femur fracture and pre-existing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease were most at risk of mortality during the COVID-19 era. Conclusion: Although there was a reduction of acute trauma referrals and those undergoing operative intervention, the mortality rate still more than doubled in odds during the peak of the pandemic compared to the same time interval one year ago. Elderly patients with neck of femur fractures and existing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular comorbidities were at the highest risk stratification for mortality. This was the first national study to assess impact of COVID-19 pandemic on acute Orthopaedic trauma and it will aid clinicians in counselling trauma patients of the increased risk of mortality during the era of COVID-19 as well as acting as a risk-prediction tool influencing policymaking as the pandemic continues with potential subsequent waves. Further studies after the lifting of the lockdown are also required to observe for return of standard practice.",

    "abstract": "A growing body of evidence shows that poor vitamin D status has been associated with an increased susceptibility to viral and bacterial respiratory infections. In this study, we aimed to examine the association between vitamin D and COVID-19 risk and outcomes, and to explore potential causal effects. We used logistic regression to identify associations between different vitamin D variables (25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (25-OHD), ambient UVB and genetically-predicted 25-OHD concentrations) and COVID-19 (risk of infection, hospitalisation and death) in 495,780 participants from UK Biobank. We subsequently performed a Mendelian Randomisation (MR) study to test if there was any causal effect. In total, 1,746 COVID-19 cases and 399 COVID-19 deaths occurred between March and June 2020. We found significant inverse associations between COVID-19 infection and 25-OHD in univariable models, but these associations were non-significant after adjustment for confounders. Ambient UVB was strongly and inversely associated with hospitalization and death. Although the main MR analysis showed that genetically-predicted vitamin D levels were not causally associated with COVID-19 risk, MR sensitivity analysis using weighted mode method indicated a potential causal effect (OR=0.72, 95% CI:0.53-0.98; P=0.041). In conclusion, our study found suggestive evidence of association between vitamin D and the risk or severity of COVID-19 but further studies are needed.",

    "abstract": "Introduction The shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) across the country has been widely discussed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, recent reports indicate that PPE shortages persist amidst continually increasing caseloads nationwide. Additionally, there have been reports of poor-fitting masks, a problem which is magnified by shortages. The lack of adequate access to conventional N95 masks pushed for some to pursue 3D printing and locally distributing their own manufactured masks as substitutes when PPE, including N95 masks, were not readily available. The design presented, the snorkel mask adapter, is one such design born from the local maker community in partnership with local physicians and hospitals. This article discusses the design, manufacturing, and validation of the snorkel mask adapter and its immediate use in the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future use as stopgap PPE. Methods The design presented is an adapter which can be used with a commercially available snorkel mask in order to serve as a full face respirator in either the case of a PPE shortage or more pertinently for those who are unable to pass fit testing with the available N95 respirators at their respective facilities. Mask components were 3D printed, assembled, and then fit tested by qualitative fit testing (QLFT) at The University of Kansas Health System (TUKHS) in Kansas City, KS as a proof of concept.   Results At TUKHS, the mask was fit tested on 22 individuals who required an N95 mask but were not able to pass qualitative fit testing with the masks available to them at the time. Of the 22 tested, all 22 of them were able to pass QLFT with the snorkel mask, adapter, and viral/bacterial filter combination. Conclusion The results of the fit testing at TUKHS is promising for this N95 alternative. More extensive testing can and should be done, including quantitative fit testing. Persistently increasing caseloads and PPE shortages necessitates an urgent dissemination of these preliminary results. The authors do not advocate for this design as a replacement of traditional N95 masks or other PPE but do endorse this design as a stopgap measure, proven to be effective in situations of dire PPE shortage or for individuals who have failed fit testing with conventional PPE.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory disease that has been classified as a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO). The sudden spike in the number of infections and high mortality rates have put immense pressure on the public medical systems. Hence, it is crucial to identify the key factors of mortality that yield high accuracy and consistency to optimize patient treatment strategy. This study uses machine learning methods to identify a powerful combination of five features that help predict mortality with 96% accuracy: neutrophils, lymphocytes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and age. Various machine learning algorithms have been compared to achieve a consistent high accuracy across the days that span the disease. Robust testing with three cases confirm the strong predictive performance of the proposed model. The model predicts with an accuracy of 90% as early as 16 days before the outcome. This study would help accelerate the decision making process in healthcare systems for focused medical treatments early and accurately.",

    "abstract": "Background: Calls are increasing for widespread SARS-CoV-2 infection testing of people from populations with a very low prevalence of infection. We quantified the impact of less than perfect diagnostic test accuracy on populations, and on individuals, in low prevalence settings, focusing on false positives and the role of confirmatory testing. Methods: We developed a simple, interactive tool to assess the impact of different combinations of test sensitivity, specificity and infection prevalence in a notional population of 100,000. We derived numbers of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives, positive predictive value (PPV, the percentage of test positives that are true positives) and overall test accuracy for three testing strategies: (1) single test for all; (2) add repeat testing in test positives; (3) add further repeat testing in those with discrepant results. We also assessed the impact on test results for individuals having one, two or three tests under these three strategies. Results: With sensitivity of 80%, infection prevalence of 1 in 2,000, and specificity 99.9% on all tests, PPV in the tested population of 100,000 will be only 29% with one test, increasing to >99.5% (100% when rounded to the nearest %) with repeat testing in strategies 2 or 3. More realistically, if specificity is 95% for the first and 99.9% for subsequent tests, single test PPV will be only 1%, increasing to 86% with repeat testing in strategy 2, or 79% with strategy 3 (albeit with 6 fewer false negatives than strategy 2). In the whole population, or in particular individuals, PPV increases as infection becomes more common in the population but falls to unacceptably low levels with lower test specificity. Conclusion: To avoid multiple unnecessary restrictions on whole populations, and in particular individuals, from widespread population testing for SARS-CoV-2, the crucial roles of extremely high test specificity and of confirmatory testing must be fully appreciated and incorporated into policy decisions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPeople of color in the U.S. have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of rates of infection and morbidity. Explanations for these disparities include over-representation as essential workers and long-standing inequities in access to health services. Prior to the pandemic, racial discrimination has been associated with depression and general anxiety. However, the effect of discrimination and racial bias specific to the Coronavirus on mental health has not been examined. The aim of this study was to assess the effects Coronavirus victimization distress and Coronavirus racial bias beliefs on the mental health of young adult people of color.\n\nMethodAn online survey administered to a national sample of 350 Black, Indigenous and Latinx adults (18 - 25 years) included Coronavirus health risks, prescription and financial security, measure of depression and anxiety and 2 new psychometrically validated measures for Coronavirus related victimization distress and racial bias.\n\nResultsEmployment, number of Coronavirus health risks, Coronavirus victimization distress and Coronavirus racial bias were positively correlated with each other and with depression and anxiety. By contrast, household income and perceived financial and prescription security were negatively correlated with Coronavirus victimization, Coronavirus racial bias and with the mental health indices. Structural equation modeling controlling for demographic variables indicated perceived Coronavirus racial bias mediated the effect of Coronavirus victimization distress on both mental health measures across all groups.\n\nConclusionsResults suggest the COVID-19 pandemic has created new pathways to mental health disparities among young adults of color by reversing formerly protective factors such as employment, and by exacerbating structural and societal inequities linked to race. Findings highlight the necessity of creating mental health services tailored to the specific needs of racial/ethnic minorities during the current and future health crises.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for robust data linkage systems and methods for identifying outbreaks of disease in near real-time. Using self-reported app data and the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank, we demonstrate the use of sophisticated spatial modelling for near-real-time prediction of COVID-19 prevalence at small-area resolution to inform strategic government policy areas. A pre-requisite to an effective control strategy is that predictions need to be accompanied by estimates of their precision, to guard against over-reaction to potentially spurious features of 'best guess' predictions. In the UK, important emerging risk-factors such as social deprivation or ethnicity vary over small distances, hence risk needs to be modelled at fine spatial resolution to avoid aggregation bias. We demonstrate that existing geospatial statistical methods originally developed for global health applications are well-suited to this task and can be used in an anonymised databank environment, thus preserving the privacy of the individuals who contribute their data.",

    "abstract": "Background: Severe Acute Respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in Wuhan, China, has turned into a pandemic. All countries have implemented multiple strategies to try mitigating the losses caused by this virus. To stop the rapid spread of the disease and in compliance with the World Health Organizations social distancing policy, the government of Bangladesh has implemented a number of strategies, one of which is to limit the spread of the virus in hospitals by postponing elective procedures and providing only emergency services in the hospitals. The objective of this survey was to assess the current status of pediatric surgical procedures in different hospitals in Bangladesh and assess the effects of the current restrictions along with their implications in the long run. Materials and Methods: A survey was performed among doctors from public and private hospitals in Bangladesh to evaluate the status on pediatric surgery. Results: The results clearly revealed the lack of a significant reduction in doctors exposure to SARS-CoV-2 by postponing elective procedures. Conclusion: Keeping in mind the socioeconomic and health care conditions of the country, the author recommend resuming elective surgical procedures.

    "abstract": "Background England, UK has experienced a large outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection. As in USA and elsewhere, disadvantaged communities have been disproportionately affected. Methods National REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-2 (REACT-2) seroprevalence study using self-administered lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test for IgG among a random population sample of 100,000 adults over 18 years in England, 20 June to 13 July 2020. Results Completed questionnaires were available for 109,076 participants, yielding 5,544 IgG positive results and adjusted (for test performance), re-weighted (for sampling) prevalence of 6.0% (95% CI: 5.8, 6.1). Highest prevalence was in London (13.0% [12.3, 13.6]), among people of Black or Asian (mainly South Asian) ethnicity (17.3% [15.8, 19.1] and 11.9% [11.0, 12.8] respectively) and those aged 18-24 years (7.9% [7.3, 8.5]). Care home workers with client-facing roles had adjusted odds ratio of 3.1 (2.5, 3.8) compared with non-essential workers. One third (32.2%, [31.0-33.4]) of antibody positive individuals reported no symptoms. Among symptomatic cases, the majority (78.8%) reported symptoms during the peak of the epidemic in England in March (31.3%) and April (47.5%) 2020. We estimate that 3.36 million (3.21, 3.51) people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in England to end June 2020, with an overall infection fatality ratio of 0.90% (0.86, 0.94). Conclusion The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection in England disproportionately affected ethnic minority groups and health and care home workers. The higher risk of infection in these groups may explain, at least in part, their increased risk of hospitalisation and mortality from COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: To identify putative COVID-19 treatments and identify the roles of immunomodulators and antivirals in disease management. Design: Systematic review. Data sources: PubMed, bioRxiv.org and medRxiv.org were searched for studies suggestive of effective treatments for COVID-19. Additional studies were identified via a snowballing method applied to the references of retrieved papers as well as a subsequent targeted search for drug names. Review methods: Inclusion criteria included any case series or randomised control trials in any language that were published from 18th December 2019 to 18th April 2020 and described COVID-19 treatment. Of an initial 2140 studies identified from the initial search, 29 studies were found to meet the inclusion criteria and included in this comprehensive systematic review. Results: 19 studies of antiviral treatments for COVID-19 have been reported and seven studies for immunomodulatory treatments. Six randomised controlled trials have been published with one positive trial for Hydroxychloroquine. This small study consisted of 31 patients though subsequent studies showed contradictory findings. All the remaining studies were observational studies, retrospective case reviews or non-randomised trials and these results are difficult to interpret due to methodological issues. Conclusions: To date, an impressive number of studies have been performed in a short space of time, indicative of a resilient clinical trials infrastructure. However, there is a lack of high quality evidence to support any novel treatments for COVID-19 to be incorporated into the current standard of care. The majority of the studies of treatments for COVID-19 could only be found in pre-print servers. Future clinical reviews should therefore be Comprehensive Systematic Reviews involving pre-print studies to prevent potential unnecessary replications of clinical studies.",

Objective: To assess the association between NSAID use and deaths from COVID-19 using OpenSAFELY, a secure analytical platform. Design: Two cohort studies (1st March-14th June 2020). Setting: Working on behalf of NHS England, we used routine clinical data from >17 million patients in England linked to death data from the Office for National Statistics. Participants: Study 1: General population (people with an NSAID prescription in the last three years). Study 2: people with rheumatoid arthritis/osteoarthritis. Exposures: Current NSAID prescription within the 4 months before 1st March 2020. Main Outcome and Measure: We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for COVID-19 related death in people currently prescribed NSAIDs, compared with those not currently prescribed NSAIDs, adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities and other medications. Results: In Study 1, we included 535,519 current NSAID users and 1,924,095 non-users in the general population. The crude HR for current use was 1.25 (95% CI, 1.07-1.46), versus non-use. We observed no evidence of difference in risk of COVID-19 related death associated with current use (HR, 0.95, 95% CI, 0.80-1.13) in the fully adjusted model. In Study 2, we included 1,711,052 people with rheumatoid arthritis/osteoarthritis, of whom 175,631 (10%) were current NSAID users. The crude HR for current use was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.36-0.52), versus non-use. In the fully adjusted model, we observed a lower risk of COVID-19 related death (HR, 0.78, 95% CI, 0.65-0.94) associated with current use of NSAID versus non-use. Conclusion and Relevance: We found no evidence of a harmful effect of NSAIDs on COVID-19 related deaths. Risks from COVID-19 do not need to influence decisions about therapeutic use of NSAIDs.",

    "abstract": "Background The number of confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases surge substantially in resource-poor settings within the fragile health system. Since there are no proven vaccine and treatment in place against the disease, controlling strategy mainly rely on preventive measures. However, data on the extent of implementing physical distancing and other preventive measures were under estimated. This study, therefore, investigated these gaps among people in Arba Minch town, southern Ethiopia. Methods We conducted a community based cross-sectional study in Arba Minch town; from 15-30 June 2020. Data were collected using interviewer administered questionnaire and checklist. Then, data were cleaned, coded and entered to EpiData version 4.4.2, and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Results Of the total participants (459), 43.6% achieved above the mean score (6) on preventive measures of COVID-19. Only 29.8% of participants kept the recommended physical distance, and surprisingly, in all public gathering places the distance was not kept totally. In addition, of the total participants, only 37.7% had face-mask use practice; 20.5% had hand sanitizer use practice, and 13.1% were measuring their body temperature every two weeks. Moreover, 42.5% of participants avoided attendance in public gatherings; 44.7% stopped touching their nose, eye and mouth; 55.6% practiced stay-at-home; and 60% had frequent hand washing practice. Majority of participants (66.7%) practiced covering their mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing; 68.2% had treatment seeking behavior if they experience flue like symptoms; 69.1% practiced isolating themselves while having flue like symptoms; and 89.3% avoided hand shaking. Conclusions The findings of this study suggest that physical distancing and other COVID-19 preventive measures were inadequately implemented among people in Arba Minch town. Thus, an urgent call for action is demanding to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 as early as possible before it brings a devastating impact.",

    "abstract": "Health inequalities across nations reinforce social and economic differences. The European Commission has outlined its commitment to reducing health inequalities. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a disruptive event with global, national, and local effects on every aspect of a societys life. Therefore, it is of interest to quantify and display health (in)equality induced by COVID-19 over time and on different geographic scales (global, continental, national, regional).\n\nWe aimed to perform a study of (in)equality regarding COVID-19 related data on infections and deaths using the Gini index (GI). A specific focus of our analysis is the (in)equality of infection fatality rates. The Gini index was developed to explore inequality in wealth within or between nations. It is a relative measure which quantifies the ratio of the mean absolute difference between non-negative numerical observations and their mean: GI=0 describes a situation where all values are equal, GI=1 corresponds to one single positive observation among all non-negative observations. We use global, nation- and statewide data to evaluate the inequality at different geographical scales. We also reflect on the suitability of the Gini index to monitor equality aspects of the pandemic.\n\nData from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic show a considerable amount of inequality in the global distribution of infections and deaths. Only few countries contribute largely to the total infection and death toll. Inequality may result from heterogeneous reporting systems, heterogeneous policy making to fight the pandemic, heterogeneous health systems, and demographic structures. Inequality decreases when going from continental to national or regional levels. Time trends at national level reflect local outbreaks. There is inequality in infection fatality rates, too. Because of equality of income or wealth within a society, low GIs ([&le;] 0.4) are related to positive connotations like fairness and justice. In the epidemiological setting, however, a GI=1 reflects the goal striven for: The epidemic is restricted to one region while the surroundings are not affected - the epidemic has failed to spread.\n\nWe used the Gini index to reflect inequality between incidence and death rates of nations or geographic regions. The interpretation of the differences between reported GIs is not straightforward. Furthermore, combined with the information presented by maps, the GI is a useful tool.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: With surging global demand for increased SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity, clinical laboratories seek automated, high-throughput molecular solutions, particularly for specimen types which do not rely upon supply of specialized collection devices or viral transport media (VTM). Saliva was evaluated as a diagnostic specimen for SARS-CoV-2 using the cobas SARS-CoV-2 Test on the cobas 6800 instrument. Methods: Saliva specimens submitted from various patient populations under investigation for COVID-19 from March-July 2020 were processed in the laboratory with sterile phosphate-buffered saline in a 1:2 dilution and vortexed with glass beads. The processed saliva samples were tested using a commercial assay for detection of the SARS-CoV-2 E gene (LightMix) in comparison to the cobas SARS-CoV-2 Test. Results: 22/64 (34.4%) of the saliva samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Positive and negative concordance between the LightMix and cobas assays were 100%. There was no cross-contamination of samples observed on the cobas 6800. The overall invalid rate for saliva on the cobas 6800 (1/128, 0.78%) was similar to the baseline invalid rate observed for nasopharyngeal swabs/VTM and plasma samples. Conclusions: Saliva is a feasible specimen type for SARS-CoV-2 testing on the cobas 6800, with potential to improve turnaround time and enhance testing capacity.",

    "abstract": "Background Contact patterns are the drivers of close-contacts infections, such as COVID-19. In an effort to control COVID-19 transmission in the UK, schools were closed on 23 March 2020. With social distancing in place, Primary Schools were partially re-opened on 1 June 2020, with plans to fully re-open in September 2020. The impact of social distancing and risk mitigation measures on childrens contact patterns is not known. Methods We conducted a structured expert elicitation of a sample of Primary Headteachers to quantify contact patterns within schools in pre-COVID-19 times and how these patterns were expected to change upon re-opening. Point estimates with uncertainty were determined by a formal performance-based algorithm. Additionally, we surveyed school Headteachers about risk mitigation strategies and their anticipated effectiveness. Results Expert elicitation provides estimates of contact patterns that are consistent with contact surveys. We report mean number of contacts per day for four cohorts within schools along with a range at 90% confidence for the variations of contacts among individuals. Prior to lockdown, we estimate that, mean numbers per day, younger children (Reception and Year 1) made 15 contacts [range 8..35] within school, older children (Year 6) 18 contacts [range 5..55], teaching staff 25 contacts [range 4..55) and non-classroom staff 11 contacts [range 2..27]. Compared to pre-COVID times, after schools re-opened the mean number of contacts were reduced by about 53% for young children, about 62% for older children, about 60% for classroom staff and about 64% for other staff. Contacts between teaching and non-teaching staff reduced by 80%, which is consistent with other independent estimates. The distributions of contacts per person are asymmetric indicating a heavy tail of individuals with high contact numbers. Conclusions We interpret the reduction in childrens contacts as a consequence of efforts to reduce mixing with interventions such as forming groups of children (bubbles) who are organized to learn together to limit contacts. Distributions of contacts for children and adults can be used to inform COVID-19 transmission modelling. Our findings suggest that while official DfE guidelines form the basis for risk mitigation in schools, individual schools have adopted their own bespoke strategies, often going beyond the guidelines.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 global crisis is facilitated by high virus transmission rates and high percentages of asymptomatic and presymptomatic infected individuals. Containing the pandemic hinged on combinations of social distancing and face mask use. Here we examine the efficacy of these measures, using an agent-based modeling approach that evaluates face masks and social distancing in realistic confined spaces scenarios. By explicitly considering different fractions of asymptomatic individuals, as well as a realistic hypothesis of face mask protection during inhaling and exhaling, we find that face masks are more effective than social distancing in curbing the infection. Importantly, combining face masks with even moderate social distancing provides optimal protection. The finding that widespread usage of face masks limits COVID-19 outbreaks can inform policies to reopening of social functions.\n\nAuthor summaryThe COVID-19 outbreak has created an enormous burden on the worldwide population. Among the various ways of preventing the spread of the virus, face masks have been proposed as a main way of reducing transmission. Yet, the interplay between the usage of face mask and other forms of Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention is still not completely clear. In this paper we introduce a stochastic individual-based model which aims at producing realistic scenarios of disease spread when mask wearing with different inward and outward efficacy and social distancing are enforced. The model elucidates the conditions which make the two forms of intervention synergistic in preventing the spread of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Background Hospital emergency departments play a crucial role in the initial management of suspected COVID-19 infection. We aimed to characterise patients attending emergency departments with suspected COVID-19, including subgroups based on sex, ethnicity and COVID-19 test results. Methods We undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 70 emergency departments across the United Kingdom (UK). We collected presenting data from 22446 people attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020. Outcomes were admission to hospital, COVID-19 result, organ support (respiratory, cardiovascular or renal), and death, by record review at 30 days. Results Adults were acutely unwell (median NEWS2 score 4) and had high rates of admission (67.1%), COVID-19 positivity (31.2%), organ support (9.8%) and death (15.9%). Children had much lower rates of admission (27.4%), COVID-19 positivity (1.2%), organ support (1.4%) and death (0.3%). Adult men and women presented in similar numbers (10210 versus 10506), but men were more likely to be admitted (72.9% v 61.4%), require organ support (12.2% v 7.7%) and die (18.7% v 13.3%). Black or Asian adults tended to be younger than White adults (median age 54, 50 and 67 years), were less likely to be admitted (60.8%, 57.3%, 69.6%) or die (11.9%, 11.2%, 16.8%), but were more likely to require organ support (15.9%, 14.3%, 8.9%) or have a positive COVID-19 test (40.8%, 42.1%, 30.0%). Adults admitted with confirmed COVID-19 had similar age and comorbidities (except chronic lung disease) to those who did not have COVID-19 confirmed, but were much more likely to need organ support (22.2% v 8.9%) or die (32.7% v 15.9%). Conclusions Important differences exist between patient groups presenting to the emergency department with suspected COVID-19. People with confirmed COVID-19 have a poor prognosis, compared with similar emergency admissions without confirmed COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Background: Recent studies suggested a link between long-term exposure to air-pollution and COVID-19 mortality. However, due to their ecological design, based on large spatial units, they neglect the strong localised air-pollution patterns, and potentially lead to inadequate confounding adjustment. We investigated the effect of long-term exposure to NO2 and PM2.5 on COVID-19 deaths up to June 30, 2020 in England using high geographical resolution. Methods: We included 38 573 COVID-19 deaths up to June 30, 2020 at the Lower Layer Super Output Area level in England (n=32 844 small areas). We retrieved averaged NO2 and PM2.5 concentration during 2014-2018 from the Pollution Climate Mapping. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to quantify the effect of air-pollution while adjusting for a series of confounding and spatial autocorrelation. Findings: We find a 0.5% (95% credible interval: -0.2%-1.2%) and 1.4% (-2.1%-5.1%) increase in COVID-19 mortality rate for every 1g/m3 increase in NO2 and PM2.5 respectively, after adjusting for confounding and spatial autocorrelation. This corresponds to a posterior probability of a positive effect of 0.93 and 0.78 respectively. The spatial relative risk at LSOA level revealed strong patterns, similar for the different pollutants. This potentially captures the spread of the disease during the first wave of the epidemic. Interpretation: Our study provides some evidence of an effect of long-term NO2 exposure on COVID-19 mortality, while the effect of PM2.5 remains more uncertain.

    "abstract": "Background Measurement of post-exertion oxygen saturation has been proposed to assess illness severity in suspected COVID-19 infection. We aimed to determine the accuracy of post-exertional oxygen saturation for predicting adverse outcome in suspected COVID-19. Methods We undertook an observational cohort study across 70 emergency departments during first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. We collected data prospectively, using a standardised assessment form, and retrospectively, using hospital records, from patients with suspected COVID-19, and reviewed hospital records at 30 days for adverse outcome (death or receiving organ support). Patients with post-exertion oxygen saturation recorded were selected for this analysis. Results We analysed data from 817 patients with post-exertion oxygen saturation recorded after excluding 54 in whom measurement appeared unfeasible. The c-statistic for post-exertion change in oxygen saturation was 0.589 (95% confidence interval 0.465 to 0.713), and the positive and negative likelihood ratios of a 3% or more desaturation were respectively 1.78 (1.25 to 2.53) and 0.67 (0.46 to 0.98). Multivariable analysis showed that post-exertion oxygen saturation was not a significant predictor of adverse outcome when baseline clinical assessment was taken into account (p=0.368). Secondary analysis excluding patients in whom post-exertion measurement appeared inappropriate resulted in a c-statistic of 0.699 (0.581 to 0.817), likelihood ratios of 1.98 (1.26 to 3.10) and 0.61 (0.35 to 1.07), and some evidence of additional prognostic value on multivariable analysis (p=0.019). Conclusions Post-exertion oxygen saturation provides modest prognostic information in the assessment of patients attending the emergency department with suspected COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Background: It is unclear whether HIV infection is associated with risk of COVID-19 death. We aimed to investigate this in a large-scale population-based study in England. Methods: Working on behalf of NHS England, we used the OpenSAFELY platform to analyse routinely collected electronic primary care data linked to national death registrations. People with a primary care record for HIV infection were compared to people without HIV. COVID-19 death was defined by ICD-10 codes U07.1 or U07.2 anywhere on the death certificate. Cox regression models were used to estimate the association between HIV infection and COVID-19 death, initially adjusted for age and sex, then adding adjustment for index of multiple deprivation and ethnicity, and finally for a broad range of comorbidities. Interaction terms were added to assess effect modification by age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities and calendar time. Results: 17.3 million adults were included, of whom 27,480 (0.16%) had HIV recorded. People living with HIV were more likely to be male, of black ethnicity, and from a more deprived geographical area than the general population. There were 14,882 COVID-19 deaths during the study period, with 25 among people with HIV. People living with HIV had nearly three-fold higher risk of COVID-19 death than those without HIV after adjusting for age and sex (HR=2.90, 95% CI 1.96-4.30). The association was attenuated but risk remained substantially raised, after adjustment for deprivation and ethnicity (adjusted HR=2.52, 1.70-3.73) and further adjustment for comorbidities (HR=2.30, 1.55-3.41). There was some evidence that the association was larger among people of black ethnicity (HR = 3.80, 2.15-6.74, compared to 1.64, 0.92-2.90 in non-black individuals, p-interaction=0.045) Interpretation: HIV infection was associated with a markedly raised risk of COVID-19 death in a country with high levels of antiretroviral therapy coverage and viral suppression; the association was larger in people of black ethnicity.",

    "abstract": "Control of the COVID-19 pandemic requires a detailed understanding of prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the population. Case-based surveillance is necessarily biased towards symptomatic individuals and sensitive to varying patterns of reporting in space and time. The real-time assessment of community transmission antigen study (REACT-1) is designed to overcome these limitations by obtaining prevalence data based on a nose and throat swab RT-PCR test among a representative community-based sample in England, including asymptomatic individuals. Here, we describe results comparing rounds 1 and 2 carried out during May and mid June / early July 2020 respectively across 315 lower tier local authority areas. In round 1 we found 159 positive samples from 120,620 tested swabs while round 2 there were 123 positive samples from 159,199 tested swabs, indicating a downwards trend in prevalence from 0.13% (95% CI, 0.11%, 0.15%) to 0.077% (0.065%, 0.092%), a halving time of 38 (28, 58) days, and an R of 0.89 (0.86, 0.93). The proportion of swab-positive participants who were asymptomatic at the time of sampling increased from 69% (61%, 76%) in round 1 to 81% (73%, 87%) in round 2. Although health care and care home workers were infected far more frequently than other workers in round 1, the odds were markedly reduced in round 2. Age patterns of infection changed between rounds, with a reduction by a factor of five in prevalence in 18 to 24 year olds. Our data were suggestive of increased risk of infection in Black and Asian (mainly South Asian) ethnicities. Using regional and detailed case location data, we detected increased infection intensity in and near London. Under multiple sensitivity analyses, our results were robust to the possibility of false positives. At the end of the initial lockdown in England, we found continued decline in prevalence and a shift in the pattern of infection by age and occupation. Community-based sampling, including asymptomatic individuals, is necessary to fully understand the nature of ongoing transmission.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: To estimate population-level associations between ethnicity and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality, and to investigate how ethnicity-specific mortality risk evolved over the course of the pandemic. Design: Retrospective cohort study using linked administrative data. Setting: England and Wales, deaths occurring 2 March to 15 May 2020. Participants: Respondents to the 2011 Census of England and Wales aged [&le;]100 years and enumerated in private households, linked to death registrations and adjusted to account for emigration before the outcome period, who were alive on 1 March 2020 (n=47,872,412). Main outcome measure: Death related to COVID-19, registered by 29 May 2020. Statistical methods: We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for ethnic minority groups compared with the White population using Cox regression models, controlling for geographical, demographic, socio-economic, occupational, and self-reported health factors. HRs were estimated on the full outcome period and separately for pre- and post-lockdown periods in the UK. Results: In the age-adjusted models, people from all ethnic minority groups were at elevated risk of COVID-19 mortality; the HRs for Black males and females were 3.13 [95% confidence interval: 2.93 to 3.34] and 2.40 [2.20 to 2.61] respectively. However, in the fully adjusted model for females, the HRs were close to unity for all ethnic groups except Black (1.29 [1.18 to 1.42]). For males, COVID-19 mortality risk remained elevated for the Black (1.76 [1.63 to 1.90]), Bangladeshi/Pakistani (1.35 [1.21 to 1.49]) and Indian (1.30 [1.19 to 1.43]) groups. The HRs decreased after lockdown for all ethnic groups, particularly Black and Bangladeshi/Pakistani females. Conclusions: Differences in COVID-19 mortality between ethnic groups were largely attenuated by geographical and socio-economic factors, although some residual differences remained. Lockdown was associated with reductions in excess mortality risk in ethnic minority populations, which has major implications for a second wave of infection or local spikes. Further research is needed to understand the causal mechanisms underpinning observed differences in COVID-19 mortality between ethnic groups.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is spreading widely across the globe right now. Majority of the countries are relying on models and studies such as stochastic simulations, AceMod model, neural networks-based models, exponential growth model,Weibull distribution model, and so on to forecast the number of COVID-19 cases in the coming months. The objective on utilizing these models is to ensure that strict measures can be enacted to contain the virus spread and also predict the resources required to deal with the pandemic as the disease spreads. In the past few months, several models were used to predict the infection rate for COVID-19. These models predicted the infection rates, recovery rate or death rates for the COVID-19 patients. All these different models took different approaches and different scenarios to predict the future rates. Now, that we know the real cases, we can check how accurate these models were. Some of these models were able to predict the near future quite close to the reality but most of them went astray. In this study, we review major forecasting models that were used in the context of India during country-wise lockdown and compare them. From these comparisons, we can see that while the advanced warning can be helpful in mitigating and preparing for an impending or ongoing epidemic, effects can be catastrophic if poorly fitting models are used for predictions.",

    "abstract": "Introduction. Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. On March 2, 2020, Indonesia announced the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. East Kalimantan will play an important role as the new capital of Indonesia. There is attention to the preparedness of East Kalimantan to respond to COVID-19. We report the characteristics of COVID-19 fatality cases in here. Methods. We retrospectively analyzed the fatality cases of COVID-19 patients from the East Kalimantan Health Office information system. All patients were confirmed COVID-19 by RT-PCR examination. Results. By July 31, 2020, 31 fatality cases of patients had been identified as having confirmed COVID-19 in East Kalimantan. The mean age of the patients was 55.1 + 9.2 years. Most of the patients were men (22 [71.0%]) with age more than 60 years old (14 [45.2%]). Balikpapan has the highest number of COVID-19 fatality cases from all regencies. Hypertension was the most comorbidities in the fatality cases of COVID-19 patients in East Kalimantan. Discussion. Older age and comorbidities still contributed to the fatality cases of COVID-19 patients in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease were underlying conditions for increasing the risk of COVID-19 getting into a serious condition. Conclusion. Active surveillance for people older than 60 years old and having underlying diseases is needed for reducing the case fatality rate of COVID-19 in East Kalimantan. Keywords. Comorbidity, fatality cases, COVID-19, Indonesia.",

    "abstract": "Objectives To develop and validate a pragmatic risk score to predict mortality for patients admitted to hospital with covid-19. Design Prospective observational cohort study: ISARIC WHO CCP-UK study (ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium [4C]). Model training was performed on a cohort of patients recruited between 6 February and 20 May 2020, with validation conducted on a second cohort of patients recruited between 21 May and 29 June 2020. Setting 260 hospitals across England, Scotland, and Wales. Participants Adult patients ([&ge;]18 years) admitted to hospital with covid-19 admitted at least four weeks before final data extraction. Main outcome measures In-hospital mortality. Results There were 34 692 patients included in the derivation dataset (mortality rate 31.7%) and 22 454 in the validation dataset (mortality 31.5%). The final 4C Mortality Score included eight variables readily available at initial hospital assessment: age, sex, number of comorbidities, respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, level of consciousness, urea, and C-reactive protein (score range 0-21 points). The 4C risk stratification score demonstrated high discrimination for mortality (derivation cohort: AUROC 0.79; 95% CI 0.78 - 0.79; validation cohort 0.78, 0.77-0.79) with excellent calibration (slope = 1.0). Patients with a score [&ge;]15 (n = 2310, 17.4%) had a 67% mortality (i.e., positive predictive value 67%) compared with 1.0% mortality for those with a score [&le;]3 (n = 918, 7%; negative predictive value 99%). Discriminatory performance was higher than 15 pre-existing risk stratification scores (AUROC range 0.60-0.76), with scores developed in other covid-19 cohorts often performing poorly (range 0.63-0.73). Conclusions We have developed and validated an easy-to-use risk stratification score based on commonly available parameters at hospital presentation. This outperformed existing scores, demonstrated utility to directly inform clinical decision making, and can be used to stratify inpatients with covid-19 into different management groups. The 4C Mortality Score may help clinicians identify patients with covid-19 at high risk of dying during current and subsequent waves of the pandemic. Study registration ISRCTN66726260",

    "abstract": "Objectives: To determine the trend in mortality risk over time in people with severe COVID-19 requiring critical care (high intensive unit [HDU] or intensive care unit [ICU]) management. Methods: We accessed national English data on all adult COVID-19 specific critical care admissions from the COVID-19 Hospitalisation in England Surveillance System (CHESS), up to the 29th June 2020 (n=14,958). The study period was 1st March until 30th May, meaning every patient had 30 days of potential follow-up available. The primary outcome was in-hospital 30-day all-cause mortality. Hazard ratios for mortality were estimated for those admitted each week using a Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for age (non-linear restricted cubic spline), sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and geographical region. Results: 30-day mortality peaked for people admitted to critical care in early April (peak 29.1% for HDU, 41.5% for ICU). There was subsequently a sustained decrease in mortality risk until the end of the study period. As a linear trend from the first week of April, adjusted mortality risk decreased by 11.2% (adjusted HR 0.89 [95% CI 0.87 - 0.91]) per week in HDU, and 9.0% (adjusted HR 0.91 [95% CI 0.88 - 0.94]) in ICU. Conclusions: There has been a substantial mortality improvement in people admitted to critical care with COVID-19 in England, with markedly lower mortality in people admitted in mid-April and May compared to earlier in the pandemic. This trend remains after adjustment for patient demographics and comorbidities suggesting this improvement is not due to changing patient characteristics. Possible causes include the introduction of effective treatments as part of clinical trials and a falling critical care burden.",

Here, we estimate the potential number of lives saved and life years gained if this treatment would be rolled out in the UK and globally, as well as its cost-effectiveness of implementing this intervention. We estimate that, for the UK, approximately 12,000 [4,250 - 27,000] lives could be saved by January 2021. Assuming that dexamethasone has a similar effect size in settings where access to oxygen therapies is limited, this would translate into approximately 650,000 [240,000 - 1,400,000] lives saved globally. If dexamethasone acts differently in these settings, the impact could be less than half of this value. To estimate the full potential of dexamethasone in the global fight against COVID-19, it is essential to perform clinical research in settings with limited access to oxygen and/or ventilators, e.g. in low and middle-income countries.",

    "abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic affects mortality directly through infection as well as through changes in the social, environmental and healthcare determinants of health. The impacts on mortality are likely to vary across countries in magnitude, timing, and age and sex composition. Here, we applied an ensemble of 16 Bayesian probabilistic models to vital statistics data, by age group and sex, to consistently and comparably estimate the impacts of the first phase of the pandemic on all-cause mortality for 17 industrialised countries. The models accounted for factors that affect death rates including seasonality, temperature, and public holidays, as well as for medium-long-term secular trends and the dependency of death rates in each week on those in preceding week(s). From mid-February through the end of May 2020, an estimated 202,900 (95% credible interval 179,400-224,900) more people died in these 17 countries than would have had the pandemic not taken place. Nearly three quarters of these excess deaths occurred in England and Wales, Italy and Spain, where less than half of the total population of these countries live. When all-cause mortality is considered, the total number of deaths, deaths per 100,000 people, and relative increase in deaths were similar between men and women in most countries. Further, in many countries, the balance of excess deaths changed from male-dominated early in the pandemic to being equal or female-dominated later on. Taken over the entire first phase of the pandemic, there was no detectable rise in all-cause mortality in New Zealand, Bulgaria, Hungary, Norway, Denmark and Finland and for women in Austria and Switzerland (posterior probability of an increase in deaths <90%). Women in Portugal and men in Austria experienced relatively small increases in all-cause mortality, with posterior probabilities of 90-99%. For men in Switzerland and Portugal, and both sexes in the Netherlands, France, Sweden, Belgium, Italy, Scotland, Spain and England and Wales, all-cause mortality increased as a result of the pandemic with a posterior probability >99%. After accounting for population size, England and Wales and Spain experienced the highest death toll, nearly 100 deaths per 100,000 people; they also had the largest relative (percent) increase in deaths (37% (95% credible interval 30-44) in England and Wales; 38% (31-44) in Spain). New Zealand, Bulgaria, Hungary, Norway, Denmark and Finland experienced changes in deaths that ranged from possible slight declines to increases of no more than 5%. The large impact in England and Wales stems partly from having experienced (together with Spain) the highest weekly increases in deaths, more than doubling in some weeks, and having had (together with Sweden) the longest duration when deaths exceeded levels that would be expected in the absence of the pandemic. The heterogeneous magnitude and character of the excess deaths due to the Covid-19 pandemic reflect differences in how well countries have managed the pandemic (e.g., timing, extent and adherence to lockdowns and other social distancing measures; effectiveness of test, trace and isolate mechanisms), and the resilience and preparedness of the health and social care system (e.g., effective facility and community care pathways; minimising spread of infection within hospitals and care homes, and between them and the community).",

    "abstract": "Background The number of proposed prognostic models for COVID-19, which aim to predict disease outcomes, is growing rapidly. It is not known whether any are suitable for widespread clinical implementation. We addressed this question by independent and systematic evaluation of their performance among hospitalised COVID-19 cases. Methods We conducted an observational cohort study to assess candidate prognostic models, identified through a living systematic review. We included consecutive adults admitted to a secondary care hospital with PCR-confirmed or clinically diagnosed community-acquired COVID-19 (1st February to 30th April 2020). We reconstructed candidate models as per their original descriptions and evaluated performance for their original intended outcomes (clinical deterioration or mortality) and time horizons. We assessed discrimination using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and calibration using calibration plots, slopes and calibration-in-the-large. We calculated net benefit compared to the default strategies of treating all and no patients, and against the most discriminating predictor in univariable analyses, based on a limited subset of a priori candidates. Results We tested 22 candidate prognostic models among a cohort of 411 participants, of whom 180 (43.8%) and 115 (28.0%) met the endpoints of clinical deterioration and mortality, respectively. The highest AUROCs were achieved by the NEWS2 score for prediction of deterioration over 24 hours (0.78; 95% CI 0.73-0.83), and a novel model for prediction of deterioration <14 days from admission (0.78; 0.74-0.82). Calibration appeared generally poor for models that used probability outcomes. In univariable analyses, admission oxygen saturation on room air was the strongest predictor of in-hospital deterioration (AUROC 0.76; 0.71-0.81), while age was the strongest predictor of in-hospital mortality (AUROC 0.76; 0.71-0.81). No prognostic model demonstrated consistently higher net benefit than using the most discriminating univariable predictors to stratify treatment, across a range of threshold probabilities. Conclusions Oxygen saturation on room air and patient age are strong predictors of deterioration and mortality among hospitalised adults with COVID-19, respectively. None of the prognostic models evaluated offer incremental value for patient stratification to these univariable predictors.",

    "abstract": "Background: Italy was the first country outside China to experience the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a significant health burden. This study presents an analysis of the excess mortality across the 107 Italian provinces, stratified by sex, age group, and period of the outbreak. Methods: The analysis was performed using a two-stage interrupted time series design using daily mortality data for the period January 2015 - May 2020. In the first stage, we performed province-level quasi-Poisson regression models, with smooth functions to define a baseline risk while accounting for trends and weather conditions and to flexibly estimate the variation in excess risk during the outbreak. Estimates were pooled in the second stage using a mixed-effects multivariate meta-analysis. Results: In the period 15 February - 15 May 2020, we estimated an excess of 47,490 (95% empirical confidence intervals: 43,984 to 50,362) deaths in Italy, corresponding to an increase of 29.5% (95%eCI: 26.8 to 31.9%) from the expected mortality. The analysis indicates a strong geographical pattern, with the majority of excess deaths occurring in northern regions, where few provinces experienced up to 800% increase during the peak in late March. There were differences by sex, age, and area both in the overall impact and in its temporal distribution. Conclusions: This study offers a detailed picture of excess mortality during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. The strong geographical and temporal patterns can be related to implementation of lockdown policies and multiple direct and indirect pathways in mortality risk.",

    "abstract": "Rationale: The impact of COVID-19 on patients with Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) has not been established. Objectives: To assess outcomes following COVID-19 in patients with ILD versus those without in a contemporaneous age, sex and comorbidity matched population. Methods: An international multicentre audit of patients with a prior diagnosis of ILD admitted to hospital with COVID-19 between 1 March and 1 May 2020 was undertaken and compared with patients, without ILD obtained from the ISARIC 4C cohort, admitted with COVID-19 over the same period. The primary outcome was survival. Secondary analysis distinguished IPF from non-IPF ILD and used lung function to determine the greatest risks of death. Measurements and Main Results: Data from 349 patients with ILD across Europe were included, of whom 161 were admitted to hospital with laboratory or clinical evidence of COVID-19 and eligible for propensity-score matching. Overall mortality was 49% (79/161) in patients with ILD with COVID-19. After matching ILD patients with COVID-19 had higher mortality (HR 1.60, Confidence Intervals 1.17-2.18 p=0.003) compared with age, sex and co-morbidity matched controls without ILD. Patients with a Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) of <80% had an increased risk of death versus patients with FVC [&ge;]80% (HR 1.72, 1.05-2.83). Furthermore, obese patients with ILD had an elevated risk of death (HR 1.98, 1.13-3.46). Conclusions: Patients with ILD are at increased risk of death from COVID-19, particularly those with poor lung function and obesity. Stringent precautions should be taken to avoid COVID-19 in patients with ILD.",

    "abstract": "Hyperinflammation and uncontrolled cytokine release, which can be seen in severe cases of COVID-19, require therapy to reduce the innate immune response without hindering necessary adaptive immune mechanisms. Here, we show results from the first in-human trials using non-invasive ultrasound stimulation of the spleen to reduce cytokine release in the context of both an acute response in healthy subjects and a chronic inflammatory condition in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Splenic ultrasound results in a reduction in TNF serum levels, as well as IL-1B; and IL-8 transcript levels in monocytes. There is also a down regulation of pathways involved in TNF and IL-6 production, and IFNgamma- and NFKB-regulated genes. Many of these cytokines or pathways are upregulated in COVID-19 patients. There is also a reduction in chemokine transcript levels and other components of the chemotactic response, suggesting that reduction of cellular migration may contribute to the therapeutic effects of ultrasound. There is no inhibition of the adaptive immune response with ultrasound treatment relating to antibody production. This is consistent with a pre-clinical animal model where enhanced antibody production was achieved with splenic ultrasound. Therefore, this new splenic ultrasound approach has the potential to treat acute and chronic hyper-inflammatory diseases, as it lowers cytokine levels without disrupting the normal adaptive immune response. Portable ultrasound technologies are currently being developed and translated to the clinic to treat various inflammatory disorders, with more recent efforts directed towards combatting the hyperinflammation or cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To report three patients infected with COVID-19 with severe respiratory syndrome requiring intubation, who developed acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Method: Patient data were obtained from medical records from the North Memorial Health Hospital, Robbinsdale, MN, USA Results: Three patients (two men and one woman, aged 38 - 63) presented with fatigue, cough and fever leading to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to COVID-19 infection requiring intubation and ventilatory support. Two patients were unresponsive, one with strong eye deviation to the left and the third patient had severe diffuse weakness. MRI in all patients showed findings consistent with ADEM. CSF showed elevated protein in all patients with normal cell count and no evidence of infection, including negative COVID-19 PCR. All three of the patients received Convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19. All patients were treated with intravenous corticosteroids and improved, although two responded minimally. Two patients treated with IVIG showed no further improvement. Conclusion: Neurological complications from COVID-19 are being rapidly recognized. Our three cases highlight the occurrence of ADEM as a postinfectious/immune mediated complication of COVID-19 infection, which may be responsive to corticosteroid treatment. Early recognition of this complication and treatment is important to avoid long term complications.",

    "abstract": "(1) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic poses substantial threats to Latinx farmworkers and other immigrants in food production and processing. Classified as essential, such workers cannot shelter at home. Therefore, knowledge and preventive behaviors are important to reduce COVID-19 spread in the community. (2) Methods: Respondents for 67 families with at least one farmworker (FWF) and 38 comparable families with no farmworkers (non-FWF) in North Carolina completed a telephone survey in May, 2020. The survey queried knowledge of COVID-19, perceptions of its severity, self-efficacy, and preventive behaviors. Detailed data were collected to document household members' social interaction and use of face coverings. (3) Results: Knowledge of COVID-19 and prevention methods was high in both groups, as was its perceived severity. Non-FWF had higher self-efficacy for preventing infection. Both groups claimed to practice preventive behaviors, though FWF emphasized social avoidance and non-FWF emphasized personal hygiene. Detailed social interactions showed high rates of inter-personal contact at home, at work, and in the community with more mask use in non-FWF than FWF. (4) Conclusions: Despite high levels of knowledge and perceived severity for COVID-19, these immigrant families were engaged in frequent interpersonal contact that could expose community members and themselves to COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "A global analysis of the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the dynamics of the spread of the COVID-19 indicates that these can be classified using the stringency index proposed by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker(OxCGRT) team. The world average for the coefficient that linearises the level of transmission with respect to the OxCGRT stringency index is s= 0.01{+/-}0.0017 (95%C.I.). The corresponding South African coefficient is s= 0.0078{+/-}0.00036 (95%C.I.), compatible with the world average. Here, we implement the stringency index for the recently announced 5-tier regulatory alert system. Predictions are made for the spread of the virus for each alert level. Assuming constant rates of recovery and mortality, it is essential to increase s. For the system to remain sub-critical, the rate with which s increases should outpace that of the decrease of the stringency index. Monitoring of s becomes essential to controlling the post-lockdown phase. Data from the Gauteng province obtained in May 2020 has been used to re-calibrate the model, where s was found increase by 20% with respect to the period before lockdown. Predictions for the province are made in this light.",

    "abstract": "Background: School closures are part of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic control measures in many countries, based on the assumption that children play a similar role in transmitting SARS-CoV-2 as they do in transmitting influenza. We therefore performed a SARS-CoV-2 seropraevalence-study in students and teachers to assess their role in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Methods: Students grade 8-11 and their teachers in 13 secondary schools in eastern Saxony, Germany, were invited to participate in the SchoolCoviDD19 study. Blood samples were collected between May 25th and June 30th, 2020. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG were assed using chemiluminescence immunoassay technology and all samples with a positive or equivocal test result were re-tested with two additional serological tests. Findings: 1538 students and 507 teachers participated in this study. The seropraevalence for SARS-CoV-2 was 0.6%. Even in schools with reported Covid-19 cases before the Lockdown of March 13th no clusters could be identified. 23/24 participants with a household history of COVID-91 were seronegative. By using a combination of three different immunoassays we could exclude 16 participants with a positive or equivocal results after initial testing. Interpretation: Students and teachers do not play a crucial role in driving the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a low prevalence setting. Transmission in families occurs very infrequently, and the number of unreported cases is low in this age group, making school closures not appear appropriate as a strategy in this low prevalence settings. Funding: This study was supported by a grant from the state of Saxony",

    "abstract": "Background. High number of SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests are available in different formats, detect different types of antibodies, and use different target proteins. Sensitivity of these tests varies and could be also related to clinical symptoms and testing time. Methods. Serum samples from 97 COVID-19 patients and 100 controls were tested with 9 antibody tests (SNIBE, Epitope, Euroimmun, Roche, Abbott, DiaSorin, Biosensor, LIPS N, and LIPS S-RBD). The results were analyzed in context of clinical data. Findings. Positivity rate was of tests was following: N-LIPS test (91.8% cases), Epitope (85.6%), Abbott and in-house LIPS S-RBD (both 84.5%), Roche (83.5%), Euroimmun (82.5%), DiaSorin (81.4%), SNIBE (70.1%), and Biosensor (64.9%). Agreement between tests varied (71-95%). Correlation between patient symptoms score and antibody value was test-dependent: varied from strongest in LIPS N (rho=0.41; p<0.001) to nonsignificant (LIPS S-RBD). Testing time from symptoms influenced sensitivity in some tests more than anothers. Interpretation. Sensitivity of tests varied highly and combination of different tests may improve it. Relation of results to symptoms and testing time was test-dependent. Thus, some antibody tests seems to be more sensitive to detect antibodies early and in asymptomatic patients than others. Funding. Study was funded by SYNLAB Estonia and Estonian Research Council grant PRG377.",

    "abstract": "Background: As the coronavirus cases continue to surge, the urgent need for universal testing to identify positive cases for effective containment of this highly contagious pandemic has become the center of attention worldwide. However, in spite of extensive discussions, very few places have even attempted to implement it. We evaluated the efficacy of widespread testing in creating a safe workplace in our healthcare community including staff and patients. Furthermore, we assessed the rate of new infections in patients undergoing electrophysiology (EP) procedure, to see if identification and exclusion of positive cases facilitated establishment of a risk-free operating environment. Methods: Universal testing was conducted in subjects with no symptoms of COVID-19 including patients and their caregivers and staff in our electrophysiology units along with the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) staff (n=1670) Results: Of 1670, 758 (45.4%) were EP patients, and the remaining 912 were caregivers, EMS staff and hospital staff from EP clinic and lab. Viral-RNA test revealed 64 (3.8%) positives in the population. A significant increase in the rate of positives was observed from April to June, 2020 (p=0.02). Procedures of positive cases (n=31) were postponed until they tested negative at retesting on day 14. Staff testing positive (n=33) were retested before going back to work after 2 weeks. Because of suspected exposure, 67 staff were retested and source was traced. No new infections were reported in patients during the hospital stay or within 2-weeks after the procedure. Conclusion: Universal testing to identify positive cases was helpful in creating and maintaining a safe working environment without exposing patients and staff to new infections in the EP unit at the hospital.",

    "abstract": "Importance. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a decline in admissions with cardiovascular (CV) emergencies. The fatal consequences of this are unknown. Objectives - To describe the place and causes of acute CV death during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design - Retrospective nationwide cohort. Setting - England and Wales. Participants - All adult (age [&ge;]18 years) acute CV deaths (n=580,972) between 1st January 2014 and 2nd June 2020. Exposure - The COVID-19 pandemic (defined as from the onset of the first COVID-19 death in England on 2nd March 2020). Main outcomes - Place (hospital, care home, home) and acute CV events directly contributing to death as stated on the first part of the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death. Results - After 2nd March 2020, there were 22,820 acute CV deaths of which 5.7% related to COVID-19, and an excess acute CV mortality of 1752 (+8%) compared with the expected daily deaths in the same period. Deaths in the community accounted for nearly half of all deaths during this period. Care homes had the greatest increase in excess acute CV deaths (1065, +40%), followed by deaths at home (1728, +34%) and in hospital (57, +0%). The most frequent cause of acute CV death during this period was stroke (8,290, 36.3%), followed by acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (5,532, 24.2%), heart failure (5,280, 23.1%), pulmonary embolism (2,067, 9.1%) and cardiac arrest (1,037, 4.5%). Deep vein thrombosis had the greatest increase in cause of excess acute CV death (18, +25%), followed pulmonary embolism (340, +19%) and stroke (782, +10%). The greatest cause of excess CV death in care homes was stroke (700, +48%), compared with cardiac arrest (80, +56%) at home, and pulmonary embolism (126, +14%) and cardiogenic shock (41, +14%) in hospital. Conclusions and relevance - The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an inflation in acute CV deaths above that expected for the time of year, nearly half of which occurred in the community. The most common cause of acute CV death was stroke followed by acute coronary syndrome and heart failure. This is key information to optimise messaging to the public and enable health resource planning.",

    "abstract": "Background: Rates of Covid-19 infection have declined in many countries, but outbreaks persist in residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) who are at high risk of severe outcomes. Epidemiological data from LTCFs are scarce. We used population-level active surveillance to estimate incidence of, and risk factors for Covid-19, and attributable mortality in elderly residents of LTCFs. Methods: Cohort study using individual-level electronic health records from 8,713 residents and daily counts of infection for 9,339 residents and 11,604 staff across 179 UK LTCFs. We modelled risk factors for infection and mortality using Cox proportional hazards and estimated attributable fractions. Findings: 2,075/9,339 residents developed Covid-19 symptoms (22.2% [95% confidence interval: 21.4%; 23.1%]), while 951 residents (10.2% [9.6%; 10.8%]) and 585 staff (5.0% [4.7%; 5.5%]) had laboratory confirmed infections. Confirmed infection incidence in residents and staff respectively was 152.6 [143.1; 162.6] and 62.3 [57.3; 67.5] per 100,000 person-days. 121/179 (67.6%) LTCFs had at least one Covid-19 infection or death. Lower staffing ratios and higher occupancy rates were independent risk factors for infection. 1,694 all-cause deaths occurred in 8,713 (19.4% [18.6%; 20.3%]) residents. 217 deaths occurred in 607 residents with confirmed infection (case-fatality rate: 35.7% [31.9%; 39.7%]). 567/1694 (33.5%) of all-cause deaths were attributable to Covid-19, 28.0% of which occurred in residents with laboratory-confirmed infection. The remainder of excess deaths occurred in asymptomatic or symptomatic residents in the context of limited testing for infection, suggesting substantial under-ascertainment. Interpretation: 1 in 5 residents had symptoms of infection during the pandemic, but many cases were not tested. Higher occupancy and lower staffing levels increase infection risk. Disease control measures should integrate active surveillance and testing with fundamental changes in staffing and care home occupancy to protect staff and residents from infection.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic in the UK was accompanied by excess all-cause mortality at a national level, only part of which was accounted for by known infections. Excess mortality has previously been described in people who had received care from the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM), a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in south London. The SLaM Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource receives 24-hourly updates from its full electronic health record, including regularly sourced national mortality on all past and present SLaM service users. The SLaM urban catchment has high levels of deprivation and is ethnically diverse, so the objective of the descriptive analyses reported in this manuscript was to compare mortality in SLaM service users from 16th March to 15th May 2020 to that for the same period in 2019 within specific ethnic groups: i) White British, ii) Other White, iii) Black African/Caribbean, iv) South Asian, v) Other, and vi) missing/not stated. For Black African/Caribbean patients (the largest minority ethnic group) this ratio was 3.33, compared to 2.47 for White British patients. Considering premature mortality (restricting to deaths below age 70), these ratios were 2.74 and 1.96 respectively. Ratios were also high for those from Other ethnic groups (2.63 for all mortality, 3.07 for premature mortality).",

    "abstract": "In May 2020 the UK introduced a Test, Trace, Isolate programme in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The programme was first rolled out on the Isle of Wight and included Version 1 of the NHS contact tracing app. We used COVID-19 daily case data to infer incidence of new infections and estimate the reproduction number R for each of 150 Upper Tier Local Authorities in England, and at the National level, before and after the launch of the programme on the Isle of Wight. We used Bayesian and Maximum-Likelihood methods to estimate R, and compared the Isle of Wight to other areas using a synthetic control method. We observed significant decreases in incidence and R on the Isle of Wight immediately after the launch. These results are robust across each of our approaches. Our results show that the sub-epidemic on the Isle of Wight was controlled significantly more effectively than the sub-epidemics of most other Upper Tier Local Authorities, changing from having the third highest reproduction number R (of 150) before the intervention to the tenth lowest afterwards. The data is not yet available to establish a causal link. However, the findings highlight the need for further research to determine the causes of this reduction, as these might translate into local and national non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies in the period before a treatment or vaccination becomes available.",

    "abstract": "Background: COCOA, a contact reporting application in Japan, was launched at the end of June 2020. Object: We assessed effectiveness of COCOA. Method: After developing a simple susceptible-infected-recovery model with COCOA and voluntary restrictions against going out (VRG), we assumed that COCOA can reduce infectiousness by 10-50% points through self-quarantine at home after receiving notification from COCOA. Results: COCOA alone is insufficient to halt an outbreak. Even if the entire population were to use COCOA, the reproduction number would be 1.31. However, if VRG were 15%, about half of the maximum VRG effectiveness under the emergency state declaration, then 10% COCOA use by a population can reduce the reproduction number to less than one. Conclusion: Significant effects of COCOA for reducing the reproduction number were found. However, without VRG, COCOA alone is insufficient to control an outbreak.",

    "abstract": "Background The role of health-related disparities including sociodemographic, environmental, and critical care capacity in the COVID-19 pandemic are poorly understood. In the present study, we characterized vulnerable populations located in areas at higher risk of COVID-19 related mortality and low critical healthcare capacity in the U.S. Methods Using Bayesian multilevel analysis and small area disease risk mapping, we assessed the spatial variation of COVID-19 related mortality risk for the U.S. in relation with healthcare disparities including race, ethnicity, poverty, air quality, and critical healthcare capacity. Results Overall, highly populated, regional air hub areas, and minorities had an increased risk of COVID-19 related mortality. We found that with an increase of only 1 ug/m3 in long term PM2.5 exposure, the COVID-19 mortality rate increased by 13%. Counties with major air hubs had 18% increase in COVID-19 related death compared to counties with no airport connectivity. Sixty-eight percent of the counties with high COVID-19 related mortality risk were also counties with lower critical care capacity than national average. These counties were primary located at the North- and South-Eastern regions of the country. Conclusion The existing disparity in health and environmental risk factors that exacerbate the COVID-19 related mortality, along with the regional healthcare capacity, determine the vulnerability of populations to COVID-19 related mortality. The results from this study can be used to guide the development of strategies for the identification and targeting preventive strategies in vulnerable populations with a higher proportion of minority groups living in areas with poor air quality and low healthcare capacity.",

    "abstract": "The risk of overwhelming healthcare systems from a second wave of COVID-19 is yet to be quantified. Here, we investigate the impact of different reopening scenarios of states around the U.S. on COVID-19 hospitalized cases and the risk of overwhelming the healthcare system while considering resources at the county level. We show that the second wave might involve an unprecedented impact on the healthcare system if an increasing number of the population becomes susceptible and/or if the various protective measures are discontinued. Furthermore, we explore the ability of different mitigation strategies in providing considerable relief to the healthcare system. The results can aid healthcare planners, policymakers, and state officials in making decisions on additional resources required and on when to return to normalcy.",

    "abstract": "Background England has experienced one of the highest rates of confirmed COVID-19 mortality in the world. SARS-CoV-2 virus has circulated in hospitals, care homes and the community since January 2020. Our current epidemiological knowledge is largely informed by clinical cases with far less understanding of community transmission. Methods The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) study is a nationally representative prevalence survey of SARS-CoV-2 virus swab-positivity in the community in England. We recruited participants regardless of symptom status. Results We found 159 positives from 120,610 swabs giving an average prevalence of 0.13% (95% CI: 0.11%,0.15%) from 1st May to 1st June 2020. We showed decreasing prevalence with a halving time of 8.6 (6.2, 13.6) days, implying an overall reproduction number R of 0.57 (0.45, 0.72). Adults aged 18 to 24 yrs had the highest swab-positivity rates, while those >64 yrs had the lowest. Of the 126 participants who tested positive with known symptom status in the week prior to their swab, 39 reported symptoms while 87 did not, giving an estimate that 69% (61%,76%) of people were symptom-free for the 7 days prior testing positive in our community sample. Symptoms strongly associated with swab-positivity were: nausea and/or vomiting, diarrhoea, blocked nose, loss of smell, loss of taste, headache, chills and severe fatigue. Recent contact with a known COVID-19 case was associated with odds of 24 (16, 38) for swab-positivity. Compared with non-key workers, odds of swab-positivity were 7.7 (2.4, 25) among care home (long-term care facilities) workers and 5.2 (2.9, 9.3) among health care workers. However, some of the excess risk associated with key worker status was explained by recent contact with COVID-19 cases. We found no strong evidence for geographical variability in positive swab results. Conclusion Our results provide a reliable baseline against which the impact of subsequent relaxation of lockdown can be assessed to inform future public health efforts to control transmission.",

    "abstract": "Background: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic affects cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) directly through infection and indirectly through health service reorganisation and public health policy. Real-time data are needed to quantify direct and indirect effects. We aimed to monitor hospital activity for presentation, diagnosis and treatment of CVDs during the pandemic to inform on indirect effects. Methods: We analysed aggregate data on presentations, diagnoses and treatments or procedures for selected CVDs (acute coronary syndromes, heart failure, stroke and transient ischaemic attack, venous thromboembolism, peripheral arterial disease and aortic aneurysm) in UK hospitals before and during the COVID-19 epidemic. We produced an online visualisation tool to enable near real-time monitoring of trends. Findings: Nine hospitals across England and Scotland contributed hospital activity data from 28 Oct 2019 (pre-COVID-19) to 10 May 2020 (pre-easing of lockdown), and for the same weeks during 2018-2019. Across all hospitals, total admissions and emergency department (ED) attendances decreased after lockdown (23 March 2020) by 57.9% (57.1-58.6%) and 52.9% (52.2-53.5%) respectively compared with the previous year. Activity for cardiac, cerebrovascular and other vascular conditions started to decline 1-2 weeks before lockdown, and fell by 31-88% after lockdown, with the greatest reductions observed for coronary artery bypass grafts, carotid endarterectomy, aortic aneurysm repair and peripheral arterial disease procedures. Compared with before the first UK COVID-19 (31 January 2020), activity declined across diseases and specialties between the first case and lockdown (total ED attendances RR 0.94, 0.93-0.95; total hospital admissions RR 0.96, 0.95-0.97) and after lockdown (attendances RR 0.63, 0.62-0.64; admissions RR 0.59, 0.57-0.60). There was limited recovery towards usual levels of some activities from mid-April 2020. Interpretation: Substantial reductions in total and cardiovascular activities are likely to contribute to a major burden of indirect effects of the pandemic, suggesting they should be monitored and mitigated urgently.",

    "abstract": "Background. People of minority ethnic background may be disproportionately affected by severe COVID-19 for reasons that are unclear. We sought to examine the relationship between ethnic background and (1) hospital admission for severe COVID-19; (2) in-hospital mortality. Methods. We conducted a case-control study of 872 inner city adult residents admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 (cases) and 3,488 matched controls randomly sampled from a primary healthcare database comprising 344,083 people resident in the same region. To examine in-hospital mortality, we conducted a cohort study of 1827 adults consecutively admitted with COVID-19. Data collected included hospital admission for COVID-19, demographics, comorbidities, in-hospital mortality. The primary exposure variable was self-defined ethnicity. Results. The 872 cases comprised 48.1% Black, 33.7% White, 12.6% Mixed/Other and 5.6% Asian patients. In conditional logistic regression analyses, Black and Mixed/Other ethnicity were associated with higher admission risk than white (OR 3.12 [95% CI 2.63-3.71] and 2.97 [2.30- 3.85] respectively). Adjustment for comorbidities and deprivation modestly attenuated the association (OR 2.28 [1.87-2.79] for Black, 2.66 [2.01-3.52] for Mixed/Other). Asian ethnicity was not associated with higher admission risk (OR 1.20 [0.86-1.66]). In the cohort study of 1827 patients, 455 (28.9%) died over a median (IQR) of 8 (4-16) days. Age and male sex, but not Black (adjusted HR 0.84 [0.63-1.11]) or Mixed/Other ethnicity (adjusted HR 0.69 [0.43-1.10]), were associated with in-hospital mortality. Asian ethnicity was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (adjusted HR 1.54 [0.98-2.41]). Conclusions. Black and Mixed ethnicity are independently associated with greater admission risk with COVID-19 and may be risk factors for development of severe disease. Comorbidities and socioeconomic factors only partly account for this and additional ethnicity-related factors may play a large role. The impact of COVID-19 may be different in Asians.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: First, to describe adolescents' health information sources and knowledge, health literacy (HL), health protective measures, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) during the initial phase of the Covid-19 pandemic in Norway. Second, to investigate the association between HL and the knowledge and behavior relevant for preventing spread of the virus. Third, to explore variables associated with HRQoL in a pandemic environment. Methods: This cross-sectional study includes survey data from 2,205 Norwegian adolescents 16-19 years of age. The participants reported on their health information sources, HL, handwashing knowledge and behavior, number of social interactions, and HRQoL. Associations between study variables and specified outcomes were explored using multiple linear and logistic regression analyses. Results: Television (TV) and family were indicated to be the main sources for pandemic-related health information. Handwashing, physical distancing, and limiting the number of social contacts were the most frequently reported measures. HL and handwashing knowledge and HL and handwashing behavior were significantly associated. For each unit increase on the HL scale, the participants were 5% more likely to socialize less with friends in comparison to normal. The mean HRQoL was very poor compared to European norms. Being quarantined or isolated and having confirmed or suspected Covid-19 were significantly negatively associated with HRQoL, but seeing less friends than normal was not associated. HL was significantly positively associated with HRQoL, albeit of minor clinical importance. Conclusion: Adolescents follow the health authorities' guidelines and appear highly literate. However, high fidelity requires great sacrifice because the required measures seem to collide with certain aspects that are important for the adolescents' HRQoL.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To estimate the percentage of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) over time in the community in England and to quantify risk factors. Design: Repeated cross-sectional surveys of population-representative households with longitudinal follow-up if consent given. Setting: England. Participants: 34,992 Individuals aged 2 years and over from 16,722 private residential households. Data were collected in a pilot phase of the survey between 26 April and 28 June 2020. Main outcome measures: Percentage of individuals in the community testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using throat and nose swabs. Individuals were asked about any symptoms and potential risk factors. Results: The percentage of people in private-residential households testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 reduced from 0.32% (95% credible interval (CrI) 0.19% to 0.52%) on 26 April to 0.08% (95% CrI 0.05% to 0.12%) on 28 June, although the prevalence stabilised near the end of the pilot. Factors associated with an increased risk of testing positive included having a job with direct patient contact (relative exposure (RE) 4.06, 95% CrI 2.42 to 6.77)), working outside the home (RE 2.49, 95% CrI 1.39 to 4.45), and having had contact with a hospital (RE 2.20, 95% CrI 1.09 to 4.16 for having been to a hospital individually and RE 1.95, 95% CrI 0.81 to 4.09 for a household member having been to a hospital). In 133 visits where individuals tested positive, 82 (61%, 95% CrI 53% to 69%) reported no symptoms, stably over time. Conclusion: The percentage of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals declined between 26 April and 28 June 2020. Positive tests commonly occurred without symptoms being reported. Working outside your home was an important risk factor, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be essential for early detection of increases in infections following return to work and other relaxations of control measures.",

    "abstract": "Background: University campuses present an ideal environment for viral spread and are therefore at extreme risk of serving as a hotbed for a COVID-19 outbreak. While active surveillance throughout the semester such as widespread testing, contact tracing, and case isolation, may assist in detecting and preventing early outbreaks, these strategies will not be sufficient should a larger outbreak occur. It is therefore necessary to limit the initial number of active cases at the start of the semester. We examine the impact of pre-semester NAT testing on disease spread in a university setting. Methods: We implement simple dynamic transmission models of SARS-CoV-2 infection to explore the effects of pre-semester testing strategies on the number of active infections and occupied isolation beds throughout the semester. We assume an infectious period of 3 days and vary R0 to represent the effectiveness of disease mitigation strategies throughout the semester. We assume the prevalence of active cases at the beginning of the semester is 5%. The sensitivity of the NAT test is set at 90%. Results: If no pre-semester screening is mandated, the peak number of active infections occurs in under 10 days and the size of the peak is substantial, ranging from 5,000 active infections when effective mitigation strategies (R0 = 1.25) are implemented to over 15,000 active infections for less effective strategies (R0 = 3). When one NAT test is mandated within one week of campus arrival, effective (R0 = 1.25) and less effective (R0 = 3) mitigation strategies delay the onset of the peak to 40 days and 17 days, respectively, and result in peak size ranging from 1,000 to over 15,000 active infections. When two NAT tests are mandated, effective (R0 = 1.25) and less effective (R0 = 3) mitigation strategies delay the onset of the peak through the end of fall semester and 20 days, respectively, and result in peak size ranging from less than 1,000 to over 15,000 active infections. If maximum occupancy of isolation beds is set to 2% of the student population, then isolation beds would only be available for a range of 1 in 2 confirmed cases (R0 = 1.25) to 1 in 40 confirmed cases (R0 = 3) before maximum occupancy is reached. Conclusion: Even with highly effective mitigation strategies throughout the semester, inadequate pre-semester testing will lead to early and large surges of the disease and result in universities quickly reaching their isolation bed capacity. We therefore recommend NAT testing within one week of campus return. While this strategy is sufficient for delaying the timing of the outbreak, pre-semester testing would need to be implemented in conjunction with effective mitigation strategies to reduce the outbreak size.",

    "abstract": "Rationale: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can cause a viral pneumonia together with other extrapulmonary complications. Acute cardiac related injury (ACRI) is common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Objective: To explain the pathological mechanism of ACRI and improve the treatment strategy by retrospectively observing the factors associated with ACRI and factors affecting the prognosis of ACRI with COVID-19 at an early stage. Methods: 619 COVID-19 patients were from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan. T test was used for continuous variables while Chi-square test for categorical factors. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were applied to estimate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Among the 619 OOS Level-I hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 102 (16.5%) were defined as ACRI (stage-1: 59 cases, stage-2: 43 cases). 50% of ACRI patients developed into severe cases and 25 patients died (CFR=24.5%), 42 times that of non-ACRI patients. Elderly (OR=2.83, P<0.001) , HTN (OR=2.09, P=0.005), {gamma}-globulin (OR=2.08, P=0.004), TCM (OR=0.55, P=0.017), PLT (OR=2.94, P<0.001) and NLR (OR=2.20, P=0.004) were independently correlated with ACRI. SBP[&ge;]140, dyspnea, DM, smoking history were correlated with ACRI-stage2 only. In the prognostic subgroup analysis of ACRI patients,{gamma}-globulin treatment could prolong LOS. TCM (OR=0.26, P=0.006), SBP[&ge;]160 (OR= 22.70, P=0.005), male (OR=2.66, P=0.044) were associated with severe illness while corticosteroids treatment (OR=3.34, P=0.033) and male (OR=4.303, P=0.008) with death. Surprisingly, we found the mortality of non-elderly patients is higher than elderly (32.4% VS 20.0%, P=0.164), and both IKF and RASI treatment were not correlated with any prognostic indicators including severe, death and LOS. Conclusion: This study observed that several non-traditional issues were associated with early cardiac injury in COVID-19 while many traditional cardiovascular risk factors were not. Besides elderly and male, hypertension was confirmed to be the most important risk factor.",

    "abstract": "Introduction. Since its identification, the COVID-19 infection has caused substantial mortality and morbidity worldwide, but sub-Saharan Africa seems to defy the predictions. We aimed to verify this hypothesis using strong statistical methods. Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional study comparing the projected and actual numbers as well as population proportions of COVID-19 cases in the 46 sub-Saharan African countries on May 1st, May 29th (4 weeks later) and June 26th (8 weeks later). The source of the projected number of cases was a publication by scientists from the Center for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, whereas the actual number of cases was obtained from the WHO situation reports. We calculated the percentage difference between the projected and actual numbers of cases per country. Further, N-1 chi-square tests with Bonferroni correction were used to compare the projected and actual population proportion of COVID-19 cases, along with the 95% confidence interval of the difference between these population proportions. All statistical tests were 2-sided, with 0.05 used as threshold for statistical significance. Results. On May 1st, May 29th and June 26th, respectively 40 (86.95%), 45 (97.82%) and 41 (89.13%) of the sub-Saharan African countries reported a number of confirmed cases that was lower than the predicted number of 1000 cases for May 1st and 10000 for both May 29th and June 26th. At these dates, the population proportions of confirmed Covid-19 cases were significantly lower (p-value <0.05) than the projected proportions of cases. Across all these dates, South-Africa always exceeded the predicted number and population proportion of COVID-19 infections. Conclusion. Sub-Saharan African countries did defy the dire predictions of the COVID-19 burden. Preventive measures should be further enforced to preserve this positive outcome.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to clarify if the infection and death rate by COVID-19 differ among gender in the top 50 countries with the highest death rates. Also, we investigated if secondary variables such as HDI, number of hospital beds, average age, temperature, percentage of elderly, smoker and obesity are contributing to the variability observed among countries. Meta-analyses and meta-regressions approaches were applied to official public data reported by the Word Health Organization and governments until May, 2020. A random effect model was used for the meta-analysis and heterogeneity was calculated by I2 statistic. There was not significative difference between men and women to be infected by COVID-19 (P = 0.42), though a significative difference was observed for death rate (P < 0.0001). High heterogeneity was observed among countries. For both infection and death rates this variability was mainly explained by the HDI (42.3% and 54.2%), average age (40.9% and 40.3%) and temperature (30.1% and 39.3%). Man are dying more than women around the word by COVID-19. Countries with highest HDI present less difference between sexes. These results reinforce that public politics promoting social isolation, health care and general well-being of the population are key factors in combating COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1), also referred to as the host shutoff factor, is the first viral protein that is synthesized in SARS-CoV-2 infected human cells to suppress host innate immune functions1,2. By combining cryo-electron microscopy and biochemical experiments, we show that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 binds to the human 40S subunit in ribosomal complexes including the 43S pre-initiation complex. The protein inserts its C-terminal domain at the entrance to the mRNA channel where it interferes with mRNA binding. We observe potent translation inhibition in the presence of Nsp1 in lysates from human cells. Based on the high-resolution structure of the 40S-Nsp1 complex, we identify residues of Nsp1 crucial for mediating translation inhibition. We further show that the full-length 5\u2019 untranslated region of the genomic viral mRNA stimulates translation in vitro, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 combines inhibition of translation by Nsp1 with efficient translation of the viral mRNA to achieve expression of viral genes3.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "A small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibitors have demonstrated the novel modality for suppressing infectious diseases. Sixty-one siRNA molecules, predicted by the bioinformatics programs, were screened for the possibility of treating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using an in vitro plaque assay. Among six siRNA leads with the efficacy of reducing plaque number, the siRNA targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) showed a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced fever and virus titer in the Golden Syrian hamster and rhesus macaque. These results suggest the potential for RdRp targeting siRNA as a new treatment for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is the causative viral agent of COVID-19, the disease at the center of the current global pandemic. While knowledge of highly structured regions is integral for mechanistic insights into the viral infection cycle, very little is known about the location and folding stability of functional elements within the massive, ~30kb SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. In this study, we analyze the folding stability of this RNA genome relative to the structural landscape of other well-known viral RNAs. We present an in-silico pipeline to locate regions of high base pair content across this long genome and also identify well-defined RNA structures, a method that allows for direct comparisons of RNA structural complexity within the several domains in SARS-CoV-2 genome. We report that the SARS-CoV-2 genomic propensity to stable RNA folding is exceptional among RNA viruses, superseding even that of HCV, one of the most highly structured viral RNAs in nature. Furthermore, our analysis reveals varying levels of RNA structure across genomic functional regions, with accessory and structural ORFs containing the highest structural density in the viral genome. Finally, we take a step further to examine how individual RNA structures formed by these ORFs are affected by the differences in genomic and subgenomic contexts. The conclusions reported in this study provide a foundation for structure-function hypotheses in SARS-CoV-2 biology, and in turn, may guide the 3D structural characterization of potential RNA drug targets for COVID-19 therapeutics.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Despite no or limited pre-clinical evidence, repurposed drugs are massively evaluated in clinical trials to palliate the lack of antiviral molecules against SARS-CoV-2. Here we used a Syrian hamster model to assess the antiviral efficacy of favipiravir, understand its mechanism of action and determine its pharmacokinetics. When treatment was initiated before or simultaneously to infection, favipiravir had a strong dose effect, leading to dramatic reduction of infectious titers in lungs and clinical alleviation of the disease. Antiviral effect of favipiravir correlated with incorporation of a large number of mutations into viral genomes and decrease of viral infectivity. The antiviral efficacy observed in this study was achieved with plasma drug exposure comparable with those previously found during human clinical trials and was associated with weight losses in animals. Thereby, pharmacokinetic and tolerance studies are required to determine whether similar effects can be safely achieved in humans.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly become a global pandemic. In addition to the acute pulmonary symptoms of COVID-19 (the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection), pulmonary and distal coagulopathies have caused morbidity and mortality in many patients. Currently, the molecular pathogenesis underlying COVID-19 associated coagulopathies are unknown. While there are many theories for the cause of this pathology, including hyper inflammation and excess tissue damage, the cellular and molecular underpinnings are not yet clear. By analyzing transcriptomic data sets from experimental and clinical research teams, we determined that changes in the gene expression of genes important in the extrinsic coagulation cascade in the lung epithelium may be important triggers for COVID-19 coagulopathy. This regulation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade is not seen with influenza A virus (IAV)-infected NHBEs suggesting that the lung epithelial derived coagulopathies are specific to SARS-Cov-2 infection. This study is the first to identify potential lung epithelial cell derived factors contributing to COVID-19 associated coagulopathy.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=104 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/182972v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@93cfb7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2a23c9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@93623borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@161e25_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG AUTHOR SUMMARYO_ST_ABSWhy was this study done?C_ST_ABSO_LISevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly become a global pandemic.\nC_LIO_LIIn addition to the acute pulmonary symptoms of COVID-19 (the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection), pulmonary and distal coagulopathies have caused morbidity and mortality in many patients.\nC_LIO_LICurrently, the molecular pathogenesis underlying COVID-19 associated coagulopathies are unknown.

    "abstract": "The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emergence in 2003 introduced the first serious human coronavirus pathogen to an unprepared world. To control emerging viruses, existing successful anti(retro)viral therapies can inspire antiviral strategies, as conserved viral enzymes (eg., viral proteases and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases) represent targets of choice. Since 2003, much effort has been expended in the characterization of the SARS-CoV replication/transcription machinery. Until recently, a pure and highly active preparation of SARS-CoV recombinant RNA synthesis machinery was not available, impeding target-based high throughput screening of drug candidates against this viral family. The current Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic revealed a new pathogen whose RNA synthesis machinery is highly (>96% aa identity) homologous to SARS-CoV. This phylogenetic relatedness highlights the potential use of conserved replication enzymes to discover inhibitors against this significant pathogen, which in turn, contributes to scientific preparedness against emerging viruses. Here, we report the use of a purified and highly active SARS-CoV replication/transcription complex (RTC) to set-up a high-throughput screening of Coronavirus RNA synthesis inhibitors. The screening of a small (1,520 compounds) chemical library of FDA-approved drugs demonstrates the robustness of our assay and will allow to speed-up drug repositioning or novel drug discovery against the SARS-CoV-2.\n\nPrinciple of SARS-CoV RNA synthesis detection by a fluorescence-based high throughput screening assay\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=81 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/192005v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e8122dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18557org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d95362org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f15222_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Highlights- A new SARS-CoV non radioactive RNA polymerase assay is described\n- The robotized assay is suitable to identify RdRp inhibitors based on HTS",

    "abstract": "Background: Mortality in care homes has had a prominent focus during the COVID-19 outbreak. Multiple and interconnected challenges face the care home sector in the prevention and management of outbreaks of COVID-19, including adequate supply of personal protective equipment, staff shortages, and insufficient or lack of timely COVID-19 testing. Care homes are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases. Aim: To analyse the mortality of older care home residents in Wales during COVID-19 lockdown and compare this across the population of Wales and the previous 4-years. Study Design and Setting: We used anonymised Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and administrative data from the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank to create a cross-sectional cohort study. We anonymously linked data for Welsh residents to mortality data up to the 14th June 2020. Methods: We calculated survival curves and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of mortality. We adjusted hazard ratios for age, gender, social economic status and prior health conditions. Results: Survival curves show an increased proportion of deaths between 23rd March and 14th June 2020 in care homes for older people, with an adjusted HR of 1.72 (1.55, 1.90) compared to 2016. Compared to the general population in 2016-2019, adjusted care home mortality HRs for older adults rose from 2.15 (2.11,2.20) in 2016-2019 to 2.94 (2.81,3.08) in 2020. Conclusions: The survival curves and increased HRs show a significantly increased risk of death in the 2020 study periods.",

We identified 220 host DNA sequence variants acting in cis (MAF 0.01-49.9%) and explaining 0.3-70.9% of the variance of 97 of these proteins, including 45 with no previously known protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) and 38 encoding current drug targets. Systematic characterization of pQTLs across the phenome identified protein-drug-disease links, evidence that putative viral interaction partners such as MARK3 affect immune response, and establish the first link between a recently reported variant for respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients at the ABO locus and hypercoagulation, i.e. maladaptive host response. Our results accelerate the evaluation and prioritization of new drug development programmes and repurposing of trials to prevent, treat or reduce adverse outcomes. Rapid sharing and dynamic and detailed interrogation of results is facilitated through an interactive webserver (https://omicscience.org/apps/covidpgwas/).",

    "abstract": "The lockdown policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK has a potentially important impact on provision of mental healthcare with uncertain consequences over the 12 months ahead. Past activity may provide a means to predict future demand. Taking advantage of the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource at the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in south London), we carried out a range of descriptive analyses to inform the Trust on patient groups who might be most likely to require inpatient and home treatment team (HTT) crisis care. We considered the 12 months following UK COVID-19 lockdown policy on 16th March, drawing on comparable findings from previous years, and quantified levels of change in service delivery to those most likely to receive crisis care. For 12-month crisis days from 16th March in 2015-19, we found that most (over 80%) were accounted for by inpatient care (rather than HTT), most (around 75%) were used by patients who were current or recent Trust patients at the commencement of follow-up, and highest numbers were used by patients with a previously recorded schizophreniform disorder diagnosis. For current/recent patients on 16th March there had been substantial reductions in use of inpatient care in the following 31 days in 2020, more than previous years; changes in total non-inpatient contact numbers did not differ in 2020 compared to previous years, although there had been a marked switch from face-to-face to virtual contacts.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has propagated a global pandemic with significant health, economic and social costs. Emerging emergence has suggested that several factors may be associated with increased risk from severe outcomes or death from COVID-19. Clinical risk prediction tools have significant potential to generate individualised assessment of risk and may be useful for population stratification and other use cases. Methods and analysis: We will use a prospective open cohort study of routinely collected data from 1205 general practices in England in the QResearch database. The primary outcome is COVID-19 mortality (in or out-of-hospital) defined as confirmed or suspected COVID-19 mentioned on the death certificate, or death occurring in a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection between 24th January and 30th April 2020. Our primary outcome in adults is COVID-19 mortality (including out of hospital and in hospital deaths). We will also examine COVID-19 hospitalisation in children. Time-to-event models will be developed in the training data to derive separate risk equations in adults (19-100 years) for males and females for evaluation of risk of each outcome within the 3-month follow-up period (24th January to 30th April 2020), accounting for competing risks. Predictors considered will include age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, smoking status, alcohol intake, body mass index, pre-existing medical co-morbidities, and concurrent medication. Measures of performance (prediction errors, calibration and discrimination) will be determined in the test data for men and women separately and by ten-year age group. For children, descriptive statistics will be undertaken if there are currently too few serious events to allow development of a risk model. The final model will be externally evaluated in (a) geographically separate practices and (b) other relevant datasets as they become available. Ethics and dissemination: The project has ethical approval and the results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) and was met with lockdown policies to curb the spread of the disease. This meant that 890 million students in 114 countries would be affected by the closure of their educational institutes, affecting their mental health. Mental health disorders are suggested to have a well-correlated link to suicide which is the third most leading cause of death worldwide amongst children aged 15-19 years. According to WHO, 'health is a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease'. Hence the isolation brought about by SARS-CoV-2 is postulated to cause anxiety, fear, and depression amongst the pediatric population, due to the loss of socialization and separation from friends. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we highlight the major mental health issues in children aged 2-18 years, along with their causes, effects, and potential solutions to tackle these problems.",

The aim of this study was to examine the readability of international and national health organizations on Covid-19 information in their websites employing a previously validated tool. Methods: A purposive sample of publicly accessible governmental and popular international health organization websites was selected. The readability of the websites Covid-19 public health information was estimated using the previously validated SMOG readability formula, which determined reading level by correlating the number of polysyllabic words. Results: Of the 10 websites included in the analysis, none had Covid-19 public health information at the USDHHS recommended reading level. The material ranged in reading level at undergraduate level or above. Discussion: The findings indicate that the online Covid-19 materials need to be modified in order to reach recommended reading levels. This study can be of practical use to policy makers and public health government officials when designing, modifying, and evaluating Covid-19 materials. We recommend using simple, non-polysyllable words to ensure that Covid-19 public health information materials are written at the recommended reading levels.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between meteorological factors such as temperature and humidity with COVID-19 incidence is still unclear after 6 months of the beginning of the pandemic. Some literature confirms the association of temperature with disease transmission while some oppose the same. This work intends to determine whether there is a causal association between temperature, humidity and Covid-19 cases. Three different causal models were used to capture stochastic, chaotic and symbolic natured time-series data and to provide a robust & unbiased analysis by constructing networks of causal relationships between the variables. Granger-Causality method, Transfer Entropy method & Convergent Cross-Mapping (CCM) was done on data from regions with different temperatures and cases greater than 50,000 as of 13th May 2020. From the Granger-Causality test we found that in only Canada, the United Kingdom, temperature and daily new infections are causally linked. The same results were obtained from Convergent Cross Mapping for India. Again using Granger-Causality test, we found that in Russia only, relative humidity is causally linked to daily new cases. Thus, a Generalized Additive Model with a smoothing spline function was fitted for these countries to understand the directionality. Using the combined results of the said models, we were able to conclude that there is no evidence of a causal association between temperature, humidity and Covid-19 cases.",

We provide an extensive evaluation of this fully automated assay on the Cobas e801/e602 immunoassay analysers. Methods: We assessed the linearity, precision, and throughput of the Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay. Sensitivity was calculated from 349 SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive samples; specificity was determined from 714 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-naive samples. We examined cross-reactivity against other antibody positive samples (syphilis, RF, ANA, ds-DNA, influenza, dengue, HBV, HCV) and the anti-SARS-CoV-2 kinetics. Results: The assay cut-off index (COI) was linear up to 90.7. The inter-assay precision was 2.9% for a negative control (COI=0.1) and 5.1% for a positive control (COI=3.0). Assay time is 18min and results are available 1 minute later; throughput for 300 samples was 76 minutes. No cross-reactivity was observed with other antibody positive samples; specificity was 100%. The assay has a sensitivity of 97.1% 14 days after PCR positivity (POS) and 100% at [&ge;]21 days POS; 48.2% of cases had anti-SARS-CoV-2 within 6 days POS. In 11 subjects in whom serum was available prior to a positive antibody signal (COI [&ge;]1.0) the interval between the last negative and first positive COI (time to sero-conversion) on average is 3 days (range 1-6 days) and 4 more days (range 1-7) for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 to plateau. Conclusion: The Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay shows excellent performance with minimal cross-reactivity from other viral and confounding antibodies. Antibody development and sero-conversion appears quite early.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosis and surveillance of emerging pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 depend on nucleic acid isolation from clinical and environmental samples. Under normal circumstances, samples would be processed using commercial proprietary reagents in Biosafety 2 (BSL-2) or higher facilities. A pandemic at the scale of COVID-19 has caused a global shortage of proprietary reagents and BSL-2 laboratories to safely perform testing. Therefore, alternative solutions are urgently needed to address these challenges. We developed an open-source method called Magnetic- nanoparticle-Aided Viral RNA Isolation of Contagious Samples (MAVRICS) that is built upon reagents that are either readily available or can be synthesized in any molecular biology laboratory with basic equipment. Unlike conventional methods, MAVRICS works directly in samples inactivated in acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform (e.g., TRIzol), thus allowing infectious samples to be handled safely without biocontainment facilities. Using 36 COVID-19 patient samples, 2 wastewater samples and 1 human pathogens control sample, we showed that MAVRICS rivals commercial kits in validated diagnostic tests of SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus. MAVRICS is scalable and thus could become an enabling technology for widespread community testing and wastewater monitoring in the current and future pandemics.",

    "abstract": "Background: Several immunochromatographic serological test kits have been developed to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) specific antibodies, but their relative performance and potential clinical utility is unclear. Methods: Three commercially available serological test kits were evaluated using 99 serum samples collected from 29 patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Results: The IgM antibody-positive rates of the three serological test kits for samples taken at the early stage of the disease (0-6 days after onset) were 19.0%, 23.8%, and 19.0%, respectively. The IgM antibody-positive rates over the entire period were 21.2%, 60.6%, and 15.2%, respectively. The IgG antibody-positive rates for samples taken after 13 days of onset were 100.0%, 97.6%, and 97.6%, respectively. Conclusion: There were large differences among the results of the three test kits. Only few cases showed positive results for IgM in the early stage of disease and the IgM antibody-positive rates over the entire period were low, suggesting that the kits used in this study were unsuitable for diagnosis of COVID-19. The IgG antibody was positive in almost all samples after 13 days of onset, suggesting that it may be useful for determining infections in the recent past.",

    "abstract": "Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the association between obesity and composite poor outcome in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search from PubMed and Embase database. We included all original research articles in COVID-19 adult patients and obesity based on classification of Body Mass Index (BMI) and composite poor outcome which consist of mortality, morbidity, admission of Intensive Care Unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), and severe COVID-19. Results: Nine studies were included in meta-analysis with 6 studies presented BMI as continuous outcome and 3 studies presented BMI as dichotomous outcome (obese and non-obese). Most studies were conducted in China (55.5%) with remaining studies from French, Germany, and United States (US). COVID-19 patients with composite poor outcome had higher BMI with mean difference 0.55 kg/m2 (95% CI 0.07-1.03, P=0.02). BMI [&ge;]30 (obese) was associated with composite poor outcome with odds ratio 1.89 (95% CI 1.06-3.34, P=0.03). Multivariate meta-regression analysis by including three moderators: age, hypertension, and Diabetes Mellitus type 2 (DM type 2) showed the association between obesity and composite poor outcome was affected by age with regression coefficient =-0.06 and P=0.02. Subgroup analysis was not performed due to the limited number of studies for several outcomes. Conclusion: Obesity is a risk factor of composite poor outcome of COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 patients with composite poor outcome have higher BMI. BMI is an important routine procedure that should be assessed in the management of COVID-19 patients and special attention should be given to patients with obesity.

    "abstract": "Background: There are significant gaps in our understanding of the mortality effects of COVID-19 due to evolving diagnosis criteria, shortages of testing supplies, and challenges faced by physicians in treating patients in crisis environments. Accurate information on the number of deaths caused by COVID-19 is vital for policy makers and health care providers. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of weekly data for Ohio. To estimate expected mortality in 2020 we employed data from 2010 through 2019, adjusted for secular trends and seasonality. We estimated excess mortality as the number of observed deaths less the number of expected deaths. We conducted the analysis for the entire population and by age, gender, and county. Results: We estimated 2,088 (95% CI 1,119-3,119) excess deaths due to natural causes in Ohio from March 15, 2020 through June 6, 2020. While the largest number excess of deaths was observed in the 80+ age group, our estimate of 366 (95% CI 110-655) excess deaths for those between 20 and 49 years of age substantially exceeds the reported number of COVID-19 deaths of 66. Conclusions: Our methodology addressed some of the challenges of estimating the number of deaths caused by COVID-19. Our finding of excess deaths being considerably greater than the reported number of COVID-19 deaths for those aged 20 to 49 years old suggests that current tracking methods may not capture a significant number of COVID-19 deaths for this group. Further, increases in the infection rates for this cohort may have a greater mortality impact than anticipated.",

    "abstract": "Background: Ribavirin (RBV) is been used for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This drug is associated with a wide range of side effects, mainly anemia, so its use in patients with potential respiratory affectation could not be appropriate. The evidences of adverse events associated with RBV-use has mainly been derived in the context of hepatitis C (HCV) treatment, however the possible use of RBV in CoVID-19 patients could be limited to 14 days. Methods: Longitudinal study including HIV/HCV coinfected patients. We evaluate the hemoglobin dynamics and reductions as well as evaluate the development rate of anemia during the first 2 weeks of therapy in HCV infected patients. Results: 189 patients were included in the study. The median hemoglobin levels were 14.6 g/dL (IQR: 13.2-15.6 g/dL) and 13.5 g/dL (IQR: 12.3-14.5 g/dL) at weeks 1 and 2 of therapy, respectively. A cumulative number of 27 (14.2%) patients developed anemia (23 grade 1 [12.1%] and 4 grade 2 [2.1%]). We identify a baseline hemoglobin levels of 14 g/dL as the better cut-off to identify those patients with a high chance to develop anemia. Of the 132 patients with baseline hemoglobin level >14 g/dL, 8 developed anemia (6.1%) compared with 19 of 57 (33.3%) with hemoglobin levels lower than 14 g/dL (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our study shows valuable information about the early hemoglobin kinetic timing in patients on RBV-therapy, that could be useful to tailor CoVID-19 treatment if RBV use is considered.",

    "abstract": "Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an international emergency that has been addressed in many countries by changes in and restrictions on behaviour. These are often collectively labelled social distancing and lockdown. On the 23rd June 2020, Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom announced substantial easings of restrictions. This paper examines some of the data he presented. Methods: Generalised additive models, with negative binomial errors and cyclic term representing day-of-week effects, were fitted to data on the daily numbers of new confirmed cases of COVID-19. Exponential rates for the epidemic were estimated for different periods, and then used to calculate R, the reproduction number, for the disease in different periods. Results: After an initial stabilisation, the lockdown reduced R to around 0.81 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.82). This value increased to around 0.94 (95% CI 0.89, 0.996) for the fortnight from the 9th June 2020. Conclusions: Official UK data, presented as the easing of the lockdown was announced, shows that R was already more than half way back to 1 at that point. That suggests there was little scope for the announced changes to be implemented without restarting the spread of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Italy was the first Western country to be seriously affected by COVID-19, and the first to implement drastic measures, which have successfully curtailed the epidemic. To understand which containment measures altered disease dynamics, we estimate change points in COVID-19 dynamics from official Italian data. We find excellent correlation between nationwide lockdown and the epidemic peak in late March 2020. Surprisingly, we find a change point in mid April, which does not correspond to national measures, but may be explained by regional interventions. Change points in regional COVID-19 dynamics correlate well with local distribution of free face masks and regional orders requiring their mandatory use. Regions with no specific interventions showed no change point during April. We speculate that widespread use of face masks and other protective means has contributed substantially to keeping the number of new Italian COVID-19 cases under control in spite of society turning towards a new normality.",

    "abstract": "Background: Non-pharmacological interventions were introduced based on modelling studies which suggested that the English National Health Service (NHS) would be overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we describe the pattern of bed occupancy across England during the first wave of the pandemic, January 31st to June 5th 2020. Methods: Bed availability and occupancy data was extracted from daily reports submitted by all English secondary care providers, between 27-Mar and 5-June. Two thresholds (85% as per Royal College of Emergency Medicine and 92% as per NHS Improvement) were applied as thresholds for safe occupancy. Findings: At peak availability, there were 2711 additional beds compatible with mechanical ventilation across England, reflecting a 53% increase in capacity, and occupancy never exceeded 62%. A consequence of the repurposing of beds meant that at the trough, there were 8.7% (8,508) fewer general and acute (G&A) beds across England, but occupancy never exceeded 72%. The closest to (surge) capacity that any trust in England reached was 99.8% for general and acute beds. For beds compatible with mechanical ventilation there were 326 trust-days (3.7%) spent above 85% of surge capacity, and 154 trust-days (1.8%) spent above 92%. 23 trusts spent a cumulative 81 days at 100% saturation of their surge ventilator bed capacity (median number of days per trust = 1 [range: 1 to 17]). However, only 3 STPs (aggregates of geographically co-located trusts) reached 100% saturation of their mechanical ventilation beds. Interpretation: Throughout the first wave of the pandemic, an adequate supply of all bed-types existed at a national level. Due to an unequal distribution of bed utilization, many trusts spent a significant period operating above safe occupancy thresholds, despite substantial capacity in geographically co-located trusts; a key operational issue to address in preparing for a potential second wave.

    "abstract": "Background: As countries begin to ease the lockdown measures instituted to control the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a risk of a resurgence of the pandemic, and early reports of this are already emerging from some countries. Unlike many other countries, the UK started easing lockdown in England when levels of community transmission were still high, and this could have a major impact on case numbers and deaths. However thus far, the likely impacts of easing restrictions at this point in the pandemic have not been quantified. Using a Bayesian model, we assessed the potential impacts of successive lockdown easing measures in England, focussing on scenarios where the reproductive number (R) remains <1 in line with the UK governments stated aim. Methods: We developed a Bayesian model to infer incident cases and R in England, from incident death data from the Office of National Statistics. We then used this to forecast excess cases and deaths in multiple plausible scenarios in which R increases at one or more time points, compared to a baseline scenario where R remains unchanged by the easing of lockdown. Findings: The model inferred an R of 0.752 on the 13th May when England first started easing lockdown. In the most conservative scenario where R increases to 0.80 as lockdown was eased further on 1st June and then remained constant, the model predicts an excess 257 (95% 108-492) deaths and 26,447 (95% CI 11,105-50,549) cumulative cases over 90 days. In the scenario with maximal increases in R (but staying <1) with successive easing of lockdown, the model predicts 3,174 (95% 1,334-6,060) excess cumulative deaths and 421,310 (95% 177,012-804,811) excess cases. Results: When levels of transmission are high, even small changes in R with easing of lockdown can have significant impacts on expected cases and deaths, even if R remains <1. This will have a major impact on population health, tracing systems and health care services in England. Following an elimination strategy rather than one of maintenance of R below 1 would substantially mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic within England. This study provides urgently needed information for developing public health policy for the next stages of the pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Background: Obesity is a modifiable risk factor for coronavirus(COVID-19)-related mortality. We estimated excess mortality in obesity, both 'direct', through infection, and 'indirect', through changes in healthcare, and also due to potential increasing obesity during lockdown. Methods: In population-based electronic health records for 1 958 638 individuals in England, we estimated 1-year mortality risk('direct' and 'indirect' effects) for obese individuals, incorporating: (i)pre-COVID-19 risk by age, sex and comorbidities, (ii)population infection rate, and (iii)relative impact on mortality(relative risk, RR: 1.2, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0). Using causal inference models, we estimated impact of change in body-mass index(BMI) and physical activity during 3-month lockdown on 1-year incidence for high-risk conditions(cardiovascular diseases, CVD; diabetes; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD and chronic kidney disease, CKD), accounting for confounders. Findings: For severely obese individuals (3.5% at baseline), at 10% population infection rate, we estimated direct impact of 240 and 479 excess deaths in England at RR 1.5 and 2.0 respectively, and indirect effect of 383 to 767 excess deaths, assuming 40% and 80% will be affected at RR=1.2. Due to BMI change during the lockdown, we estimated that 97 755 (5.4%: normal weight to overweight, 5.0%: overweight to obese and 1.3%: obese to severely obese) to 434 104 individuals (15%: normal weight to overweight, 15%: overweight to obese and 6%: obese to severely obese) individuals would be at higher risk for COVID-19 over one year. Interpretation: Prevention of obesity and physical activity are at least as important as physical isolation of severely obese individuals during the pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Background: Early descriptions of the coronavirus outbreak showed a lower prevalence of asthma and COPD than was expected for people diagnosed with COVID-19, leading to speculation that inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) may protect against infection with SARS-CoV-2, and development of serious sequelae. We evaluated the association between ICS and COVID-19 related death using linked electronic health records in the UK. Methods: We conducted cohort studies on two groups of people (COPD and asthma) using the OpenSAFELY platform to analyse data from primary care practices linked to national death registrations. People receiving an ICS were compared to those receiving alternative respiratory medications. Our primary outcome was COVID-19 related death. Findings: We identified 148,588 people with COPD and 817,973 people with asthma receiving relevant respiratory medications in the four months prior to 01 March 2020. People with COPD receiving ICS were at a greater risk of COVID-19 related death compared to those receiving a long-acting beta agonist (LABA) and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) (adjusted HR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.08 - 1.75). People with asthma receiving high dose ICS were at an increased risk of death compared to those receiving a short-acting beta agonist (SABA) only (adjusted HR = 1.52, 95%CI = 1.08 - 2.14); the adjusted HR for those receiving low-medium dose ICS was 1.10 (95% CI = 0.82 - 1.49). Quantitative bias analyses indicated that an unmeasured confounder of only moderate strength of association with exposure and outcome could explain the observed associations in both populations. Interpretation: These results do not support a major role of ICS in protecting against COVID-19 related deaths. Observed increased risks of COVID-19 related death among people with COPD and asthma receiving ICS can be plausibly explained by unmeasured confounding due to disease severity.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 virus, the pathogen that causes Covid-19 disease, emerged in Wuhan region in China in 2019, infected more than 4M people and is responsible for death of at least 300K patients globally as of May 2020. Identification of the cellular response mechanisms to viral infection by SARS-CoV-2 may shed light on progress of the disease, indicate potential drug targets, and make design of new test methods possible.\n\nIn this study, we analysed transcriptomic response of normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) to SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared the response to H1N1 infection. Comparison of transcriptome of NHBE cells 24 hours after mock-infection and SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrated that most genes that respond to infection were upregulated (320 genes) rather than being downregulated (115 genes).While upregulated genes were enriched in signalling pathways related to virus response, downregulated genes are related to kidney development. We mapped the upregulated genes on KEGG pathways to identify the mechanisms that mediate the response. We identified canonical NF{kappa}B, TNF and IL-17 pathways to be significantly upregulated and to converge to NF{kappa}B pathway via positive feedback loops. Although virus entry protein ACE2 has low expression in NHBE cells, pathogen response pathways are strongly activated within 24 hours of infection. Our results also indicate that immune response system is activated at the early stage of the infection and orchestrated by a crosstalk of signalling pathways. Finally, we compared transcriptomic SARS-CoV-2 response to H1N1 response in NHBE cells to elucidate the virus specificity of the response and virus specific extracellular proteins expressed by NHBE cells.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the pandemic of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome resulting in infections and death of millions worldwide with maximum cases and mortality in USA. The current study focuses on understanding the population specific variations attributing its high rate of infections in specific geographical regions which may help in developing appropriate treatment strategies for COVID-19 pandemic. Rigorous phylogenetic network analysis of 245 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes inferred five central clades named a (ancestral), b, c, d and e (subtype e1 & e2) showing both divergent and linear evolution types. The clade d & e2 were found exclusively comprising of USA strains with highest known mutations. Clades were distinguished by ten co-mutational combinations in proteins; Nsp3, ORF8, Nsp13, S, Nsp12, Nsp2 and Nsp6 generated by Amino Acid Variations (AAV). Our analysis revealed that only 67.46 % of SNP mutations were carried by amino acid at phenotypic level. T1103P mutation in Nsp3 was predicted to increase the protein stability in 238 strains except six strains which were marked as ancestral type; whereas com (P5731L & Y5768C) in Nsp13 were found in 64 genomes of USA highlighting its 100% co-occurrence. Docking study highlighted mutation (D7611G) caused reduction in binding of Spike proteins with ACE2, but it also showed better interaction with TMPRSS2 receptor which may contribute to its high transmissibility in USA strains. In addition, we found host proteins, MYO5A, MYO5B & MYO5C had maximum interaction with viral hub proteins (Nucleocapsid, Spike & Membrane). Thus, blocking the internalization pathway by inhibiting MYO-5 proteins which could be an effective target for COVID-19 treatment. The functional annotations of the Host-Pathogen Interaction (HPI) network were found to be highly associated with hypoxia and thrombotic conditions confirming the vulnerability and severity of infection in the patients. We also considered the presence of CpG islands in Nsp1 and N proteins which may confers the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to enter and trigger methyltransferase activity inside host cell.",

    "abstract": "Aim: To identify Australian primary healthcare nurses immediate support needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Background: COVID-19 has had widespread implications for primary healthcare nurses. Supporting these nurses' capacity to deliver quality care ensures that ongoing health needs can be met. Methods: Primary healthcare nurses were recruited to an online survey via social media and professional organisations in April 2020. Results: Six-hundred and thirty-seven responses were included in analysis. Participants provided 1213 statements about perceived supports required to provide quality clinical care. From these, seven key categories emerged, namely; personal protective equipment, communication, funding, industrial issues, self-care, workplace factors and valuing nurses. Conclusion: A number of key issues relating to personal health and safety, care quality, and job security need to be addressed to support primary healthcare nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Addressing these support issues can assist in retaining nurses and optimising the role of primary healthcare nurses during a pandemic. Implications for nursing management: Responding to the needs of primary healthcare nurses has the potential to facilitate their role in providing community-based healthcare. This knowledge can guide the provision of support for primary healthcare nurses during the current pandemic, as well as informing planning for future health crises.",

    "abstract": "We previously reported that the ApoE e4e4 genotype was associated with COVID-19 test positivity (OR=2.31, 95% CI: 1.65 to 3.24, p=1.19x10-6) in the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort, during the epidemic peak in England, from March 16 to April 26, 2020. With more COVID-19 test results (March 16 to May 31, 2020) and mortality data (to April 26, 2020) linked to UKB, we re-evaluated the ApoE e4 allele association with COVID-19 test positivity, and with all-cause mortality following test-confirmed COVID-19. Logistic regression models compared ApoE e4e4 participants (or e3e4s) to e3e3s with adjustment for sex; age on April 26th or age at death; baseline UKB assessment center in England (accounting for geographical differences in viral exposures); genotyping array type; and the top five genetic principal components (accounting for possible population admixture). ApoE e4e4 genotype was associated with increased risks of test positivity (OR=2.24, 95% CI: 1.72 to 2.93, p=3.24x10-9) and of mortality with test-confirmed COVID-19 (OR=4.29, 95% CI: 2.38 to 7.72, p=1.22x10-6), compared to e3e3s. Independent replications are needed to confirm our findings and mechanistic work is needed to understand how ApoE e4e4 results in the marked increase in vulnerability, especially for COVID-19 mortality. These findings also demonstrate that risks for COVID-19 mortality are not simply related to advanced chronological age or the comorbidities commonly seen in aging.",

    "abstract": "Medical practitioners record the condition status of a patient through qualitative and quantitative observations. The measurement of vital signs and molecular parameters in the clinics gives a complementary description of abnormal phenotypes associated with the progression of a disease. The Clinical Measurement Ontology (CMO) is used to standardize annotations of these measurable traits. However, researchers have no way to describe how these quantitative traits relate to phenotype concepts in a machine-readable manner. Using the WHO clinical case report form standard for the COVID-19 pandemic, we modeled quantitative traits and developed OWL axioms to formally relate clinical measurement terms with anatomical, biomolecular entities and phenotypes annotated with the Uber-anatomy ontology (Uberon), Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) and the Phenotype and Trait Ontology (PATO) biomedical ontologies. The formal description of these relations allows interoperability between clinical and biological descriptions, and facilitates automated reasoning for analysis of patterns over quantitative and qualitative biomedical observations.",

    "abstract": "Modifiable risk factors affect SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality raising the possibility that lifestyle modification could play a role. This has not been studied at a global level. We analysed publicly available data from countries reporting COVID-19 cases and deaths. Associations of modifiable risk factors with total cases and excess deaths were determined with and without adjustment for confounders. 4,670,832 cases and 311,384 deaths were reported by 181 countries by 18th May 2020. Wealthier countries had the greatest caseload. Obesity was the primary modifiable risk factor for infection and greater age, male sex, physical inactivity and low salt consumption were associated with excess deaths. Obesity was less influential on mortality than physical inactivity. Globally, obesity confers vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection and physical inactivity likely explains the greater mortality in the obese. High salt consumption may induce reductions in tissue ACE2 expression and subsequently reduce mortality rates.",

    "abstract": "Background: There are limited data on knowledge and behaviors related to COVID-19, and on the adoption of preventive behaviors, in sub-Saharan countries. Methods: Between April 25th and May 23rd, we contacted 793 individuals aged 18 and older, who previously participated in studies conducted in the Karonga Health and Demographic Surveillance Site in Karonga District, Malawi. During an interview by mobile phone, we ascertained sources of information about COVID-19 and we evaluated knowledge of respondents about the transmission and course of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. We also asked them to evaluate their own risk of infection and severe illness. Finally, we inquired about the preventive measures they had adopted in response to the pandemic. We describe patterns of knowledge and behaviors among survey respondents, by area of residence (rural vs. urban). Results: We interviewed 630 respondents (79.5% response rate) which included 260 men and 370 women. Four hundred and eighty-nine respondents resided in rural areas (77.6%) and 141 resided in urban areas (22.4%). Only one respondent had never heard of COVID-19. Respondents reported on average 4 distinct sources of information about COVID-19. Misconceptions about the modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and about the course and severity of COVID-19, were common. For example, two thirds of respondents believed that everyone with COVID-19 would eventually become severely ill. Increased hand washing and avoiding crowds were the most reported strategies to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Use of face masks was more common among urban residents (22.5%) than among rural residents (5.0%). Conclusion: Despite widespread access to information about the COVID-19 pandemic, gaps in knowledge about COVID-19 persist in this population. The adoption of preventive strategies remains limited, possibly due to limited perceived risk of infection among a large fraction of the population.",

    "abstract": "The lockdown and social distancing policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK has a potentially important impact on provision of mental healthcare; however, there has been relatively little quantification of this. Taking advantage of the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource with 24-hourly updates of electronic mental health records data, this paper describes daily caseloads and contact numbers (face-to-face and virtual) for home treatment teams (HTTs) and working age adult community mental health teams (CMHTs) from 1st February to 15th May 2020 at the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM), a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in south London. In addition daily deaths are described for all current and previous SLaM service users over this period and the same dates in 2019. In summary, the CMHT sector showed relatively stable caseloads and total contact numbers, but a substantial shift from face-to-face to virtual contacts, while HTTs showed the same changeover but reductions in caseloads and total contacts (although potentially an activity rise again during May). Number of deaths for the two months between 16th March and 15th May were 2.4-fold higher in 2020 than 2019, with 958 excess deaths.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has potential to disrupt and burden the mental health care system, and to magnify inequalities experienced by mental health service users. Methods: We investigated staff reports regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in its early weeks on mental health care and mental health service users in the UK using a mixed methods online survey. Recruitment channels included professional associations and networks, charities and social media. Quantitative findings were reported with descriptive statistics, and content analysis conducted for qualitative data. Results: 2,180 staff from a range of sectors, professions and specialties participated. Immediate infection control concerns were highly salient for inpatient staff, new ways of working for community staff. Multiple rapid adaptations and innovations in response to the crisis were described, especially remote working. This was cautiously welcomed but found successful in only some clinical situations. Staff had specific concerns about many groups of service users, including people whose conditions are exacerbated by pandemic anxieties and social disruptions; people experiencing loneliness, domestic abuse and family conflict; those unable to understand and follow social distancing requirements; and those who cannot engage with remote care. Conclusion: This overview of staff concerns and experiences in the early COVID-19 pandemic suggests directions for further research and service development: we suggest that how to combine infection control and a therapeutic environment in hospital, and how to achieve effective and targeted tele-health implementation in the community, should be priorities. The limitations of our convenience sample must be noted.",

    "abstract": "Computerized Tomography (CT )has a prognostic role in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 due to it gives both fast and accurate results. This is very important to help decision making of clinicians for quick isolation and appropriate patient treatment. In this study, we combine methods such as segmentation, data augmentation and the generative adversarial network (GAN) to improve the effectiveness of learning models. We obtain the best performance with 99% accuracy for lung segmentation. Using the above improvements we get the highest rates in terms of accuracy (99.8%), precision (99.8%), recall (99.8%), f1-score (99.8%) and roc acu (99.9979%) with deep learning methods in this paper. Also we compare popular deep learning-based frameworks such as VGG16, VGG19, Xception, ResNet50, ResNet50V2, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, InceptionV3 and InceptionResNetV2 for automatic COVID-19 classification. The DenseNet169 amongst deep convolutional neural networks achieves the best performance with 99.8% accuracy. The second-best learner is InceptionResNetV2 with accuracy of 99.65\\%.

    "abstract": "Seroconversion appeared early after COVID-19 onset, and convalescent sera therapy benefit some critical patients. However, neutralizing antibody (nAb) in convalescents is largely unknown. We found that 97.01% (65/67) of COVID-19 convalescents maintained IgG antibodies with high binding and avidity to SARS-CoV-2 spike subunits S1 and S2, and 95.52% (64/67) had neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 pesudovirus, one month after discharge (median ID50, 2.75; IQR, 2.34-3.08). Some sera exhibited cross-neutralization against SARS-CoV (76.12%), MERS-CoV (17.91%), or both (10.45%). Interestingly, individuals recovered from severe disease (severe group) had nAbs with binding and neutralization titers higher than non-severe group. Severe group appeared a rapid increase of lymphocytes and a high proportion of circulating CXCR3+ Tfh cells. Interestingly, the later were spike-specific and positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 nAb titers. All subjects had no autoimmunity. Our findings provide novel insights into nAb responses in COVID-19 convalescents and facilitate treatment and vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "Background: Cardiovascular diseases(CVD) increase mortality risk from coronavirus infection(COVID-19), but there are concerns that the pandemic has affected supply and demand of acute cardiovascular care. We estimated excess mortality in specific CVDs, both direct, through infection, and indirect, through changes in healthcare. Methods: We used population-based electronic health records from 3,862,012 individuals in England to estimate pre- and post-COVID-19 mortality risk(direct effect) for people with incident and prevalent CVD. We incorporated: (i)pre-COVID-19 risk by age, sex and comorbidities, (ii)estimated population COVID-19 prevalence, and (iii)estimated relative impact of COVID-19 on mortality(relative risk, RR: 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0). For indirect effects, we analysed weekly mortality and emergency department data for England/Wales and monthly hospital data from England(n=2), China(n=5) and Italy(n=1) for CVD referral, diagnosis and treatment until 1 May 2020. Findings: CVD service activity decreased by 60-100% compared with pre-pandemic levels in eight hospitals across China, Italy and England during the pandemic. In China, activity remained below pre-COVID-19 levels for 2-3 months even after easing lockdown, and is still reduced in Italy and England. Mortality data suggest indirect effects on CVD will be delayed rather than contemporaneous(peak RR 1.4). For total CVD(incident and prevalent), at 10% population COVID-19 rate, we estimated direct impact of 31,205 and 62,410 excess deaths in England at RR 1.5 and 2.0 respectively, and indirect effect of 49932 to 99865 excess deaths. Interpretation: Supply and demand for CVD services have dramatically reduced across countries with potential for substantial, but avoidable, excess mortality during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: COVID-19, which emerged in December 2019, is the largest pandemic ever to occur. During the early phase, little was known about public awareness relating to Coronavirus disease. This study was designed to determine knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) among the Iranian public towards COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was carried out in Iran from 2 March to 8 April 2020 using a self-administered questionnaire on 1,480 people. COVID-19-related KAP questions were adapted from other internationally validated questionnaires specific to infectious diseases. Results: All participants were aware of COVID-19. When asked unprompted, 80% of respondents could correctly cite fever, difficulty breathing and cough as signs/symptoms of COVID-19. Most of our sample population knew that by staying at home and staying isolated (95.3%, 95 % CI: 94.2-96.3) as well as constant hand washing and using disinfectants (92.5%, 95 % CI: 91.1-93.8) could prevent COVID-19. However, there was also widespread misconceptions such as the belief that COVID-19 can be transmitted by wild animals (58%, 95 % CI: 55.5-60.5) and by air (48.3%, 95 % CI: 45.7-50.8). Unprompted, self-reported actions taken to avoid COVID-19 infection included hand washing with soap and water (95.4%, 95 % CI: 94.3-96.4), avoiding crowded places (93%, 95 % CI: 91.7-94.3), cleaning hands with other disinfectants (80.9 %, 95 % CI: 78.9- 82.9), and covering mouths and noses when coughing and sneezing (76.1 %, 95 % CI: 73.9-78.2). The internet and social media (94.5%, 95 % CI: 93.3-95.6) were the main Coronavirus information sources. However, the most trusted information sources on Coronavirus were health and medical professionals (79.3%, 95 % CI: 77.2-81.3). The majority of participants (77.0%, 95 % CI: 74.8-79.1) wanted more information about Coronavirus to be available. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that people's knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 at the time of its outbreak was of a high level. Therefore, health systems should use multiple ways, such as mass media, phone applications, electronic, print, and tele-education to increase KAP related to COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Measure the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, work-exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being among faculty and staff at a university and academic medical center during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and describe work-related and personal factors associated with mental health and well-being. Design: Observational cohort study conducted between April 17 and May 1, 2020 using a web-based questionnaire. Setting: Medical and main campuses of a university. Participants: All faculty, staff, and post-doctoral fellows. Exposures: Work factors including supervisor support and exposure to high-risk clinical settings; personal factors including demographics and family/home stressors. Main Outcomes and Measures: Stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being. Results: There were 5550 respondents (overall response rate of 34.3%). 38% of faculty and 14% of staff (n=915) were providing clinical care, while 57% of faculty and 77% of staff were working from home. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and work exhaustion were somewhat higher among clinicians than non-clinicians. Among all workers, anxiety, depression, and high work exhaustion were independently associated with community or clinical exposure to COVID-19 [Prevalence Ratios and 95% confidence intervals 1.37(1.09- 1.73), 1.28(1.03 - 1.59), and 1.24(1.13 - 1.36) respectively]. Poor family supportive behaviors by supervisors were also associated with these outcomes [1.40 (1.21 - 1.62), 1.69 (1.48 - 1.92), 1.54 (1.44 - 1.64)]. Age below 40 and a greater number of family/home stressors were also associated with poorer outcomes. Among the subset of clinicians, caring for patients with COVID-19 and work in high-risk clinical settings were additional risk factors. Conclusions and Implications: Our findings suggest that the pandemic has had negative effects on mental health and well-being among both clinical and non-clinical employees. Prevention of exposure to COVID-19 and increased supervisor support are modifiable risk factors that may protect mental health and well-being.",

    "abstract": "The manifestation of the COVID-19 varies from absence of symptoms to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. The epidemiological data indicate that infection and mortality rates are greater in European populations in comparison with eastern Asians. To test if epidemiological patterns may be partly determined by human genetic variation, we investigated, by exomic and databank analyses, the variability found in the TMPRSS2 gene in populations from different continents, since this gene is fundamental to virus access into human cells. The functional variants revealed low diversity. The analyses of the variation in the modifiers of gene expression indicate that the European populations may have much higher levels of pulmonary expression of the TMPRSS2 gene and would be more vulnerable to infection by SARS-CoV-2. By contrast, the pulmonary expression of the TMPRSS2 may be reduced in the populations from East Asia, which implies that they are less susceptible to the virus infection and, these genetic features might also favor their better outcomes. The presented data, if confirmed, indicates a potential genetic contribution of TMPRSS2 to individual susceptibility to viral infection, and might also influence COVID-19 outcome.",

    "abstract": "After the rapid spread with severe consequences in Europe and China, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is now manifesting itself in more vulnerable countries, including those in Latin America. In order to guide political decision-making via epidemiological criteria, it is crucial to assess the real impact of the epidemic. However, the use of large-scale population testing is unrealistic or not feasible in some countries. Based on a newly developed mathematical model, we estimated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Latin American countries. The results show that the virus spreads unevenly across countries. For example, Ecuador and Brazil are the most affected countries, with approximately 3% of the infected population. Currently, the number of new infections is increasing in all countries examined, with the exception of some Caribbean countries as Cuba. Moreover, in these countries, the peak of newly infected patients has not yet been reached.",

    "abstract": "Importance: New York City is a global epicenter for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with a significant number of individuals infected by the virus. Patients with multiple myeloma have a compromised immune system, due to both the disease and anti-myeloma therapies, and may therefore be particularly susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, there is limited information to guide clinical management. Objective: To assess risk factors and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with multiple myeloma. Design: Case-series. Setting: Five large academic centers in New York City. Participants: Patients with multiple myeloma and related plasma cell disorders who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 10th, 2020 and April 30th, 2020. Exposures: Clinical features and risk factors were analyzed in relation to severity of COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Descriptive statistics as well as logistic regression were used to estimate disease severity reflected in hospital admissions, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for mechanical ventilation, or death. Results: Of 100 multiple myeloma patients (male 58%; median age 68, range 41-91) diagnosed with COVID-19, 74 (74%) were admitted; of these 13 (18%) patients were placed on mechanical ventilation, and 18 patients (24%) expired. None of the studied risk factors were significantly associated (P>0.05) with adverse outcomes (ICU-admission, mechanical ventilation, or death): hypertension (N=56) odds ratio (OR) 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9-5.9); diabetes (N=18) OR 1.1 (95% CI 0.3-3.2); age >65 years (N=63) OR 2.0 (95% CI 0.8-5.3); high dose melphalan with autologous stem cell transplant <12 months (N=7) OR 1.2 (95% CI 0.2-7.4), IgG<650 mg/dL (N=42) OR=1.2 (95% CI 0.4-3.1). In the entire series of 127 patients with plasma cell disorders, hypertension was significantly associated with the combined end-point (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.5-8.1). Conclusions and Relevance: Although multiple myeloma patients have a compromised immune system due to both the disease and therapy; in this largest disease specific cohort to date of patients with multiple myeloma and COVID-19, compared to the general population, we found risk factors for adverse outcome to be shared and mortality rates to be within the higher range of officially reported mortality rates.",

    "abstract": "Presence of SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in wastewater sample has been documented in several countries. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is potentially effective for early warning of COVID-19 outbreak. The purpose of this study was to verify the detection limit of WBE for COVID-19. In total, 27 influent wastewater samples were collected from four wastewater treatment plants in Ishikawa and Toyama prefectures in Japan. During the study period, numbers of the confirmed COVID-19 cases in these prefectures increased from almost 0 to around 20 per 100,000 peoples. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the samples were identified by several PCR-based assays. Among the 27 samples, 7 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by at least one out of the three quantitative RT-PCR assays. These samples were also positive by RT-nested PCR assays. The detection frequency became higher when the number of total confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in 100,000 peoples became above 10 in each prefecture. However, SARS-CoV-2 could also be detected with a low frequency when the number was below 1.0. Considering that the number of the confirmed cases does not necessarily reflect the actual prevalence of the infection at the time point, data on the relationship between the number of infection cases and concentration in wastewater needs to be accumulated further.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background SARS-CoV-2 infection in Healthcare Workers (HCWs) is a public health concern during the pandemic. Little description has been made of their antibody response over time in the presence or absence detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA and of symptoms. We followed a cohort of patient-facing HCWs at an acute hospital in London to measure seroconversion and RNA detection at the peak of the pandemic in London. Methods We enrolled 200 front-line HCWs between 26 March and 8 April 2020 and collected twice-weekly self-administered nose and throat swabs and monthly blood samples. Baseline and regular symptom data were also collected. Swabs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase chain reaction, and serum for IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies to the virus spike protein by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry. Findings We enrolled HCWs with a variety of roles who worked in areas where COVID-19 patients were admitted and cared for. During the first month of observation, 42/200 (21%) HCWs were PCR positive in at least one nose and throat swab. Only 8/42 HCW (19%) who were PCR positive during the study period had symptoms that met the current case definition. Of 181 HCWs who provided enrollment and follow-up blood samples, 82/181 (45.3%) were seropositive; 36/181 (19.9%) seroconverted during the study and 46/181 (25.4%) were seropositive at both time points. In 33 HCWs who had positive serology at baseline but were PCR negative, 32 remained PCR negative throughout follow-up. One HCW had a PCR positive swab six days after enrollment, likely representing a waning infection. Interpretation The extremely high seropositivity and RNA detection in this cohort of front-line HCWs who worked during the peak of the pandemic brings policies to protect staff and patients in the hospital environment into acute focus. Our findings have implications for planning for the expected second wave and for future vaccination roll out campaigns in similar settings. The further evidence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection indicates that asymptomatic surveillance of HCWs is essential while our study sets the foundations to answer pertinent questions around the duration of protective immune response and the risk of re-infection.",

    "abstract": "We examined the link between BMI and risk of a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 and risk of COVID-19-related death among UK Biobank participants. Among 4855 participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 in hospital, 839 were positive and of these 189 died from COVID-19. Poisson models with penalised thin plate splines were run relating exposures of interest to test positivity and case-fatality, adjusting for confounding factors. BMI was associated strongly with positive test, and risk of death related to COVID-19. The gradient of risk in relation to BMI was steeper in those under 70, compared with those aged 70 years or older for COVID-19 related death (Pinteraction=0.03). BMI was more strongly related to test positivity (Pinteraction=0.010) and death (Pinteraction=0.002) in non-whites, compared with whites. These data add support for adiposity being more strongly linked to COVID-19-related deaths in younger people and non-white ethnicities. If future studies confirm causality, lifestyle interventions to improve adiposity status may be important to reduce the risk of COVID-19 in all, but perhaps particularly, non-white communities.",

    "abstract": "Current models for flu-like epidemics insufficiently explain multi-cycle seasonality. Meteorological factors alone, including the associated behavior, do not predict seasonality, given substantial climate differences between countries that are subject to flu-like epidemics or COVID-19. Pollen is documented to be allergenic, it plays a role in immuno-activation and defense against respiratory viruses, and seems to create a bio-aerosol that lowers the reproduction number of flu-like viruses. Therefore, we hypothesize that pollen may explain the seasonality of flu-like epidemics, including COVID-19, in combination with meteorological variables. We have tested the Pollen-Flu Seasonality Theory for 2016-2020 flu-like seasons, including COVID-19, in the Netherlands, with its 17.4 million inhabitants. We combined changes in flu-like incidence per 100K/Dutch residents (code: ILI) with pollen concentrations and meteorological data. Finally, a predictive model was tested using pollen and meteorological threshold values, inversely correlated to flu-like incidence. We found a highly significant inverse correlation of r(224)= -0.41 (p < 0.001) between pollen and changes in flu-like incidence, corrected for the incubation period. The correlation was stronger after taking into account the incubation time. We found that our predictive model has the highest inverse correlation with changes in flu-like incidence of r(222) = -0.48 (p < 0.001) when average thresholds of 610 total pollen grains/m3, 120 allergenic pollen grains/m3, and a solar radiation of 510 J/cm2 are passed. The passing of at least the pollen thresholds, preludes the beginning and end of flu-like seasons. Solar radiation is a co-inhibitor of flu-like incidence, while temperature makes no difference. However, higher relative humidity increases with flu-like incidence. We conclude that pollen is a predictor of the inverse seasonality of flu-like epidemics, including COVID-19, and that solar radiation is a co-inhibitor.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: To report the reduction in new neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) referrals during the COVID-19 pandemic and estimate the impact of delayed treatment on visual outcomes at one year. Design: Retrospective clinical audit and simulation model. Setting: Multiple UK NHS ophthalmology centres. Participants: Data on the reduction in new nAMD referrals was obtained from four NHS Trusts in England comparing April 2020 to April 2019. To estimate the potential impact on one-year visual outcomes, a stratified bootstrap simulation model was developed drawing on an electronic medical records dataset of 20,825 nAMD eyes from 27 NHS Trusts. Main outcome measures: Simulated mean visual acuity and proportions of eyes with vision [&le;]6/60, [&le;]6/24 and [&ge;]6/12 at one year under four hypothetical scenarios: no treatment delay, 3, 6 and 9-month treatment delays. Estimated additional number of eyes with vision [&le;]6/60 at one year nationally. Results: The number of nAMD referrals at four major eye treatment hospital groups based in England dropped on average by 72% (range 65 to 87%) in April 2020 compared to April 2019. Simulated one-year visual outcomes for 1000 nAMD eyes with a 3-month treatment delay suggested an increase in the proportion of eyes with vision [&le;]6/60 from 15.5% (13.2 to 17.9) to 23.3% (20.7 to25.9), and a decrease in the proportion of eyes with vision [&ge;]6/12 (driving vision) from 35.1% (32.1 to 38.1) to 26.4% (23.8 to29.2). Outcomes worsened incrementally with longer modelled delays. Assuming nAMD referrals are reduced to this level at the national level for only one month, these simulated results suggest an additional 186-365 eyes with vision [&le;]6/60 at one-year with even a short treatment delay. Conclusions: We report a large decrease in nAMD referrals during the first month of COVID-19 lockdown and provide an important public health message regarding the risk of delayed treatment. As a conservative estimate, a treatment delay of 3 months could lead to a >50% relative increase in the number of eyes with vision [&le;]6/60 and 25% relative decrease in the number of eyes with driving vision at one year.",

    "abstract": "One of the significant unanswered questions about COVID-19 epidemiology relates to the role of children in transmission. This study uses data on infections within households in order to estimate the susceptibility and infectivity of children compared to those of adults. The data were collected from households in the city of Bnei Brak, Israel, in which all household members were tested for COVID-19 using PCR (637 households, average household size of 5.3). In addition, serological tests were performed on a subset of the individuals in the study. Inspection of the PCR data shows that children are less likely to be tested positive compared to adults (25% of children positive over all households, 44% of adults positive over all households, excluding index cases), and the chance of being positive increases with age. Analysis of joint PCR/serological data shows that there is under-detection of infections in the PCR testing, which is more substantial in children. However, the differences in detection rates are not sufficient to account for the differences in PCR positive rates in the two age groups. To estimate relative transmission parameters, we employ a discrete stochastic model of the spread of infection within a household, allowing for susceptibility and infectivity parameters to differ among children and adults. The model is fitted to the household data using a simulated maximum likelihood approach. To adjust parameter estimates for under-detection of infections in the PCR results, we employ a multiple imputation procedure using estimates of under-detection in children and adults, based on the available serological data. We estimate that the susceptibility of children (under 20 years old) is 43% (95% CI: [31%, 55%]) of the susceptibility of adults. The infectivity of children was estimated to be 63% (95% CI: [37%, 88%]) relative to that of adults.\n\nAuthor SummaryOne of the significant unanswered questions about COVID-19 epidemiology relates to the role of children in transmission. In this study we estimate susceptibility and infectivity of children compared to those of adults using households data. The data were collected from households in the city of Bnei Brak, Israel, in which all household members were tested for COVID-19 using PCR. In addition, serological tests were performed on a subset of the individuals. Using a mathematical model to fit the data, we estimate that children are about half as susceptible to infection as adults, and are somewhat less prone to infect others compared to adults. In addition, using the serological data we find that under-detection of children, compared to that of adults, is more severe, given the PCR testing policy employed. Thus, both low susceptability and under-detection of children may explain the world-wide observation that the percentage of young children within confirmed COVID-19 cases is low compared to other age groups. However, the role of children in the spread of COVID-19 is also affected by different contact patterns and hygienic habits outside the household, so that more intense contact and mixing among children, for example in schools, could offset the effect of reduced susceptibility and infectivity.",

    "abstract": "A simplified model applied to COVID-19 cases detected and officially published by the italian government, seems to fit quite well the time evolution of the disease in Italy during the period feb-24th - may-19th 2020. The hypothesis behind the model is based on the fact that in the lockdown period the infection cannot be transmitted due to social isolation and, more generally, due to the strong protection measures in place during the observation period. In this case a compartment model is used and the interactions between the different compartments are simplified. The sample of cases detected is intended as a set of individuals susceptible to infection which, after being exposed and undergoing the infection, were isolated ('treated') in such a way they can no longer spread the infection. The values obtained are to be considered indicative as they depend not only on the quality of the data collected, but also on the qualitative approximation of the curves modeled to the data and on the number of available data. The same model has been applied both to the data relating to Italy and to some regions of Italy (Lombardia, Piemonte, Lazio, Campania, Calabria, Sicilia, Sardegna), generally finding a good response and indicatively interesting values.",

The model is tested using data from several countries, showing that a single function is able to describe very different shapes of the outbreak. The diverse behavior of the outbreak on those countries is presented and discussed.

    "abstract": "Background: High level stress is expected when crises starts affecting people's lives and communities which is witnessed in the past epidemics. Infectious diseases outbreaks like the ongoing COVID19 pandemic have negative impact on healthcare workers' (HCWs) mental health, which needs to be investigated. Therefore, we aimed to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 on frontline HCWs and their coping strategies. Methods: A web-based, cross-sectional study was conducted among HCWs of the Punjab province of Pakistan. The generalized anxiety scale (GAD-7), patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Brief-COPE were used to assess anxiety, depression and coping strategies of the respondents. Results: The mean age of respondents (N = 398) was 28.67 {+/-} 4.15 years, with majority of medical doctors (52%). The prevalence of anxiety and depression were 21.4% and 21.9%, respectively. There was no significant difference of anxiety and depression scores among doctors, nurses and pharmacists. Females had significantly higher anxiety (p = 0.003) and depression (p = 0.001) scores than males. Moreover, HCWs performing duties in COVID-19 ICU had significantly higher anxiety score than those from isolation wards (p = 0.020) and other departments (p = 0.014). Depression, not anxiety, score were higher among those who did not receive the infection prevention training. Most frequently adopted coping strategy was religious coping (5.98 {+/-} 1.73) followed by acceptance (5.59 {+/-} 1.55) and coping planning (4.91 {+/-} 1.85). Conclusion: A considerable proportion of HCWs are having generalized anxiety and depression during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings call for interventions to mitigate mental health risks in HCWs.",

    "abstract": "Background: In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 caused a global pandemic with a viral infection called COVID-19. The disease usually causes respiratory symptoms but in a small proportion of patients can lead to pneumonitis, Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome and death. Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (IMV) is considered a life-saving treatment for COVID-19 patients and a huge demand for IMV devices was reported globally. This review aims to provide insight on the initial IMV practices for COVID-19 patients in the initial phase of the pandemic. Methods: Electronic databases (Embase and MEDLINE) were searched for applicable articles using relevant keywords. The references of included articles were hand searched. Articles that reported the use of IMV in adult COVID-19 patients were included in the review. The NIH quality assessment tool for cohort and cross-sectional studies was used to appraise studies. Results: 106 abstracts were identified from the databases search, of which 16 were included. 4 studies were included in the meta-analysis. In total, 9988 patients were included across all studies. The overall cases of COVID-19 requiring IMV ranged from 2-75%. Increased age and pre-existing comorbidities increased the likelihood of IMV requirement. The reported mortality rate in patients receiving IMV ranged between 50-100%. On average, IMV was required and initiated between 10-10.5 days from symptoms onset. When invasively ventilated, COVID-19 patients required IMV for a median of 10-17 days across studies. Little information was provided on ventilatory protocols or management strategies and was inconclusive. Conclusion: In these initial reporting studies for the first month of the pandemic, patients receiving IMV were older and had more pre-existing co-morbidities than those who did not require IMV. The mortality rate was high in COVID-19 patients who received IMV. Studies are needed to evaluate protocols and modalities of IMV to improve outcomes and identify the populations most likely to benefit from IMV.",

    "abstract": "Covid-19 death has a different relationship with age than is the case for other severe respiratory pathogens. The Covid-19 death rate increases exponentially with age, and the main risk factors are age itself, as well as having underlying conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, severe chronic respiratory disease and cancer. Furthermore, the almost complete lack of deaths in children suggests that infection alone is not sufficient to cause death; rather, one must have gone through a number of changes, either as a result of undefined aspects of aging, or as a result of chronic disease. These characteristics of Covid-19 death are consistent with the multistep model of disease, a model which has primarily been used for cancer, and more recently for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We applied the multi-step model to data on Covid-19 case fatality rates (CFRs) from China, South Korea, Italy, Spain and Japan. In all countries we found that a plot of ln (CFR) against ln (age) was approximately linear with a slope of about 5. As a comparison, we also conducted similar analyses for selected other respiratory diseases. SARS showed a similar log-log age-pattern to that of Covid-19, albeit with a lower slope, whereas seasonal and pandemic influenza showed quite different age-patterns. Thus, death from Covid-19 and SARS appears to follow a distinct age-pattern, consistent with a multistep model of disease that in the case of Covid-19 is probably defined by comorbidities and age producing immune-related susceptibility. Identification of these steps would be potentially important for prevention and therapy for SARS-COV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "A key question in COVID-19 infection is why some previously healthy patients develop severe pulmonary failure and some ultimately die. Initial pulmonary failure does not exhibit classical features of ARDS; hypercoagulability is a common laboratory feature, and pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy has been reported post mortem1,2,3. Biomarkers cannot robustly identify such patients pre-emptively and no specific interventions exist to mitigate clinical deterioration. Mononuclear phagocytic cells are key immune cells and bind fibrinogen through the CD11b/CD18 dimer CR3, whose activated form can initiate microthrombus formation. Accordingly, we profiled circulating monocyte CD11b/CD18 cell surface density from COVID-19 infected adults who were (i) symptomatic but breathless, (ii) requiring ventilatory support, and (iii) recovering following ICU care for hypoxia.",

    "abstract": "Background: Cancer and multiple non-cancer conditions are considered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as high risk conditions in the COVID-19 emergency. Professional societies have recommended changes in cancer service provision to minimize COVID-19 risks to cancer patients and health care workers. However, we do not know the extent to which cancer patients, in whom multi-morbidity is common, may be at higher overall risk of mortality as a net result of multiple factors including COVID-19 infection, changes in health services, and socioeconomic factors. Methods: We report multi-center, weekly cancer diagnostic referrals and chemotherapy treatments until April 2020 in England and Northern Ireland. We analyzed population-based health records from 3,862,012 adults in England to estimate 1-year mortality in 24 cancer sites and 15 non-cancer comorbidity clusters (40 conditions) recognized by CDC as high-risk. We estimated overall (direct and indirect) effects of COVID-19 emergency on mortality under different Relative Impact of the Emergency (RIE) and different Proportions of the population Affected by the Emergency (PAE). We applied the same model to the US, using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program data. Results: Weekly data until April 2020 demonstrate significant falls in admissions for chemotherapy (45-66% reduction) and urgent referrals for early cancer diagnosis (70-89% reduction), compared to pre-emergency levels. Under conservative assumptions of the emergency affecting only people with newly diagnosed cancer (incident cases) at COVID-19 PAE of 40%, and an RIE of 1.5, the model estimated 6,270 excess deaths at 1 year in England and 33,890 excess deaths in the US. In England, the proportion of patients with incident cancer with [&ge;]1 comorbidity was 65.2%. The number of comorbidities was strongly associated with cancer mortality risk. Across a range of model assumptions, and across incident and prevalent cancer cases, 78% of excess deaths occur in cancer patients with [&ge;]1 comorbidity. Conclusion: We provide the first estimates of potential excess mortality among people with cancer and multimorbidity due to the COVID-19 emergency and demonstrate dramatic changes in cancer services. To better inform prioritization of cancer care and guide policy change, there is an urgent need for weekly data on cause-specific excess mortality, cancer diagnosis and treatment provision and better intelligence on the use of effective treatments for comorbidities.",

    "abstract": "The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has reached nearly every country in the world with extraordinary person-to-person transmission. The most likely original source of the virus was spillover from an animal reservoir and subsequent adaptation to humans sometime during the winter of 2019 in Wuhan Province, China. Because of its genetic similarity to SARS-CoV-1, it is likely that this novel virus has a similar host range and receptor specificity. Due to concern for human-pet transmission, we investigated the susceptibility of domestic cats and dogs to infection and potential for infected cats to transmit to naive cats. We report that cats are highly susceptible to subclinical infection, with a prolonged period of oral and nasal viral shedding that is not accompanied by clinical signs, and are capable of direct contact transmission to other cats. These studies confirm that cats are susceptible to productive SARS-CoV-2 infection, but are unlikely to develop clinical disease. Further, we document that cats develop a robust neutralizing antibody response that prevented re-infection to a second viral challenge. Conversely, we found that dogs do not shed virus following infection, but do mount an anti-viral neutralizing antibody response. There is currently no evidence that cats or dogs play a significant role in human exposure; however, reverse zoonosis is possible if infected owners expose their domestic pets during acute infection. Resistance to re-exposure holds promise that a vaccine strategy may protect cats, and by extension humans, to disease susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "In response to the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, the U.S. has largely delegated implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to local governments on the state and county level. This staggered implementation combined with the heterogeneity of the U.S. complicates quantification the effect of NPIs on the reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2. We describe a data-driven approach to quantify the effect of NPIs that relies on county-level similarities to specialize a Bayesian mechanistic model based on observed fatalities. Using this approach, we estimate change in reproductive rate, R_t, due to implementation of NPIs in 1,417 U.S. counties. We estimate that as of May 28th, 2020 1,177 out of the considered 1,417 U.S. counties have reduced the reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2 to below 1.0. The estimated effect of any individual NPI, however, is different across counties. Stay-at-home orders were estimated as the only effective NPI in metropolitan and urban counties, while advisory NPIs were estimated to be effective in more rural counties. The expected level of infection predicted by the model ranges from 0 to 28.7% and is far from herd immunity even in counties with advanced spread. Our results suggest that local conditions are pertinent to containment and re-opening decisions.",

    "abstract": "Background In order to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK government has imposed strict physical distancing (lockdown) measures including school 'dismissals' since 23 March 2020. As evidence is emerging that these measures may have slowed the spread of the pandemic, it is important to assess the impact of any changes in strategy, including scenarios for school reopening and broader relaxation of social distancing. This work uses an individual-based model to predict the impact of a suite of possible strategies to reopen schools in the UK, including that currently proposed by the UK government. Methods We use Covasim, a stochastic agent-based model for transmission of COVID-19, calibrated to the UK epidemic. The model describes individuals' contact networks stratified as household, school, work and community layers, and uses demographic and epidemiological data from the UK. We simulate a range of different school reopening strategies with a society-wide relaxation of lockdown measures and in the presence of different non-pharmaceutical interventions, to estimate the number of new infections, cumulative cases and deaths, as well as the effective reproduction number with different strategies. To account for uncertainties within the stochastic simulation, we also simulated different levels of infectiousness of children and young adults under 20 years old compared to older ages. Findings We found that with increased levels of testing of people (between 25% and 72% of symptomatic people tested at some point during an active COVID-19 infection depending on scenarios) and effective contact-tracing and isolation for infected individuals, an epidemic rebound may be prevented across all reopening scenarios, with the effective reproduction number (R) remaining below one and the cumulative number of new infections and deaths significantly lower than they would be if testing did not increase. If UK schools reopen in phases from June 2020, prevention of a second wave would require testing 51% of symptomatic infections, tracing of 40% of their contacts, and isolation of symptomatic and diagnosed cases. However, without such measures, reopening of schools together with gradual relaxing of the lockdown measures are likely to induce a secondary pandemic wave, as are other scenarios for reopening. When infectiousness of <20 year olds was varied from 100% to 50% of that of older ages, our findings remained unchanged. Interpretation To prevent a secondary COVID-19 wave, relaxation of social distancing including reopening schools in the UK must be implemented alongside an active large-scale population-wide testing of symptomatic individuals and effective tracing of their contacts, followed by isolation of symptomatic and diagnosed individuals. Such combined measures have a greater likelihood of controlling the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and preventing a large number of COVID-19 deaths than reopening schools and society with the current level of implementation of testing and isolation of infected individuals.",

    "abstract": "Background: Early detection and risk mitigation efforts are essential for averting large outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2. Active surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 can aid in early detection of outbreaks, but the testing frequency required to identify an outbreak at its earliest stage is unknown. We assess what testing frequency is required to detect an outbreak before there are 10 detectable infections. Methods: A dynamic compartmental transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 was developed to simulate spread among a university community. After introducing a single infection into a fully susceptible population, we calculate the probability of detecting at least one case on each succeeding day with various NAT testing frequencies (daily testing achieving 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the population tested per month) assuming an 85% test sensitivity. A proportion of infected individuals (varied from 1-60%) are assumed to present to health services (HS) for symptomatic testing. We ascertain the expected number of detectable infections in the community when there is a >90% probability of detecting at least 1 case. Sensitivity analyses examine impact of transmission rates (Rt=0=2, 2.5,3), presentation to HS (1%/5%/30%/60%), and pre-existing immunity (0%/10%) Results: Assuming an 85% test sensitivity, identifying an outbreak with 90% probability when the expected number of detectable infections is 9 or fewer requires NAT testing of 100% of the population per month; this result holds for all transmission rates and all levels of presentation at health services we considered. . If 1% of infected people present at HS and Rt=0=3, testing 75%/50%/25% per month could identify an outbreak when the expected numbers of detectable infections are 12/17/30 respectively; these numbers decline to 9/11/12 if 30% of infected people present at HS . As proportion of infected individuals present at health services increases, the marginal impact of active surveillance is reduced. Higher transmission rates result in shorter time to detection but also rapidly escalating cases without intervention. Little differences were observed with 10% pre-existing immunity. Conclusions: Widespread testing of 100% of the campus population every month is required to detect an outbreak when there are fewer than 9 detectable infections for the scenarios examined, but high presentation of symptomatic people at HS can compensate in part for lower levels of testing. Early detection is necessary, but not sufficient, to curtail disease outbreaks; the proposed testing rates would need to be accompanied by case isolation, contact tracing, quarantine, and other risk mitigation and social distancing interventions.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study aims to critically assess the published studies of Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for the treatment of COVID-19 and provide recommendations for future clinical trials for the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: A rapid systematic review was conducted by searching the PubMed, Embase, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases on April 13, 2020. Three clinical trial registry platforms, including ClinicalTrials.gov, the EU Clinical Trials Register, and the Chinese Clinical Trial Register were also complementarily searched. Results: A total of 10 clinical studies were identified, including 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 1 comparative nonrandomized trial, 5 single-arm trials, and 1 interim analysis. The heterogeneity among studies of the baseline disease severity and reported endpoints made a pooled analysis impossible. CQ and HCQ (with or without azithromycin) showed significant therapeutic benefit in terms of virologic clearance rate, improvement in symptoms and imaging findings, time to clinical recovery, and length of hospital stay in 1 RCT, 4 single-arm trials, and the interim analysis, whereas no treatment benefit of CQ or HCQ was observed in the remaining 4 studies. Limitations of the included studies ranged from small sample size, to insufficient information concerning baseline patient characteristics, to potential for selection bias without detailing the rationale for exclusion, and presence of confounding factors. Conclusion: Based on the studies evaluated, there still lacked solid evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of HCQ and CQ as a treatment for COVID-19 with or without azithromycin. This emphasized the importance of robust RCTs investing HCQ/CQ to address the evidence uncertainties. Keywords: COVID-19, Systematic review, Clinical trial, Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Smokers are generally more susceptible to infectious respiratory diseases and are at higher risk of developing severe complications from these infections. Conflicting reports exist regarding the impact of smoking on the risk of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. METHODS We carried out a population-based study among over 3,000,000 adult members of Clalit Health Services, the largest health provider in Israel. Since the beginning of the disease outbreak, 114,545 individuals underwent RT-PCR testing for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and 4.0% had positive results. We performed a case-control study among patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing, to assess the impact of smoking on infection incidence and severity. Individuals with positive tests were matched in a 1:5 ratio to individuals tested negative, of the same sex, age, and ethnicity/religion. Conditional logistic regressions were performed to evaluate odds ratios for current and previous smoking on the risk of testing positive. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed among patients infected with COVID-19 to estimate the association between smoking and fatal or severe disease requiring ventilation. Regressions were performed with and without adjustment for preexisting medical conditions. RESULTS In the matched cohort, current smokers (9.8%) were significantly less prevalent among members tested positive compared to the general population, and to matched members tested negative (19.4%, P<0.001). Current smoking was associated with significantly reduced odds ratio (OR) for testing positive OR=0.457 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.407-0.514). Among patients tested positive, there was no evidence of significantly increased risk of developing severe or fatal disease. CONCLUSION The risk of infection by COVID-19 appears to be reduced by half among current smokers. This intriguing finding may reveal unique infection mechanisms present for COVID-19 which may be targeted to combat the disease and reduce its infection rate.",

    "abstract": "On March 17, 2020, French authorities implemented a nationwide lockdown to respond to COVID-19 epidemic and curb the surge of patients requiring critical care, similarly to other countries. Evaluating the impact of lockdown on population mobility is essential to quantify achievable reductions and identify the factors driving the changes in social dynamics that affected viral diffusion. We used temporally resolved travel flows among 1,436 administrative areas of mainland France reconstructed from mobile phone trajectories. We measured mobility changes before and during lockdown at both local and country scales. Lockdown caused a 65% reduction in countrywide number of displacements, and was particularly effective in reducing work-related short-range mobility, especially during rush hours, and recreational trips. Geographical heterogeneities showed anomalous increases in long-range movements even before lockdown announcement that were tightly localized in space. During lockdown, mobility drops were unevenly distributed across regions. They were strongly associated with active population, workers employed in sectors highly impacted by lockdown, and number of hospitalizations per region, and moderately associated with socio-economic level of the region. Major cities largely shrank their pattern of connectivity, reducing it mainly to short-range commuting. Lockdown was effective in reducing population mobility across scales. Caution should be taken in the timing of policy announcements and implementation, as anomalous mobility followed policy announcements that may act as seeding events. On the other hand, risk aversion may be beneficial in further decreasing mobility in largely affected regions. Socio-economic and demographic constraints to the efficacy of restrictions were also identified. The unveiled links between geography, demography, and timing of the response to mobility restrictions may help design interventions that minimize invasiveness while contributing to the current epidemic response.",

    "abstract": "Background: The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is threatening a surging number of populations worldwide, including women in breastfeeding period. Limited evidence is available concerning breastfeeding in women with COVID-19. Methods: Twenty-three pregnant women and puerperae were enrolled in the study. To evaluate the effect of breastfeeding on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the presence of SARS-CoV-2, IgG and IgM in breast milk, maternal blood and infant blood were assessed. Feeding patterns were also recorded in follow-up. Results: No positive detection for SARS-CoV-2 of neonates was found. All breast milk samples were negative for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The presence of IgM ofSARS-CoV-2 in breast milk was correlated with maternal blood. The results of IgG detection for SARS-CoV-2 were negative in all breast milk samples. All the infants were in healthy condition while six of them were fed with whole or partial breast milk. Eight infants received antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 in one month after birth and the results were all negative. Conclusion: Findings from this small number of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for mother-to-child transmission via breast feeding in women with COVID-19 in the third trimester and puerperium.",

    "abstract": "Background: Numerous clinical studies are now underway investigating aspects of COVID-19. The aim of this study was to identify a selection of national and/or multicentre clinical COVID-19 studies in the United Kingdom to examine the feasibility and outcomes of documenting the most frequent data elements common across studies to rapidly inform future study design and demonstrate proof-of-concept for further subject-specific study data element mapping to improve research data management. Methods: 25 COVID-19 studies were included. For each, information regarding the specific data elements being collected was recorded. Data elements collated were arbitrarily divided into categories for ease of visualisation. Elements which were most frequently and consistently recorded across studies are presented in relation to their relative commonality. Results: Across the 25 studies, 261 data elements were recorded in total. The most frequently recorded 100 data elements were identified across all studies and are presented with relative frequencies. Categories with the largest numbers of common elements included demographics, admission criteria, medical history and investigations. Mortality and need for specific respiratory support were the most common outcome measures, but with specific studies including a range of other outcome measures. Conclusion: The findings of this study have demonstrated that it is feasible to collate specific data elements recorded across a range of studies investigating a specific clinical condition in order to identify those elements which are most common among studies. These data may be of value for those establishing new studies and to allow researchers to rapidly identify studies collecting data of potential use hence minimising duplication and increasing data re-use and interoperability",

    "abstract": "Background: controversy has arisen in the scientific community on whether the use of renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors in the context of COVID-19 would be of benefit or harmful. A meta-analysis of eligible studies comparing the occurrence of severe and fatal COVID-19 in infected patients who were under treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) vs no treatment or other antihypertensives was conducted. Methods: PubMed, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Library, MedRxiv and BioRxiv were searched for relevant studies. Fixed-effect models or random-effect models were used depending on the heterogeneity between estimates. Results: a total of fifteen studies with 21,614 patients were included. The use of RAS inhibitors was associated with a non-significant 20% decreased risk of the composite outcome (death, admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation requirement or progression to severe or critical pneumonia): RR 0.81 (95%CI: 0.63-1.04), p=0.10, I2=82%. In a subgroup analysis that included hypertensive subjects only, ACEI/ARB were associated with a 27% significant decrease in the risk of the composite outcome (RR 0.73 (95%CI: 0.56-0.96), p=0.02, I2=65%). Conclusion: the results of this pooled analysis suggest that the use of ACEI/ARB does not worsen the prognosis, and could even be protective in hypertensive subjects. Patients should continue these drugs during their COVID-19 illness.",

    "abstract": "Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular entry point for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) - the cause of COVID-19 disease. It has been hypothesized that use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibiting medications in patients with hypertension, increases the expression of ACE2 and thereby increases the risk of COVID-19 infection and severe outcomes or death. However, the effect of RAS-inhibition on ACE2 expression in human tissues of key relevance to blood pressure regulation and COVID-19 infection has not previously been reported. We examined how hypertension, its major metabolic co-phenotypes and antihypertensive medications relate to ACE2 renal expression using information from up to 436 patients whose kidney transcriptomes were characterised by RNA-sequencing. We further validated some of the key observations in other human tissues and/or a controlled experimental model. Our data reveal increasing expression of ACE2 with age in both human lungs and the kidney. We show no association between renal expression of ACE2 and either hypertension or common types of RAS inhibiting drugs. We demonstrate that renal abundance of ACE2 is positively associated with a biochemical index of kidney function and show a strong enrichment for genes responsible for kidney health and disease in ACE2 co-expression analysis. Collectively, our data indicate that neither hypertension nor antihypertensive treatment are likely to alter individual risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or influence clinical outcomes in COVID-19 through changes of ACE2 expression. Our data further suggest that in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, kidney ACE2 is most likely nephro-protective but the age-related increase in its expression within lungs and kidneys may be relevant to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "Background The COVID-19 pandemic is creating significant challenges for healthcare infrastructure for countries of all development and resource levels. Low-and-middle resource countries face even larger challenges, as their resources are stretched and often insufficient under normal circumstances. A village in the Papuan highlands of Indonesia; small, isolated, accessed only by small plane or trekking has experienced an outbreak typical of COVID-19. Methodology/Principal Findings This description was compiled from patient care records by lay healthcare workers in M20 (a pseudonym) during and after an outbreak and from medical doctors responding to online requests for help. We assume that, for reasons given, the outbreak that has been described was COVID-19. The dense social structure of the village resulted in a rapid infection of 90-95% of the population. Physical distancing and isolation measures were used, but probably implemented suboptimal and too late, and their effect on the illness course was unclear. The relatively young population, with a majority of women, probably influenced the impact of the epidemic, resulting in only two deaths so far. Conclusions/Significance This outbreak pattern of suspected SARS-CoV-2 in a village in the highlands of Papua (Indonesia) presents a unique report of the infection of an entire village population over five weeks. The age distribution, common in Papuan highland villages may have reduced case fatality rate (CFR) in this context and that might be the case in similar remote areas since survival to old age is already very limited and CFR among younger people is lower.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the lockdowns introduced in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK and also explores the potential consequences of different degrees of relaxation. The analysis employs a two-stage SEIR model with different reproductive numbers pre- and post-lockdown. These parameters are estimated from data on the daily number of confirmed cases in a process that automatically detects the time at which the lockdown became effective. The model is evaluated by considering its predictive accuracy on current data and it is then deployed to explore partial relaxations. The results indicate that the different countries have been successful in reducing the reproductive number to values ranging from 0.67 (95% CI: 0.64 - 0.70) to 0.92 (95% CI: 0.89 - 0.95). Results also suggest that a relaxation of 25% could halt the decline in cases in all five countries, while a 50% relaxation could lead to second peaks that are higher and last longer than the earlier peaks in each country. Even though the relaxations so far may have preserved the success of the lockdowns, vigilance is still needed. A relaxation of around 10-15% is recommended if COVID-19 is to continue to decline in all five countries.",

    "abstract": "Background Identification of less costly and accurate methods for monitoring novel coronavirus disease 2019 (CoViD-19) transmission has attracted much interest in recent times. Here, we evaluated a pooling method to determine if this could improve screening efficiency and reduce costs while maintaining accuracy in Guangzhou, China. Methods We evaluated 8097 throat swap samples collected from individuals who came for a health check-up or fever clinic in The Third Affiliated Hospital, Southern Medical University between March 4, 2020 and April 26, 2020. Samples were screened for CoViD-19 infection using the WHO-approved quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) primers. The positive samples were classified into two groups (high or low) based on viral load in accordance with the CT value of COVID-19 RT-qPCR results. Each positive RNA samples were mixed with COVID-19 negative RNA or ddH2O to form RNA pools. Findings Samples with high viral load could be detected in pool negative samples (up to 1/1000 dilution fold). In contrast, the detection of RNA sample from positive patients with low viral load in a pool was difficult and not repeatable. Interpretation Our results show that the COVID-19 viral load significantly influences in pooling efficacy. COVID-19 has distinct viral load profile which depends on the timeline of infection. Thus, application of pooling for infection surveillance may lead to false negatives and hamper infection control efforts.

    "abstract": "COVID-19 can exponentially precipitate life-threatening emergencies as witnessed during the recent spreading of a novel coronavirus infection which can rapidly evolve into lung collapse and respiratory distress (among other various severe clinical conditions). Our study evaluates the performance of a tailor-designed deep convolutional network on the tasks of early detection and localization of radiological signs associated to COVID-19 on frontal chest X-rays. We also asses the frameworks capacity in differentiating the above-mentioned signs, which are usually confused with the more usual common bacterial and viral pneumonias. Open-source chest X-ray images categorized as Normal, Non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 pneumonias were downloaded from the NIH (n=2,259), RSNA (n=600) and HM Hospitales (n=2,307). Our algorithmic framework was able to precisely detect the images with COVID19- related radiological findings (mean Accuracy: 90.5%; Sensitivity: 80.6%; Specificity: 98.0%), whilst correctly categorizing images deemed as Non-COVID-19 pneumonias (mean Accuracy: 88.4%; Sensitivity: 93.3%; Specificity: 92.0%) and normal chest X- rays (mean Accuracy 92.1%; Sensitivity: 91.8%; Specificity: 94.3%). The associated results show that our AI framework is able to classify COVID-19 accurately, making of it a potential tool to improve the diagnostic performance across primary-care centres and, to grant priority to a subset of algorithmic selected images for urgent follow-on expert review. This would sensibly accelerate diagnosis in remote locations, reduce the bottleneck on specialized centres, and/or help to alleviate the needs on situations of scarcity in the availability of molecular tests.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 created a global public health and economic emergency. Policymakers acted quickly and decisively to contain the spread of disease through physical distancing measures. However, these measures also impact physical, mental and economic well-being, creating difficult trade-offs. Here we use a simple mathematical model to explore the balance between public health measures and their associated social and economic costs. Across a range of cost-functions and model structures, commitment to intermittent and strict social distancing measures leads to better overall outcomes than temporally consistent implementation of moderate physical distancing measures. With regard to the trade-offs that policymakers may soon face, our results emphasize that economic and health outcomes do not exist in full competition. Compared to consistent moderation, intermittently strict policies can better mitigate the impact of the pandemic on both of these priorities for a range of plausible utility functions.",

    "abstract": "Background The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been accompanied by the emergence of distinct viral clades, though their clinical significance remains unclear. Here, we aimed to investigate the phylogenetic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Chicago, Illinois and assess their relationship to clinical parameters. Methods We performed whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolates collected from COVID-19 patients in a Chicago healthcare system in mid-March, 2020. Using these and other publicly available sequences, we performed phylogenetic, phylogeographic, and phylodynamic analyses. Patient data was assessed for correlations between demographic or clinical characteristics and virologic features. Findings The 88 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in our study separated into three distinct phylogenetic clades. Clade 1 was most closely related to viral sequences from New York, and showed evidence of rapid expansion across the US, while Clade 3 was most closely related to those in Washington state. Clade 2 was localized primarily to the Chicago area with limited evidence of expansion elsewhere. At the time of diagnosis, patients infected with Clade 1 viruses had significantly higher average viral loads in their upper airways relative to patients infected with Clade 2 viruses, independent of time to symptom onset and disease severity. Interpretation These results show that multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 are circulating in the Chicago area that differ in their relative viral loads in patient upper airways. These data suggest that differences in virus genotype impact viral load and may in turn influence viral transmission and spread.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Hydroxychloroquine and its combination with azithromycin have been suggested to improve viral clearance in patients with COVID-19, but its effect on clinical outcomes remains uncertain. Methods and analysis: We describe the rationale and design of an open-label pragmatic multicentre randomised (concealed) clinical trial of 7 days of hydroxychloroquine (400 mg BID) plus azithromycin (500 mg once daily), hydroxychloroquine 400 mg BID, or standard of care for moderately severe hospitalised patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (in-patients with up to 4L/minute oxygen supply through nasal catheter). Patients are randomised in around 50 recruiting sites and we plan to enrol 630 patients with COVID-19. The primary endpoint is a 7-level ordinal scale measured at 15-days: 1)not hospitalised, without limitations on activities; 2)not hospitalised, with limitations on activities; 3)hospitalised, not using supplementary oxygen; 4)hospitalised, using supplementary oxygen; 5)hospitalised, using high-flow nasal cannula or non-invasive ventilation; 6)hospitalised, on mechanical ventilation; 7)death. Secondary endpoints are the ordinal scale at 7 days, need for mechanical ventilation and rescue therapies during 15 days, need of high-flow nasal cannula or non-invasive ventilation during 15 days, length of hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, thromboembolic events, occurrence of acute kidney injury, and number of days free of respiratory support at 15 days. Secondary safety outcomes include prolongation of QT interval on electrocardiogram, ventricular arrhythmias, and liver toxicity. The main analysis will consider all patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the groups they were randomly assigned. Ethics and dissemination: This study has been approved by Brazil's National Ethic Committee (CONEP) and National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA). An independent data monitoring committee will perform interim analyses and evaluate adverse events throughout the trial. Results will be submitted for publication after enrolment and follow-up are complete, as well as presented and reported to local health agencies. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04322123",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are widely used to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients primarily based on antiviral activity in in vitro studies. Our objective was to systematically evaluate their efficacy and safety in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We systematically reviewed PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Medrxviv for studies of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in COVID-19 hospitalized patients on April 26, 2020. We evaluated the quality of trials and observational studies using the Jadad criteria and Newcastle Ottawa Scale, respectively. RESULTS: After a review of 175 citations, we included 5 clinical trials (total of 345 patients), 9 observational studies (n = 2529), and 6 additional studies (n = 775) reporting on the QT interval. Three studies reported treatment benefits including two studies reporting benefit on virologic outcomes, which was statistically significant in one study, and another reported significant improvement on cough symptoms. Three studies reported that treatment was potentially harmful, including an significantly increased risk of mortality in two studies and increased need for respiratory support in another. Eight studies were unable to detect improvements on virologic outcomes (n = 3) or pneumonia or transfer to ICU/death (n = 5). The proportion of participants with critical QTc intervals of [&ge;] 500 ms or an increase of [&ge;] 60 ms from baseline ranged from 8.3% to 36% (n = 8). One clinical trial and six observational studies were of good quality. The remaining studies were of poor quality. CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review of reported clinical studies did not identify substantial evidence to support the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and raises questions about potential harm from QT prolongation and increased mortality.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide. High-flow nasal cannula therapy (HFNC) is a major oxygen supporting therapy for severely ill patients, but information regarding the timing of HFNC application is scarce, especially in elderly patients. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 110 elderly patients ([&ge;]65 years) who received HFNC from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, People's Hospital of Xiantao City and Chinese Medicine Hospital of Shishou City in Hubei Province, China, and from Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, People's Hospital of Yangjiang City, People's Hospital of Maoming City in Guangdong Province, China. Of the 110 patients, the median age was 71 years (IQR, 68-78) and 59.1% was male. Thirty-eight patients received HFNC when 200 mmHg < PO2/FiO2 [&le;] 300 mmHg (early HFNC group), and 72 patients received HFNC treatment when 100 mmHg < PaO2/FiO2 [&le;] 200 mmHg (late HFNC group). Compared with the late HFNC group, patients in the early HFNC group had a lower likelihood of developing severe ARDS, longer time from illness onset to severe ARDS and shorter duration of viral shedding after illness onset, as well as shorter lengths of ICU and hospital stay. Twenty-four patients died during hospitalization, of whom 22 deaths (30.6%) were in the late HFNC group and 2(5.3%) in the early HFNC group. It is concluded that the prognosis was better in severely ill elderly patients with COVID-19 receiving early compared to late HFNC. This suggests HFNC could be considered early in this disease process.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The association between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) inhibitors and Coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) mortality is unclear. We aimed to explore the association of RAAS inhibitors, including angiotensin-converting inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) with COVID-19 mortality in patients with hypertension. Methods: MEDLINE, SCOPUS, OVID, and Cochrane Library were searched for the period of January 1, 2020 to May 20, 2020. Studies reporting the association of RAAS inhibitors (ACEi and ARBs) and mortality in patients with hypertension, hospitalized for COVID-19 were extracted. Two reviewers independently extracted appropriate data of interest and assessed the risk of bias. All analyses were performed using random-effects models on log-transformed risk ratio estimates, and heterogeneity was quantified. Results: Data were collected on 2,065,805 individuals (mean age, 58.73 years; 53.4% male). Patients with hypertension taking RAAS inhibitors were 35% less likely to die from COVID-19 compared to patients with hypertension not taking RAAS inhibitors (pooled RR= 0.65, 95% Confidence Intervals (CI): 0.45-0.94). To explore the association of COVID-19 and specific classes of RAAS inhibitors, we conducted a subgroup analysis of ARBs and ACEi separately from studies that provided them. Pooled risk ratio estimates from ARBs and ACEi showed a lower but not significant risk of death from COVID-19 (RR=0.93, 95% CI: 0.70-1.22) and ACEi (RR=0.65, 95% CI: 0.32-1.30). Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, it was discovered that taking RAAS inhibitors, significantly decreased the risk of COVID-19 mortality in patients with hypertension. This indicates a potential protective role that RAAS-inhibitors may have in COVID-19 patients with hypertension.",

    "abstract": "In 2020, SARS-CoV-2 impacted Georgia, USA. Georgia announced state-wide shelter-in-place on April 2 and partially lifted restrictions on April 27. We analyzed daily incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases by reporting date, March 2-June 14, in Georgia, Metro Atlanta, and Dougherty County and estimate the time-varying reproduction number, Rt, using R package EpiEstim. The median Rt estimate in Georgia dropped from between 2 and 4 in mid-March, to <2 in late March, and around 1 from mid-April to mid-June. Regarding Metro Atlanta, Rt fluctuated above 1.5 in March and around 1 since April. In Dougherty County, the median Rt declined from around 2 in late March to 0.32 on April 26. In Spring 2020, SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Georgia declined likely because of social distancing measures. However, as restrictions were relaxed in late April, community transmission continued with Rt fluctuating around 1 across Georgia, Metro Atlanta, and Dougherty County as of mid-June.",

    "abstract": "In response to the COVID19 outbreak many countries have implemented lockdown to ensure social distancing. However, long lockdowns globally affected the livelihood of millions of people resulting in subsequent unlocks that started a second wave of infection in multiple countries. Unlocking of the economies critically imposes extra burden on testing and quarantine of the infected people to keep the reproduction number (R0) <1. This, as we demonstrate, requires optimizing a cost-benefit trade-off between testing rate and unlock extent. We delineate a strategy to optimize the trade-off by utilizing a data-trained epidemic model and coupling it with a stochastic agent based model to implement contact tracing. In a country specific manner, we quantitatively demonstrate how combination of unlock and testing can maintain R0 <1.",

    "abstract": "Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is quickly spreading throughout Brazil, which is rapidly ascending the ranking of countries with the highest number of cases and deaths. A particularly unstable federal regime and fragile socioeconomic situation is likely to have contributed to the impact of the disease. Amid this crisis there is substantial concern in the possible socioeconomic, geopolitical and ethnic inequity of the impact of COVID-19 on the country's particularly diverse population. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional observational study of COVID-19 hospital mortality using observational data from the SIVEP-Gripe dataset. We present descriptive statistics to quantify the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. We assess the importance of regional factors such as education, income and health either on a state-by-state basis or by splitting Brazil into a North and a Central-South region. Mixed-effects survival analysis was used to estimate the effects of ethnicity and comorbidity at an individual level in the context of regional variation. Findings: Our results show that, compared to branco comparators, hospitalised pardo and preto Brazilians have significantly higher risk of mortality, with hazard ratios and 95% CI of 1.47 (1.33-1.58) and 1.32 (1.15-1.52), respectively. In particular, pardo ethnicity was the second most important risk factor (after age). We also found that hospitalised Brazilians in North regions tend to have more comorbidities than in the Central-South, with similar proportions between the various ethnic groups. Finally, we found that states in the North have a higher hazard ratio as compared to the Central-South, and that Rio de Janeiro obtained one of the highest hazard ratios, similar to the ones of the more underdeveloped Pernambuco and Amazonas. Interpretation: Our results can be interpreted according to the interplay of two independent, but correlated, effects: i) mortality by COVID-19 increases going North (vertical effect), ii) mortality increases for the pardo and preto population (horizontal effect). We speculate that the vertical effect is driven by increasing levels of comorbidity in Northern regions where levels of socioeconomic development are lower, whereas the horizontal effect may be related to lower levels of healthcare access or availability (including intensive care) for pardo and preto Brazilians. For most states the vertical and horizontal effects are correlated giving a larger cumulative mortality. However, Rio de Janeiro was found to be an outlier to this trend: It has an ethnicity composition (horizontal effect) similar to the states in the North region, despite high levels of socioeconomic development (vertical effect). Our analysis motivates an urgent effort on the part of Brazilian authorities to consider how the national response to COVID-19 can better protect pardo and preto Brazilians as well as the population of poorer states from their higher death risk from SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medications for treating non-resistant malaria, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In addition, both drugs are currently used off-label in hospitals worldwide and in numerous clinical trials for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, CQ and HCQ use has been associated with cardiac side effects, which is of concern due to the higher risk of COVID-19 complications in patients with heart related disorders, and increased mortality associated with COVID-19 cardiac complications. In this study we analyzed over thirteen million adverse event reports form the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System to confirm and quantify the association of cardiac side effects of CQ and HCQ. Additionally, we identified several confounding factors, including male sex, NSAID coadministration, advanced age, and prior diagnoses contributing to the risk of drug related cardiotoxicity. These findings may help guide therapeutic decision making and ethical trial design for COVID-19 treatment.",

    "abstract": "In December 2019, a novel virus named COVID-19 emerged in the city of Wuhan, China. In early 2020, the COVID-19 virus spread in all continents of the world except Antarctica causing widespread infections and deaths due to its contagious characteristics and no medically proven treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic has been termed as the most consequential global crisis after the World Wars. The first line of defense against the COVID-19 spread are the non-pharmaceutical measures like social distancing and personal hygiene. The great pandemic affecting billions of lives economically and socially has motivated the scientific community to come up with solutions based on computer-aided digital technologies for diagnosis, prevention, and estimation of COVID-19. Some of these efforts focus on statistical and Artificial Intelligence-based analysis of the available data concerning COVID- 19. All of these scientific efforts necessitate that the data brought to service for the analysis should be open source to promote the extension, validation, and collaboration of the work in the fight against the global pandemic. Our survey is motivated by the open source efforts that can be mainly categorized as (a) COVID-19 diagnosis from CT scans, X-ray images, and cough sounds, (b) COVID-19 case reporting, transmission estimation, and prognosis from epidemiological, demographic, and mobility data, (c) COVID-19 emotional and sentiment analysis from social media, and (d) knowledge-based discovery and semantic analysis from the collection of scholarly articles covering COVID-19. We survey and compare research works in these directions that are accompanied by open source data and code. Future research directions for data-driven COVID-19 research are also debated. We hope that the article will provide the scientific community with an initiative to start open source extensible and transparent research in the collective fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "RATIONALE: COVID-19 poses a unique challenge; caring for patients with a novel, infectious disease whilst protecting staff. Some interventions used to give oxygen therapy are aerosol generating procedures. Staff delivering such interventions require PPE and are exposed to a significant viral load resulting in sick days and even death. We aim to reduce this risk using an augmented-reality communication device: The HoloLens by Microsoft. OBJECTIVES: In a tertiary centre in London we aim to implement HoloLens technology, allowing other medical staff to remotely join the consulting clinician when in a high-risk patient area delivering oxygen therapy. The study primary outcome was to reduce the exposure to staff and demonstrate non-inferiority staff satisfaction when compared to not using the device. Our secondary outcome was to reduce extrapolated PPE costs when using the device. METHODS: Our study was conducted in March and April 2020, within a respiratory unit delivering aerosolising oxygen therapies (High flow nasal oxygen, Continuous positive airway pressure and non-invasive ventilation) to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported questionnaires to assess satisfaction in key areas of patient care. An infrared people counting device was also used to assess staff in and out of the unit. MAIN RESULTS: Mean self-reported time in the high-risk zone was less when using HoloLens (2.69 hours) compared to usual practice (3.96 hours) although this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.3657). HoloLens showed non-inferiority when compared to usual practice in staff satisfaction score for all domains. Furthermore, mean staff satisfaction score encouragingly improved when using HoloLens. Self-reported PPE counts from this study showed 12 staff members changing PPE 25.8 times per shift, almost double the 13.5 times in the HoloLens count. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated HoloLens can reduce the number of staff exposed to aerosol generating areas in a novel infectious disease. Our results show it did not impair communication, medical staff availability or end of life care. HoloLens technology may also reduce the use of PPE, which has equipment availability and cost benefits. This study provides grounding for further use of the HoloLens device by bringing a bedside experience to experts remote to the situation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: Despite the new SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) be the seventh of the coronavirus family viruses known to cause human disease, little is known about potential symptoms and syndromes secondary to the compromise of the central and peripheral nervous systems. We reviewed neurological manifestations due to the new coronavirus, thus far published in the literature, as well as guidelines issued by sub-specialties in Neurology, to tackle the disease. Methods: we searched medical databases, such as PubMed, PubMed Central, LILACS and Google scholar for papers (case reports, short letters, case series, etc) describing neurological symptoms in patients with confirmed or suspect COVID-19 diagnosis and also searched webpages of associations and organizations that deal with neurological disorders. Results: we describe briefly each article considered for this review. Forty-one papers were found associating neurological conditions and COVID-19. Cases are divided by disease groups and, within each disease group, results are listed in chronological order or publication date. We also discuss briefly recommendations for neurological patients, according to disease group. Conclusion: Although there is evidence of neurological manifestations with previous coronaviruses, COVID-19 is assuring a volume of published papers not seen before for other coronavirus infections. Most neurological cases are not life-threatening, but 10 to 20% of cases will require hospitalization and are in risk for sequelae and death. Although a lot of data coming from these papers is amassing, researchers must bear in mind that many papers currently published are not yet peer-reviewed, and thus are prone to further corrections.",

    "abstract": "Recently, numerous reports have suggested association of pediatric Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and Kawasaki Disease (KD). KD is a major cause of childhood acquired heart disease and vasculitis in the pediatric population. Epidemiological patterns suggest KD is related to an infectious agent; however, the etiology remains unknown1. As past reports have considered other coronaviruses to be related to KD2,3, these reports of pediatric COVID-19 related inflammatory disorder cases leads to the hypothesis of potential cross-coronavirus reactivity that would account for the past controversial proposals of other coronaviruses and these new cases. We sought to address this hypothesis by assessing the antigen targeting of biobanked plasma samples of febrile children, including those with KD, against SARS-CoV-2 proteins.",

    "abstract": "The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a major threat to humans. Recently, we encountered two seemingly separate COVID-19 clusters in a tertiary care medical center. Whole viral genome sequencing detected the haplotype of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and the two clusters were successfully distinguished by the viral genome haplotype. Concurrently, there were nine COVID-19 patients clinically unlinked to clusters #1 or #2 that necessitated the determination of the source of infection. Such patients had similar haplotypes to that in cluster #2 but were devoid of two rare mutations characteristic to cluster #2. This suggested that these nine cases of \"probable community infection\" indeed had community infection and were not derived from cluster #2. Whole viral genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 is a powerful measure not only for monitoring the global trend of SARS-CoV-2 but also for identifying the source of infection of COVID-19 at a level of institution.",

    "abstract": "Background. During infectious disease outbreaks the weakest communities are more vulnerable to the infection and its deleterious effects. In Israel, the Arab and Ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities have unique demographic and cultural characteristics that place them at risk for infection. Objective. To examine the socioeconomic and ethnic differences in relation to COVID-19 testing, cases and deaths, and to analyze infection spread patterns in ethnically diverse communities. Methods. Consecutive data on COVID-19 diagnostic testing, confirmed cases and deaths collected from March 31st through May 1st, 2020 in 174 localities across Israel (84% of the population) were analyzed by socioeconomic ranking and ethnicity. Findings. Tests were performed on 331,594 individuals (4.29% of the total population). Of those, 14,865 individuals (4.48%) were positive and 203 died (1.37% of confirmed cases). The percentage of the population tested was 26% and the risk of testing positive was 2.16 times higher in the lowest, compared with the highest socioeconomic category. The proportion of confirmed cases was 4.96 times higher in the Jewish compared with the Arab population. The rate of confirmed cases in 2 Ultra-Orthodox localities increased relatively early and quickly. Other Jewish and Arab localities showed consistently low rates of confirmed COVID-19 cases, regardless of socioeconomic ranking. Interpretation Culturally different communities reacted differently to the COVID-19 outbreak and to government measures, resulting in different outcomes. Therefore, socioeconomic and ethnic variables cannot fully explain communities reaction to the pandemic. Our findings stress the need for designing a culturally adapted approach for dealing with health crises.",

    "abstract": "Chansu and its major active constituent of bufalin have been reported to have broad-spectrum antiviral effects. This study aims to assess the efficacy of Chansu injection in treating patients with severe COVID-19. The patients diagnosed as severe or critical COVID-19 in The First People's Hospital of Jiangxia District, Wuhan, China from February 5 to March 5, 2020 were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive general treatment plus Chansu injection or only general treatment as the control group. The treatment course was 7 days. The changes of PaO2/FiO2 and ROX index indicating respiratory function, the white blood cell (WBC) count, peripheral blood mononuclear lymphocyte (PBML) count, respiratory support step-down time (RSST), and safety indicators for the 7th day were retrospectively analyzed. After 7 days treatment, the oxygenation index was improved in 20 of 21 patients (95.2%) in the treatment group, as compared with 13 of 19 patients (68.4%) in the control group. The PaO2/FiO2 and ROX indices in the treatment group (mean, 226.27 and 14.01 respectively) were significantly higher than the control group (mean, 143.23 and 9.64 respectively). The RSST was 1 day shorter in the treatment group than the control group. Multivariate regression analysis suggested that Chansu injection contributed the most to the outcome of PaO2/FiO2. No obvious adverse effects were observed. Preliminary data showed that Chansu injection had apparent efficacy in treating patients with severe COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Data for ten European countries which provide detailed distribution of COVID-19 cases by sex and age show that among people of working age, women diagnosed with COVID-19 substantially outnumber infected men. This pattern reverses around retirement: infection rates among women fall at age 60-69, resulting in a cross-over with infection rates among men. The relative disadvantage of women peaks at ages 20-29, whereas the male disadvantage in infection rates peaks at ages 70-79. The elevated infection rates among women of working age are likely tied to their higher share in health- and care-related occupations. Our examination also suggests a link between women's employment profiles and infection rates in prime working ages. The same factors that determine women's higher life expectancy account for their lower fatality and higher male disadvantage at older ages.",

    "abstract": "Importance The degree to which children and young people are infected by and transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus is unclear. The role of children and young people in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on susceptibility, symptoms, viral load, social contact patterns and behaviour. Objective We undertook a rapid systematic review to address the question What is the susceptibility to and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by children and adolescents compared with adults? Data sources We searched PubMed and medRxiv up to 28 July 2020 and identified 13,926 studies, with additional studies identified through handsearching of cited references and professional contacts. Study Selection We included studies which provided data on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children and young people ( <20 years) compared with adults derived from contact-tracing or population-screening. We excluded single household studies. Data extraction and Synthesis We followed PRISMA guidelines for abstracting data, independently by 2 reviewers. Quality was assessed using a critical appraisal checklist for prevalence studies. Random effects meta-analysis was undertaken. Main Outcomes Secondary infection rate (contact-tracing studies) or prevalence or seroprevalence (population-screening studies) amongst children and young people compared with adults. Results 32 studies met inclusion criteria; 18 contact-tracing and 14 population-screening. The pooled odds ratio of being an infected contact in children compared with adults was 0.56 (0.37, 0.85) with substantial heterogeneity (95%). Three school contact tracing studies found minimal transmission by child or teacher index cases. Findings from population-screening studies were heterogenous and were not suitable for meta-analysis. The majority of studies were consistent with lower seroprevalence in children compared with adults, although seroprevalence in adolescents appeared similar to adults. Conclusions There is preliminary evidence that children and young people have lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, with a 43% lower odds of being an infected contact. There is weak evidence that children and young people play a lesser role in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at a population level. Our study provides no information on the infectivity of children.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Following detection of the first virologically-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Great Britain, an enhanced surveillance study was initiated by Public Health England to describe the clinical presentation, course of disease and identify risk factors for infection of the first few hundred cases. Methods: Information was collected on the first COVID-19 cases according to the First Few X WHO protocol. Case-control analyses of the sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of symptoms and risk factors for infection were conducted. Point prevalences of underlying health conditions among the UK general population were presented. Findings: The majority of FF100 cases were imported (51.4%), of which the majority had recent travel to Italy (71.4%). 24.7% were secondary cases acquired mainly through household contact (40.4%). Children had lower odds of COVID-19 infection compared with the general population. The clinical presentation of cases was dominated by cough, fever and fatigue. Non-linear relationships with age were observed for fever, and sensitivity and specificity of symptoms varied by age. Conditions associated with higher odds of COVID-19 infection (after adjusting for age and sex) were chronic heart disease, immunosuppression and multimorbidity. Conclusion: This study presents the first epidemiological and clinical summary of COVID-19 cases in Great Britain. The FFX study design enabled systematic data collection. The study was able to characterize the risk factors for infection with population prevalence estimates setting these relative risks into a public health context. It also provides important evidence for generating case definitions to support public health risk assessment, clinical triage and diagnostic algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Background Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infects human lung tissue cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), and the body sodium is an important factor for regulating the expression of ACE2. Through a systematic review, meta-analysis and retrospective cohort study, we found that the low blood sodium population may significantly increase the risk and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We extracted the data of serum sodium concentrations of patients with COVID-19 on admission from the articles published between Jan 1 and April 28, 2020, and analyzed the relationship between the serum sodium concentrations and the illness severity of patients. Then we used a cohort of 244 patients with COVID-19 for a retrospective analysis. Results We identified 36 studies, one of which comprised 2736 patients.The mean serum sodium concentration in patients with COVID-19 was 138.6 mmol/L, which was much lower than the median level in population (142.0). The mean serum sodium concentration in severe/critical patients (137.0) was significantly lower than those in mild and moderate patients (140.8 and 138.7, respectively). Such findings were confirmed in a retrospective cohort study, of which the mean serum sodium concentration in all patients was 137.5 mmol/L, and the significant differences were found between the mild (139.2) and moderate (137.2) patients, and the mild and severe/critical (136.6) patients. Interestingly, such changes were not obvious in the serum chlorine and potassium concentrations. Conclusions The low sodium state of patients with COVID-19 may not be the consequence of virus infection, but could be a physiological state possibly caused by living habits such as low salt diet and during aging process, which may result in ACE2 overexpression, and increase the risk and severity of COVID-19. These findings may provide a new idea for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Background: Healthcare professionals (HCPs) on the front lines against COVID-19 may face increased workload, and stress. Understanding HCPs risk for burnout is critical to supporting HCPs and maintaining the quality of healthcare during the pandemic. Methods: To assess exposure, perceptions, workload, and possible burnout of HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic we conducted a cross-sectional survey. The main outcomes and measures were HCPs self-assessment of burnout and other experiences and attitudes associated with working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: A total of 2,707 HCPs from 60 countries participated in this study. Fifty-one percent of HCPs reported burnout. Burnout was associated with work impacting household activities (RR=1.57, 95% CI=1.39-1.78, P<0.001), feeling pushed beyond training (RR=1.32, 95% CI=1.20-1.47, P<0.001), exposure to COVID-19 patients (RR=1.18, 95% CI=1.05-1.32, P=0.005), making life prioritizing decisions (RR=1.16, 95% CI=1.02-1.31, P=0.03). Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) was protective against burnout (RR=0.88, 95% CI=0.79-0.97, P=0.01). Burnout was higher in high-income countries (HICs) compared to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (RR=1.18; 95% CI=1.02-1.36, P=0.018). Interpretation: Burnout is prevalent at higher than previously reported rates among HCPs working during the COVID-19 pandemic and is related to high workload, job stress, and time pressure, and limited organizational support. Current and future burnout among HCPs could be mitigated by actions from healthcare institutions and other governmental and non-governmental stakeholders aimed at potentially modifiable factors, including providing additional training, organizational support, support for family, PPE, and mental health resources.

    "abstract": "We report four cases of subacute encephalopathy occurring in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. All patients have been intubated in the first week from onset of ARDS and presented neurological signs of agitation and spatial disorientation after weaning from mechanical ventilation. The MRI picture and the clinical features are described. MRI lesions characteristics are unusual but demonstrate a highly consistent pattern through all the four patients with similar neurological symptoms. They do not fulfill any typical criteria for a definite neuroradiological entity. Their predominantly parieto-occipital distribution recalls posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), although the prevalent cortical involvement and diffusion MRI pattern are not typical of PRES. We speculate that this pattern may be related to a possible transient dysregulation of vasomotor reactivity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: It is a painful job to predict the death of people. But sometimes it is important to predict the future and concern the government. A furious future is waiting for Bangladesh. Objective: Objective of the study is to assume the number of positive case and death till 30th December, 2020 in Bangladesh. Study design: This study was designed with systematic review and data analysis. Method: The study was completed by analyzing data available on website. First COVID 19 case in Bangladesh was identified on 8th March. Analyzing the data increasing rate/common ratio of infection and death has been identified. Then this common ratio has been used in the formula of multiplication series. Data of China, Iran, Italy and the USA was also analyzed to assume how the death and case number increased. Social issues of Bangladesh were also analyzed. Considering all these the assumption was made. Result: It has been assumed that by the 43rd week (on 30th December, 2020) of first identification the total case can be 17024322 and total death can be 86265 by 30 December, 2020. As this is an assumption this can be true, partially true or false. But the base of assumption is strong enough so the possibility of being true or nearly true is higher. Policy Suggestion: Government should choose properly one between two options. Either government should declare curfew or let people lead normal life. A very weak lock down for a long time does not make any sense.",

    "abstract": "Background: Data on patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who return to hospital after discharge are scarce. Characterization of these patients may inform post-hospitalization care. Methods and Findings: Retrospective cohort study of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 discharged alive from five hospitals in New York City with index hospitalization between February 27th-April 12th, 2020, with follow-up of [&ge;]14 days. Significance was defined as P<0.05 after multiplying P by 125 study-wide comparisons. Of 2,864 discharged patients, 103 (3.6%) returned for emergency care after a median of 4.5 days, with 56 requiring inpatient readmission. The most common reason for return was respiratory distress (50%). Compared to patients who did not return, among those who returned there was a higher proportion of COPD (6.8% vs 2.9%) and hypertension (36% vs 22.1%). Patients who returned also had a shorter median length of stay (LOS) during index hospitalization (4.5 [2.9,9.1] vs. 6.7 [3.5, 11.5] days; Padjusted=0.006), and were less likely to have required intensive care on index hospitalization (5.8% vs 19%; Padjusted=0.001). A trend towards association between absence of in-hospital anticoagulation on index admission and return to hospital was also observed (20.9% vs 30.9%, Padjusted=0.064). On readmission, rates of intensive care and death were 5.8% and 3.6%, respectively. Conclusions: Return to hospital after admission for COVID-19 was infrequent within 14 days of discharge. The most common cause for return was respiratory distress. Patients who returned had higher proportion of COPD and hypertension with shorter LOS on index hospitalization, and a trend towards lower rates of in-hospital treatment-dose anticoagulation. Future studies should focus on whether these comorbid conditions, longer LOS and anticoagulation are associated with reduced readmissions.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether prevalence of Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is modulated by meteorological conditions, we herein conducted meta-regression of data in large U.S. cities. We selected 33 large U.S. cities with a population of >500,000. The integrated numbers of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the country to which the city belongs on 14 May 2020, the estimated population in 2019 in the country, and monthly meteorological conditions at the city for 4 months (from January to April 2020) were obtained. Meteorological conditions consisted of mean temperature (F), total precipitation (inch), mean wind speed (MPH), mean sky cover, and mean relative humidity (%). Monthly data for 4 months were averaged or integrated. The Covid-19 prevalence was defined as the integrated number of Covid-19 cases divided by the population. Random-effects meta-regression was performed by means of OpenMetaAnalyst. In a meta-regression graph, Covid-19 prevalence (plotted as the logarithm transformed prevalence on the y-axis) was depicted as a function of a given factor (plotted as a meteorological datum on the x-axis). A slope of the meta-regression line was significantly negative (coefficient, -0.069; P < 0.001) for the mean temperature and significantly positive for the mean wind speed (coefficient, 0.174; P = 0.027) and the sky cover (coefficient, 2.220; P = 0.023). In conclusion, lower temperature and higher wind speed/sky cover may be associated with higher Covid-19 prevalence, which should be confirmed by further epidemiological researches adjusting for various risk and protective factors (in addition to meteorological conditions) of Covid-19.",

It is a potentially fatal disease to many vulnerable patients including the elderly and those with chronic illnesses; but because this virus is a novel one, there are no firmly established treatment protocols. Many treatment methods are being investigated worldwide, and scientific conclusions drawn from these endeavors are crucial for healthcare professionals in combating this disease. In this network meta-analysis, we focus specifically on the pharmacologic agents that have been investigated for the treatment of COVID-19 and aim to produce a comprehensive picture of the evidence from current data in order to produce relevant insights on the comparative efficacy and safety profiles of various pharmacologic agents against COVID-19.",

It can be difficult to accurately predict mortality among COVID-19 patients presenting with a spectrum of complications, hindering the prognostication and management of the disease. Methods: We applied machine learning techniques to clinical data from a large cohort of 5,051 COVID-19 patients treated at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, the global COVID-19 epicenter, to predict mortality. Predictors were designed to classify patients into Deceased or Alive mortality classes and were evaluated in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC score). Findings: Using a development cohort (n=3,841) and a systematic machine learning framework, we identified a COVID-19 mortality predictor that demonstrated high accuracy (AUC=0.91) when applied to test sets of retrospective (n= 961) and prospective (n=249) patients. This mortality predictor was based on five clinical features: age, minimum O2 saturation during encounter, type of patient encounter (inpatient vs. various types of outpatient and telehealth encounters), hydroxychloroquine use, and maximum body temperature. Interpretation: An accurate and parsimonious COVID-19 mortality predictor based on five features may have utility in clinical settings to guide the management and prognostication of patients affected by this disease.",

    "abstract": "Background: Real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) is commonly used to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection. Heat inactivation prior to nucleic acid isolation may allow safe testing, while the effects of heat inactivation on SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR detection result need to be determined. Methods: 14 positive nasopharyngeal swab specimens were inactivated at 56{degrees}C for 30min, 56{degrees}C for 60min, 60{degrees}C for 30min, 60{degrees}C for 75min, and 100{degrees}C for 10min, and another 2 positive nasopharyngeal swab specimens were also inactivated at 100{degrees}C for 10min, 100{degrees}C for 30min, 100{degrees}C for 60min, after which the samples were isolated and detected by rRT-PCR. Results: All 14 heat treated samples remained positive. The range of threshold cycle (Ct) values observed when detecting ORF1a/b was 27.228-34.011 in heat-treated samples, while 25.281-34.861 in unheated samples, and the range of threshold cycle (Ct) values observed at the time of detecting N was 25.777-33.351 in heat-treated samples, while 24.1615-35.433 in unheated samples, on basis of which it showed no statistical difference otherwise a good correlation of Ct values between the heat-inactivated samples and the untreated samples. However, the 2 samples inactivated at 100{degrees}C 30min, 100{degrees}C 60min turned into negative. Conclusions: Heat inactivation at 56{degrees}C for 30min, 56{degrees}C for 60min, 60{degrees}C for 30min, 60{degrees}C for 75min, and 100{degrees}C for 10min shall not affect the detection results of Real-Time Reverse Transcription PCR of the SARS-COV2. Furthermore, it is recommended to inactive nasopharyngeal swab specimens 10min at 100{degrees}C before RNA extraction in consideration of efficiency and reliable results.

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 beta coronavirus is spreading globally with unprecedented consequences for modern societies. The early detection of infected individuals is a pre-requisite for all strategies aiming to contain the virus. Currently, purification of RNA from patient samples followed by RT-PCR is the gold standard to assess the presence of this single-strand RNA virus. However, these procedures are time consuming, require continuous supply of specialized reagents, and are prohibitively expensive in resource-poor settings. Here, we report an improved nucleic-acid-based approach to detect SARS-CoV-2, which alleviates the need to purify RNA, reduces handling steps, minimizes costs, and allows evaluation by non-specialized equipment. The use of unprocessed swap samples and the ability to detect as little as three viral genome equivalents is enabled by employing a heat-stable RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, which performs the double task of stringent reverse transcription of RNA at elevated temperatures as well as PCR amplification of a SARS-CoV-2 specific target gene. As results are obtained within 2 hours and can be read-out by a hand-held LED-screen, this novel protocol will be of particular importance for large-scale virus surveillance in economically constrained settings.",

    "abstract": "Background. The COVID pandemic has had a major impact on healthcare in hospitals, including the diagnosis and treatment of infections. Hospital-acquired infective endocarditis (HAIE) is a severe complication of medical procedures that has shown a progressive increase in recent years. Objectives. to determine whether the incidence of HAIE during the first two months of the epidemic (March-April 2020) was higher than previously observed and to describe the clinical characteristics of these cases. The probability of studied event (HAIE) during the studied period was calculate by Poisson distribution. Results. Four cases of HAIE were diagnosed in our institution during the study period. The incidence of HAIE during the study period was 2/patient-month and 0.25/patient-month during the previous 5 years (p=0.024). Two cases appeared during admission for COVID-19 with pulmonary involvement treated with metilprednisolone and tocilizumab. The other two cases were admitted to the hospital during the epidemic. All cases underwent central venous and urinary catheterization during admission. The etiology of HAIE was Enterococcus faecalis (2 cases), Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans (one case each). A source of infection was identified in three cases (central venous catheter, peripheral venous catheter, sternal wound infection, respectively). One patient was operated on. There were no fatalities during the first 30 days of follow-up. Conclusion. The incidence of HAIE during COVID-19 pandemic in our institution was higher than usual. In order to reduce the risk of this serious infection, optimal catheter care, appropriate use of corticosteroids and interleukin antagonists and early treatment of every local infection should be prioritized during coronavirus outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "The reproduction number, R0, is commonly used, and sometimes misused, in conjunction with the classic Kermack and McKindrick theory based on the assumption of homogeneity, in order to estimate herd immunity threshold (HIT). This provides a crude first estimate of HIT, with more elaborate modelling required to arrive at a more realistic value. Early estimates of HIT for Covid-19 were based on this simplistic homogeneous approach, yielding high HIT values that have since been revised downwards with more sophisticated network modelling taking account of R0 heterogeneity and with reference to the low HIT found from serological sampling in Stockholm County. The aim of this paper is to describe a simple model in which host susceptibility is directly linked to the heterogeneous R0 distribution, to shed further light on the mechanisms involved and to arrive at a bimodal R0 distribution consistent with the Covid-19 HIT observed in Stockholm County.",

In this study, the observed case fatality rates of 46 different countries are hypothesized to be dependent on their testing rates. An analytical test to this hypothesis suggests that the case fatality rate of COVID-19 could be consistent to a certain degree across all countries and states. The current global fatality rate is estimated to be around 1% and expected to converge between 1-3% when the pandemic ends. This model can be helpful to estimate the true infection rate for individual countries.",

    "abstract": "Background: The swift spread of SARS-CoV-2 provides a challenge worldwide. As a consequence of restrictive public health measures like isolation, quarantine, and community containment, the provision of mental health services is a major challenge. Evidence from past virus epidemics and the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak indicate high prevalence rates of mental health problems (MHP) as short- and long-term consequences. However, a broader picture of MHP among different populations is still lacking. Methods: We conducted a rapid review on MHP prevalence rates published since 2000, during and after epidemics, including the general public, health care workers, and survivors. Any quantitative articles reporting on MHP rates were included. Out of 2855 articles screened, a total of 74 were included in this review. Results: Most original studies on MHP were conducted in China in the context of SARS-CoV-1, and reported on anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms/disorder, general psychiatric morbidity, and psychological symptoms. The MHP rates across studies, populations, and epidemics vary substantially. While some studies show high and persistent rates of MHP in populations directly affected by isolation, quarantine, threat of infection, infection, or life-threatening symptoms (e.g. health care workers), other studies report minor effects. Furthermore, even less affected populations (e.g. distant to epidemic epicenter, no contact history with suspected or confirmed cases) can show high rates of MHP. Discussion: MHP vary largely across countries and risk-groups in reviewed studies. The results call attention to potentially high MHP during epidemics. Individuals affected directly by an epidemic might be at a higher risk of short or even long-term mental health impairments. This study delivers insights stemming from a wide range of psychiatric instruments and questionnaires. The results call for the use of validated and standardized instruments, reference norms, and pre-post measurements to better understand the magnitude of the MHP during and after the epidemics. Nevertheless, emerging MHP should be considered during epidemics including the provision of access to mental health care to mitigate potential mental impairments.",

Currently, the world is facing a health and socioeconomic crisis caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and its disease COVID-19. Therefore, in less than four months, researchers have published a significant number of articles related to this novel virus. For instance, a search focused on the Scopus database on April 10, 2020, showed 1224 documents published by authors with 1797 affiliations from 80 countries. 25.4%, 24.0%, and 12.6% of these national affiliations were from China, Europe, and the USA, respectively, making these regions leaders in COVID-19 research. In the case of Latin America, on April 10, 2020, we searched different databases, such as Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science, finding that the contribution of this region was 2.7% of the total publications found. In other words, we found 153 publications related to COVID-19 with at least one Latin American researcher. We summarized and processed the information from these 153 publications, finding active participation in topics like medical, social, and environmental considerations, bioinformatics, and epidemiology.",

    "abstract": "Background: COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease which has been declared a Pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11th March 2020. The Indian public health care system is already overstretched, and this pandemic is making things even worse. That is why forecasting cases for India is necessary to meet the future demands of the health infrastructure caused due to COVID-19. Objective: Our study forecasts the confirmed and active cases for COVID-19 until July mid, using time series Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. Additionally, we estimated the number of isolation beds, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds and ventilators required for the growing number of COVID-19 patients. Methods: We used ARIMA model for forecasting confirmed and active cases till the 15th July. We used time-series data of COVID-19 cases in India from 14th March to 22nd May. We estimated the requirements for ICU beds as 10%, ventilators as 5% and isolation beds as 85% of the active cases forecasted using the ARIMA model. Results: Our forecasts indicate that India will have an estimated 7,47,772 confirmed cases (95% CI: 493943, 1001601) and 296,472 active cases (95% CI:196820, 396125) by 15th July. While Maharashtra will be the most affected state, having the highest number of active and confirmed cases, Punjab is expected to have an estimated 115 active cases by 15th July. India needs to prepare 2,52,001 isolation beds (95% CI: 167297, 336706), 29,647 ICU beds (95% CI: 19682, 39612), and 14,824 ventilator beds (95% CI: 9841, 19806). Conclusion: Our forecasts show an alarming situation for India, and Maharashtra in particular. The actual numbers can go higher than our estimated numbers as India has a limited testing facility and coverage.",

    "abstract": "Sao Paulo State registered the first case of CoViD-19 on 26 February, the first death due to CoViD-19 on 16 March, and implemented the isolation of the population in non- essential activities on 24 March, which is programmed to end on 1 June. A mathematical model considering young (below 60 years old) and elder (above 60 years) subpopulations was formulated based on the natural history of CoViD-19 to study the transmission of the new coronavirus in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. This deterministic model used the data collected in Sao Paulo State to estimate the model parameters and to evaluate the effects of herd protection, that is, isolation and personal and collective protective measures. Based on the estimated parameters, we evaluated the scenarios of three releases divided in equal proportions elapsed by 14 days between releases, but beginning in three different times (the first release occurring on 1 and 23 June, and 6 July). We concluded that these three strategies of release are equivalent (little difference) in reducing the number of severe CoViD-19 if social behaviour does not change. However, if protective measures as using face mask and hygiene (washing hands, for instance) and social distancing could be massively disseminated in the population to decrease the transmission of CoViD-19 by 80%, we concluded that the health care system may not collapse with release.",

    "abstract": "Importance: COVID-19 is a clinically heterogeneous disease of varying severity and prognosis. Clinical characteristics that impact disease course could offer guidance for clinical decision making and future research endeavors and unveil disease pathways. Objective: To examine risk factors associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Data sources: We performed a systematic review in PubMed from January 1 until April 19, 2020. Study selection: Observational studies that examined the association of any clinical characteristic with an adverse clinical outcome were considered eligible. We scrutinized studies for potential overlap. Data extraction and synthesis: Information on the effect of clinical factors on clinical endpoints of patients with COVID-19 was independently extracted by two researchers. When an effect size was not reported, crude odds ratios were calculated based on the available information from the eligible articles. Study-specific effect sizes from non-overlapping studies were synthesized applying the random-effects model. Main outcome and measure: The examined outcomes were severity and progression of disease, admission to ICU, need for mechanical ventilation, mortality, or a composite outcome. Results: We identified 88 eligible articles, and we performed a total of 256 meta-analyses on the association of 98 unique risk factors with five clinical outcomes. Seven meta-analyses presented the strongest epidemiological evidence in terms of statistical significance (P-value <0.005), between-study heterogeneity (I2 <50%), sample size (more than 1000 COVID-19 patients), 95% prediction interval excluded the null value, and absence of small-study effects. Elevated C-reactive protein (OR, 6.46; 95% CI, 4.85 - 8.60), decreased lymphocyte count (OR, 4.16; 95% CI, 3.17 - 5.45), cerebrovascular disease (OR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.55 - 5.20), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 4.44; 95% CI, 2.46 - 8.02), diabetes mellitus (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.54 - 2.70), hemoptysis (OR, 7.03; 95% CI, 4.57 - 10.81), and male sex (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.30 - 1.75) were associated with risk of severe COVID-19. Conclusions and relevance: Our results highlight factors that could be useful for prognostic model building, help guide patients' selection for randomized clinical trials, as well as provide alternative treatment targets by shedding light to disease pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Visiting parks and gardens may attenuate the adverse physical and mental health impacts of social distancing implemented to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We quantified access to public parks and gardens in urban areas of England and Wales, and the potential for park crowdedness during periods of high use. We combined data from the Office for National Statistics and Ordnance Survey to quantified (i) the number of parks within 500 and 1,000 metres of urban postcodes (i.e., availability), (ii) the distance of postcodes to the nearest park (i.e., accessibility), and (iii) per-capita space in each park for people living within 1,000m. We examined variability by city and share of flats. Around 25.4 million people can access public parks or gardens within a ten-minute walk, while 3.8 million residents live farther away; of these 21% are children and 13% are elderly. Areas with a higher share of flats on average are closer to a park but people living in these areas are potentially less able to meet social distancing requirements while in parks during periods of high use. Cities in England and Wales can provide residents with access to green space that enables outdoor exercise and play during social distancing. Keeping public parks and gardens open, might require measures such as dedicated park times for different age groups or entry allocation systems that, combined with smartphone apps or drones, can monitor and manage the total number of people using the park.",

    "abstract": "Background The burden and impact of healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections is unknown. We aimed to examine the utility of rapid sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 combined with detailed epidemiological analysis to investigate healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections and to inform infection control measures. Methods We set up rapid viral sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from PCR-positive diagnostic samples using nanopore sequencing, enabling sample-to-sequence in less than 24 hours. We established a rapid review and reporting system with integration of genomic and epidemiological data to investigate suspected cases of healthcare-associated COVID-19. Results Between 13 March and 24 April 2020 we collected clinical data and samples from 5191 COVID-19 patients in the East of England. We sequenced 1000 samples, producing 747 complete viral genomes. We conducted combined epidemiological and genomic analysis of 299 patients at our hospital and identified 26 genomic clusters involving 114 patients. 66 cases (57.9%) had a strong epidemiological link and 15 cases (13.2%) had a plausible epidemiological link. These results were fed back clinical, infection control and hospital management teams, resulting in infection control interventions and informing patient safety reporting. Conclusions We established real-time genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in a UK hospital and demonstrated the benefit of combined genomic and epidemiological analysis for the investigation of healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections. This approach enabled us to detect cryptic transmission events and identify opportunities to target infection control interventions to reduce further healthcare-associated infections.",

    "abstract": "The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) spatial distribution in Italy is inhomogeneous, because of its ways of spreading from the initial hotspots. The impact of COVID-19 on mortality has been described at the regional level, while less is known about mortality in demographic subgroups within municipalities. We aimed to describe the excess mortality (EM) due to COVID-19 in the three most affected Italian regions, by estimating EM in subgroups defined by gender and age classes within each municipality from February 23 to March 31, 2020. EM varied widely among municipalities even within the same region; it was similar between genders for the [&ge;]75 age group, while in the other age groups it was higher in males. Thus, nearby municipalities may show a different mortality burden despite being under common regional health policies, possibly as a result of policies adopted both at the regional and at the municipality level.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a novel methodology for systematically processing the time series that report the number of positive, recovered and deceased cases from a viral epidemic, such as Covid-19. The main objective is to unveil the evolution of the number of real infected people, and consequently to predict the peak of the epidemic and subsequent evolution. For this purpose, an original nonlinear model relating the raw data with the time-varying geometric ratio of infected people is elaborated, and a Kalman Filter is used to estimate the involved state variables. A hypothetical simulated case is used to show the adequacy and limitations of the proposed method. Then, several countries, including China, South Korea, Italy, Spain, UK and the USA, are tested to illustrate its behavior when real-life data are processed. The results obtained clearly show the beneficial effect of the social distancing measures adopted worldwide, confirming that the Covid-19 epidemic peak is left behind in those countries where the outbreak started earlier, and anticipating when the peak will take place in the remaining countries.",

    "abstract": "Background. With its high prevalence of chronic non-degenerative diseases, it is suspected that in Mexico there is a high risk of fatal complications from COVID-19. The present study aims to estimate the risk factors for hospitalisation and death in the Mexican population infected by SARS-CoV-2. Methods and Findings. We used the publicly available data released by the Epidemiological Surveillance System for Viral Respiratory Diseases of the Mexican Ministry of Health (Secretaria de Salud, SS). All records of positive SARS-CoV-2 cases were included. Two multiple logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the association between the hospitalisation and mortality, with other covariables. Data on 10,544 individuals (57.68% men), with mean age 46.47 SD 15.62, were analysed. Men were about 1.54 times as likely to be hospitalized than women (p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.37-1.74); individuals aged 50-74 and >=74 years were more likely to be hospitalized than people from 25-49 years (OR 2.05, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.81-2.32, and OR 23.84, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 2.90-5.15, respectively). People with hypertension, obesity, and diabetes were more likely to be hospitalised than people without these morbidities (p<0.01). Men had more risk of death in comparison to women (OR=1.53, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.30-1.81) and individuals aged 50-74 and [&ge;]75 years were more likely to die than people from 25-49 years (OR 1.96, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.63-2.34, and OR 3.74, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 2.80-4.98, respectively). Hypertension, obesity, and diabetes presented in combination, provided a higher risk of dying in comparison to not having these diseases (OR=2.10; p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.50-2.93). Hospitalisation, intubation and pneumonia conferred a higher risk of dying (OR 5.02, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 3.88-6.50; OR 4.27, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 3.26-5.59, and OR=2.57; p<0.001, 95% C.I. 2.11-3.13, respectively). The main limitation of our study is the lack of information on mild (asymptomatic) or moderate cases of COVID-19. Conclusions. The present study points out that in Mexico, where an important proportion of the population develops two or more chronic conditions simultaneously, high mortality is a sever outcome for those infected by SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "The immediate call for translational research in the field of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, needs new and unexplored angles to support and contribute to this important worldwide health problem. The aim of this study is to better understand the pathogenic mechanisms underlying COVID-19, deciphering the carbohydrate-mediated interactions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We studied the carbohydrate-binding receptors that could be important for viral entry and for immune-modulatory responses, and we studied the interactions of the spike protein with the host lung microbiota. Exploring solid-phase immunoassays, we evaluated the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and a library of 12 different human carbohydrate-binding proteins (C-type lectins and Siglecs) involved in binding, triggering and modulation of innate and adaptive immune-responses. We revealed a specific binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the receptors DC-SIGN, MGL, Siglec-9 and Siglec-10 that are all expressed on myeloid immune cells. In addition, because the lung microbiota can promote or modulate viral infection, we studied the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and a library of Streptococcus pneumoniae capsular polysaccharides, as well as other bacterial glyco-conjugates. We show specific binding of the spike protein to different S. pneumoniae capsular polysaccharides (serotypes 19F and 23F but not to serotype 14). Moreover we demonstrated a specific binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the lipopolysaccharide from the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one of the leading cause of acute nosocomial infections and pneumonia. Interestingly, we identified rhamnosylated epitopes as one of the discriminating structures in lung microbiota to bind SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. In conclusion, we revealed novel ACE2-independent carbohydrate-mediated interactions with immune modulating lectins expressed on myeloid cells, as well as host lung microbiota glyco-conjugates. Our results identified new molecular pathways using host lectins and signalling, that may contribute to viral infection and subsequent immune exacerbation. Moreover we identified specific rhamnosylated epitopes in lung microbiota to bind SARS-CoV-2, providing a hypothetical link between the presence of specific lung microbiota and SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infections are rapidly spreading around the globe. The rapid development of therapies is of major importance. However, our lack of understanding of the molecular processes and host cell signaling events underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection hinder therapy development. We employed a SARS-CoV-2 infection system in permissible human cells to study signaling changes by phospho-proteomics. We identified viral protein phosphorylation and defined phosphorylation-driven host cell signaling changes upon infection. Growth factor receptor (GFR) signaling and downstream pathways were activated. Drug-protein network analyses revealed GFR signaling as key pathway targetable by approved drugs. Inhibition of GFR downstream signaling by five compounds prevented SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells, assessed by cytopathic effect, viral dsRNA production, and viral RNA release into the supernatant. This study describes host cell signaling events upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and reveals GFR signaling as central pathway essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication. It provides with novel strategies for COVID-19 treatment.",

    "abstract": "Testing for RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 requires careful handling of inherently labile RNA during sample collection, clinical processing, and molecular analysis. Tests must include fail-safe controls that affirmatively report the presence of intact RNA and demonstrate success of all steps of the assay. A result of \"no virus signal\" is insufficient for clinical interpretation: controls must also say \"The reaction worked as intended and would have found virus if present.\" Unfortunately, a widely used test specified by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) incorporates a control that does not perform as intended and claimed. Detecting SARS-CoV-2 with this assay requires both intact RNA and successful reverse transcription. The CDC-specified control does not require either of these, due to its inability to differentiate human genomic DNA from reverse-transcribed RNA. Patient DNA is copurified from nasopharyngeal swabs during clinically-approved RNA extraction and is sufficient to return an \"extraction control success\" signal using the CDC design. As such, this assay fails-unsafe: truly positive patient samples return a false-negative result of \"no virus detected, control succeeded\" following any of several readily-encountered mishaps. This problem affects tens-of-millions of patients worth of shipped assays, but many of these flawed reagents have not yet been used. There is an opportunity to improve this important diagnostic tool. As demonstrated here, a re-designed transcript-specific control correctly monitors sample collection, extraction, reverse transcription, and qPCR detection. This approach can be rapidly implemented and will help reduce truly positive patients from being incorrectly given the all-clear.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA widely-used COVID-19 diagnostic is mis-designed and generates false-negative results, dangerously confusing \"No\" with \"Dont know\" - but its fixable",

    "abstract": "Effective therapies are urgently needed for the SARS-CoV-2/COVID19 pandemic. We identified panels of fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from eight large phage-displayed Fab, scFv and VH libraries by panning against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein. One high affinity mAb, IgG1 ab1, specifically neutralized replication competent SARS-CoV-2 with exceptional potency as measured by two different assays. There was no enhancement of pseudovirus infection in cells expressing Fc{gamma} receptors at any concentration. It competed with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for binding to RBD suggesting a competitive mechanism of virus neutralization. IgG1 ab1 potently neutralized mouse ACE2 adapted SARS-CoV-2 in wild type BALB/c mice and native virus in hACE2 expressing transgenic mice. The ab1 sequence has relatively low number of somatic mutations indicating that ab1-like antibodies could be quickly elicited during natural SARS-CoV-2 infection or by RBD-based vaccines. IgG1 ab1 does not have developability liabilities, and thus has potential for therapy and prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The rapid identification (within 6 days) of potent mAbs shows the value of large antibody libraries for response to public health threats from emerging microbes.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing host transcriptional changes in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection will help delineate biological processes underlying viral pathogenesis. Comparison of expression profiles of lung cell lines A549 (infected with either SARS-CoV-2 (with ACE2 expression)) or Influenza A virus (IAV)) and Calu3 (infected with SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV) revealed upregulation of the antiviral interferon signaling in all three viral infections. However, perturbations in inflammatory, mitochondrial, and autophagy processes were specifically observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Validation of findings from cell line data revealed perturbations in autophagy and mitochondrial processes in the infected human nasopharyngeal samples. Specifically, downregulation of mTOR expression, mitochondrial ribosomal, mitochondrial complex I, and lysosome acidification genes were concurrently observed in both infected cell lines and human datasets. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection impedes autophagic flux by upregulating GSK3B in lung cell lines, or by downregulating autophagy genes, SNAP29 and lysosome acidification genes in human samples, contributing to increased viral replication. Therefore, drugs targeting lysosome acidification or autophagic flux could be tested as intervention strategies. Additionally, downregulation of MTFP1 (in cell lines) or SOCS6 (in human samples) results in hyperfused mitochondria and impede proper interferon response. Coexpression networks analysis identifies correlated clusters of genes annotated to inflammation and mitochondrial processes that are misregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Finally, comparison of age stratified human gene expression data revealed impaired upregulation of chemokines, interferon stimulated and tripartite motif genes that are critical for antiviral signaling. Together, this analysis has revealed specific aspects of autophagic and mitochondrial function that are uniquely perturbed in SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "Bats have been shown to serve as reservoir host of various viral agents including coronaviruses. They have also been associated with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. This has made them an all important agent for CoV evolution and transmission. Our objective in this study was to investigate the dispersal, phylogenomics and evolution of betacoronavirus ({beta}CoV) among African bats. We retrieved sequence data from established databases such as GenBank and Virus Pathogen Resource, covering the partial RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene of Bat coronaviruses from eight African, three Asian, five European, two South American countries and Australia. We analyzed for Phylogeographic information relating to genetic diversity and evolutionary dynamics. Our study revealed that majority of the African strains fell within Norbecovirus subgenera, with an Evolutionary rate of 1.301 x 10-3, HPD (1.064 x 10-3 - 1.434 x 10-3) subs/site/year. The African strains diversified into three main subgenera, Norbecovirus, Hibecovirus and Marbecovirus. The time to most common recent ancestor for Norbecovirus strains was 1968, and 2010, for the African Marbecovirus strains. There was evidence of inter species transmission of Norbecovirus among bats in Cameroun and DRC. Phlylogeography showed that there were inter-continental spread of Bt-CoV from Europe, China and Hong Kong into Central and Southern Africa, highlighting the possibility of long distance transmission. Our study has elucidated the possible evolutionary origins of {beta}CoV among African bats, we therefore advocate for broader studies of whole genome sequences of BtCoV to further understand the drivers for their emergence and zoonotic spillovers into human population.",

    "abstract": "(1) BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19) is associated with adverse outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of the study was to characterize the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) functional networks with a focus on CVD.;\n\n(2) MethodsUsing the network medicine approach and publicly available datasets, we investigated ACE2 tissue expression and described ACE2 interaction networks which could be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the heart, lungs and nervous system. We compared them with changes in ACE-2 networks following SARS-CoV-2 infection by analyzing public data of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). This analysis was performed using the NERI algorithm, which integrates protein-protein interaction with co-expression networks. We also performed miRNA-target predictions to identify which ones regulate ACE2-related networks and could play a role in the COVID19 outcome. Finally, we performed enrichment analysis for identifying the main COVID-19 risk groups.\n\n(3) ResultsWe found similar ACE2 expression confidence levels in respiratory and cardiovascular systems, supporting that heart tissue is a potential target of SARS-CoV-2. Analysis of ACE2 interaction networks in infected hiPSC-CMs identified multiple hub genes with corrupted signalling which can be responsible for cardiovascular symptoms. The most affected genes were EGFR, FN1, TP53, HSP90AA1, and APP, while the most affected interactions were associated with MAST2 and CALM1. Enrichment analysis revealed multiple diseases associated with the interaction networks of ACE2, especially cancerous diseases, obesity, hypertensive disease, Alzheimers disease, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart failure. Among affected ACE2-network components connected with SARS-Cov-2 interactome, we identified AGT, CAT, DPP4, CCL2, TFRC and CAV1, associated with cardiovascular risk factors. We described for the first time miRNAs which were common regulators of ACE2 networks and virus-related proteins in all analyzed datasets. The top miRNAs were miR-27a-3p, miR-26b-5p, miR-10b-5p, miR-302c-5p, hsa-miR-587, hsa-miR-1305, hsa-miR-200b-3p, hsa-miR-124-3p, and hsa-miR-16-5p.;\n\n(4) ConclusionOur study provides a complete mechanistic framework for investigating the ACE2 network which was validated by expression data. This framework predicted risk groups, including the established ones, thus providing reliable novel information regarding the complexity of signalling pathways affected by SARS-CoV-2. It also identified miR which could be used in personalized diagnosis in COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has evolved into a worldwide pandemic. Early data suggest that the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 appear to be higher among patients with underlying cardiovascular risk factors. Despite the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, in cardiomyocytes, there has been no conclusive evidence of direct viral infection although the presence of inflammation and viral genome within the hearts of COVID-19 patients have been reported. Here we transduced A549 lung epithelial cells with lentivirus overexpressing selected genes of the SARS-CoV-2. We then isolated extracellular vesicles (EVs) from the supernatant of A549 cells and detected the presence of viral RNA within the purified EVs. Importantly, we observed that human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) were able to actively uptake these EVs and viral genes were subsequently detected in the cardiomyocytes. Accordingly, uptake of EVs containing viral genes led to an upregulation of inflammation-related genes in hiPSC-CMs. Thus, our findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 RNA-containing EVs represent an indirect route of viral RNA entry into cardiomyocytes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic is causing a major global health and socio-economic burden, instigating the mobilisation of resources into the development of control tools, such as diagnostics and vaccines. The poor performance of some diagnostic serological tools has emphasised the need for up to date immune-informatic analyses to inform the selection of viable targets for further study. This requires the integration and analysis of genetic and immunological data for SARS-CoV-2 and its homology with other human coronavirus species to understand cross-reactivity.\n\nMethodsWe have developed an online tool for SARS-CoV-2 research, which combines an extensive epitope mapping and prediction meta-analysis, with an updated variant database (55,944 non-synonymous mutations) based on 16,087 whole genome sequences, and an analysis of human coronavirus homology. To demonstrate its utility, we present an integrated analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins, which are candidate vaccine and serological diagnostic targets.\n\nResultsOur analysis reveals that the nucleocapsid protein in its native form appears to be a sub-optimal target for use in serological diagnostic platforms. Whilst, a further analysis suggests that orf3a proteins may be a suitable alternative target for diagnostic assays.\n\nConclusionsThe tool can be accessed online (http://genomics.lshtm.ac.uk/immuno) and will serve as a useful tool for biological discovery in the fight against SARS-CoV-2. Further, it may be adapted to inform on biological targets in future outbreaks, including new human coronaviruses that spill over from animal hosts.",

    "abstract": "Importance: The Covid-19 pandemic has been marked by considerable heterogeneity in outbreaks across the United States. Local factors that may be associated with variation in SARS-CoV-2 transmission have not been well studied. Objective: To examine the association of county-level factors with variation in the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number over time. Design: Observational study Setting: 211 counties in 46 states and the District of Columbia between February 25, 2020 and April 23, 2020. Participants: Residents within the counties (55% of the US population) Exposures: Social distancing as measured by percent change in visits to non-essential businesses, population density, lagged daily wet bulb temperatures. Main Outcomes and Measures: The instantaneous reproduction number (Rt) which is the estimated number of cases generated by one case at a given time during the pandemic. Results: Median case incidence was 1185 cases and fatality rate was 43.7 deaths per 100,000 people for the top decile of 21 counties, nearly ten times the incidence and fatality rate in the lowest density quartile. Average Rt in the first two weeks was 5.7 (SD 2.5) in the top decile, compared to 3.1 (SD 1.2) in the lowest quartile. In multivariable analysis, a 50% decrease in visits to non-essential businesses was associated with a 57% decrease in Rt (95% confidence interval, 56% to 58%). Cumulative temperature effects over 4 to 10 days prior to case incidence were nonlinear; relative Rt decreased as temperatures warmed above 32F to 53F, which was the point of minimum Rt, then increased between 53F and 66F, at which point Rt began to decrease. At 55F, and with a 70% reduction in visits to non-essential business, 96% of counties were estimated to fall below a threshold Rt of 1.0, including 86% of counties among the top density decile and 98% of counties in the lowest density quartile. Conclusions and Relevance: Social distancing, lower population density, and temperate weather change were associated with a decreased SARS-Co-V-2 Rt in counties across the United States. These relationships can inform selective public policy planning in communities during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "A person clinically diagnosed with COVID 19 can infect others for several days before and after the onset of symptoms. At the epidemiological level, this information on how infectious someone is lies embedded implicitly in the serial interval data. Other clinical indicators of infectiousness based on the temporal kinetics of the viral shedding from the nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum show the former decaying weeks sooner than the latter. In this work, we attempt to provide a better quantitative estimate for the temporal infectiousness profile using serial interval data from a combined 1251 individuals reported in the literature. We show that the infectiousness profile which we calculate correlates well with the viral shedding kinetics from nasopharyngeal swabs (rho=0.97, p=0.00) and culturability (rho=0.83, p=0.01). The profile suggests that a 68.4% (95% CI: 67.0-69.7%) of the infections are caused by infections before the symptoms appear, which is a much stronger pre-symptomatic influence than what was predicted in the literature 44% (95% CI: 25-69%) using serial data from 77 individuals.",

University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHB) in Birmingham, UK Participants. Patients with confirmed SARS CoV 2 infection requiring admission to UHB between 10th March 2020 and 17th April 2020 Exposure. Ethnicity Main outcome measures. Standardised Admission Ratio (SAR) and Standardised Mortality Ratio (SMR) for each ethnicity was calculated using observed sex specific age distributions of COVID19 admissions and deaths and 2011 census data for Birmingham/Solihull. Hazard Ratio (aHR) for mortality was estimated for each ethnic group with white population as reference group, using Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for age, sex, social deprivation and co-morbidities, and propensity score matching. Results. 2217 patients admitted to UHB with a proven diagnosis of COVID19 were included. 58.2% were male, 69.5% White and the majority (80.2%) had co morbidities. 18.5% were of South Asian ethnicity, and these patients were more likely to be younger (median age 61 years vs.77 years), have no co morbidities (27.8% vs. 16.6%) but a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (48.0% vs 28.2%) than White patients. SAR and SMR suggested more admissions and deaths in South Asian patients than would be predicted. South Asian patients were also more likely to present with severe disease despite no delay in presentation since symptom onset. South Asian ethnicity was associated with an increased risk of death; both by Cox regression (Hazard Ratio 1.66 (95%CI 1.32 to 2.10)) after adjusting for age, sex, deprivation and comorbidities and by propensity score matching, (Hazard ratio 1.68 (1.33 to 2.13), using the same factors but categorising ethnicity into South Asian or not. Conclusions. Current evidence suggests those of South Asian ethnicity may be at risk of worse COVID19 outcomes, further studies need to establish the underlying mechanistic pathways.",

    "abstract": "Background Establishing who is at risk from a novel rapidly arising cause of death, and why, requires a new approach to epidemiological research with very large datasets and timely data. Working on behalf of NHS England we therefore set out to deliver a secure and pseudonymised analytics platform inside the data centre of a major primary care electronic health records vendor establishing coverage across detailed primary care records for a substantial proportion of all patients in England. The following results are preliminary. Data sources Primary care electronic health records managed by the electronic health record vendor TPP, pseudonymously linked to patient-level data from the COVID-19 Patient Notification System (CPNS) for death of hospital inpatients with confirmed COVID-19, using the new OpenSAFELY platform. Population 17,425,445 adults. Time period 1st Feb 2020 to 25th April 2020. Primary outcome Death in hospital among people with confirmed COVID-19. Methods Cohort study analysed by Cox-regression to generate hazard ratios: age and sex adjusted, and multiply adjusted for co-variates selected prospectively on the basis of clinical interest and prior findings. Results There were 5683 deaths attributed to COVID-19. In summary after full adjustment, death from COVID-19 was strongly associated with: being male (hazard ratio 1.99, 95%CI 1.88-2.10); older age and deprivation (both with a strong gradient); uncontrolled diabetes (HR 2.36 95% CI 2.18-2.56); severe asthma (HR 1.25 CI 1.08-1.44); and various other prior medical conditions. Compared to people with ethnicity recorded as white, black people were at higher risk of death, with only partial attenuation in hazard ratios from the fully adjusted model (age-sex adjusted HR 2.17 95% CI 1.84-2.57; fully adjusted HR 1.71 95% CI 1.44-2.02); with similar findings for Asian people (age-sex adjusted HR 1.95 95% CI 1.73-2.18; fully adjusted HR 1.62 95% CI 1.43-1.82). Conclusions We have quantified a range of clinical risk factors for death from COVID-19, some of which were not previously well characterised, in the largest cohort study conducted by any country to date. People from Asian and black groups are at markedly increased risk of in-hospital death from COVID-19, and contrary to some prior speculation this is only partially attributable to pre-existing clinical risk factors or deprivation; further research into the drivers of this association is therefore urgently required. Deprivation is also a major risk factor with, again, little of the excess risk explained by co-morbidity or other risk factors. The findings for clinical risk factors are concordant with policies in the UK for protecting those at highest risk. Our OpenSAFELY platform is rapidly adding further NHS patients' records; we will update and extend these results regularly.

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has globally strained medical resources and caused significant mortality for severely and critically ill patients. However, the availability of validated nomograms and the machine-learning model to predict severity risk and triage of affected patients is limited. OBJECTIVE To develop and validate nomograms and machine-learning models for severity risk assessment and triage for COVID-19 patients at hospital admission. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective cohort of 299 consecutively hospitalized COVID-19 patients at The Central Hospital of Wuhan, China, from December 23, 2019, to February 13, 2020, was used to train and validate the models. Six cohorts with 426 patients from eight centers in China, Italy, and Belgium, from February 20, 2020, to March 21, 2020, were used to prospectively validate the models. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES The main outcome was the onset of severe or critical illness during hospitalization. Model performances were quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. RESULTS Of the 299 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the retrospective cohort, the median age was 50 years ((interquartile range, 35.5-63.0; range, 20-94 years) and 137 (45.8%) were men. Of the 426 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the prospective cohorts, the median age was 62.0 years ((interquartile range, 50.0-72.0; range, 19-94 years) and 236 (55.4%) were men. The model was prospectively validated on six cohorts yielding AUCs ranging from 0.816 to 0.976, with accuracies ranging from 70.8% to 93.8%, sensitivities ranging from 83.7% to 100%, and specificities ranging from 41.0% to 95.7%. The cut-off values of the low, medium, and high-risk probabilities were 0.072 and 0.244. The developed online calculators can be found at www.predict19risk.ai. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE The machine learning models, nomograms, and online calculators might be useful for the prediction of onset of severe and critical illness among COVID-19 patients and triage at hospital admission. Further prospective research and clinical feedback are necessary to evaluate the clinical usefulness of this model and to determine whether these models can help optimize medical resources and reduce mortality rates compared with current clinical practices.",

    "abstract": "We report a longitudinal analysis of the immune response associated with a fatal case of COVID-19. This patient exhibited a rapid evolution towards multiorgan failure. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in multiple nasopharyngeal, blood, and pleural samples, despite antiviral and immunomodulator treatment. Clinical evolution in the blood was marked by an increase (2-3 fold) in differentiated effector T cells expressing exhaustion (PD-1) and senescence (CD57) markers, an expansion of antibody-secreting cells, a 15-fold increase in {gamma}{delta} T-cell and proliferating NK-cell populations, and the total disappearance of monocytes, suggesting lung trafficking. In the serum, waves of a proinflammatory cytokine storm, Th1 and Th2 activation, and markers of T-cell exhaustion, apoptosis, cell cytotoxicity, and endothelial activation were observed until the fatal outcome. This case underscores the need for well-designed studies to investigate complementary approaches to control viral replication, the source of the hyperinflammatory status, and immunomodulation to target the pathophysiological response.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Humans and viruses have co-evolved for millennia resulting in a complex host genetic architecture. Understanding the genetic mechanisms of immune response to viral infection provides insight into disease etiology and informs public health interventions. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive study including genome-wide and transcriptome-wide association analyses to identify genetic loci associated with immunoglobulin G antibody response to 28 antigens for 16 viruses using serological data from 7924 European ancestry participants in the UK Biobank cohort. Results: Signals in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region dominated the landscape of viral antibody response, with 40 independent loci and 14 independent classical alleles, 7 of which exhibited pleiotropic effects across viral families. We identified specific amino acid (AA) residues that are associated with seroreactivity, the strongest associations presented in a range of AA positions within DR{beta}1 at positions 11, 13, 71, and 74 for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV), Human Herpes virus 7, (HHV7) and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV). Genome-wide association analyses discovered 7 novel genetic loci associated with viral antibody response (P<5.0x10-8), including FUT2 (19q13.33) for human polyomavirus BK (BKV), STING1 (5q31.2) for MCV, as well as CXCR5 (11q23.3) and TBKBP1 (17q21.32) for human herpesvirus 7. Transcriptome-wide association analyses identified 114 genes associated with response to viral infection, 12 outside of the HLA region, including ECSCR: P=5.0x10-15 (MCV), NTN5: P=1.1x10-9 (BKV), and P2RY13: P=1.1x10-8 (Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen). We also demonstrated pleiotropy between viral response genes and complex diseases, such as C4A expression in varicella zoster virus and schizophrenia. Conclusions: Our study confirms the importance of the HLA region in host response to viral infection and elucidates novel genetic determinants beyond the HLA that contribute to host-virus interaction.",

    "abstract": "Coronaviruses are prone to emergence into new host species most recently evidenced by SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Small animal models that recapitulate SARS-CoV-2 disease are desperately needed to rapidly evaluate medical countermeasures (MCMs). SARS-CoV-2 cannot infect wildtype laboratory mice due to inefficient interactions between the viral spike (S) protein and the murine ortholog of the human receptor, ACE2. We used reverse genetics to remodel the S and mACE2 binding interface resulting in a recombinant virus (SARS-CoV-2 MA) that could utilize mACE2 for entry. SARS-CoV-2 MA replicated in both the upper and lower airways of both young adult and aged BALB/c mice. Importantly, disease was more severe in aged mice, and showed more clinically relevant phenotypes than those seen in hACE2 transgenic mice. We then demonstrated the utility of this model through vaccine challenge studies in immune competent mice with native expression of mACE2. Lastly, we show that clinical candidate interferon (IFN) lambda-1a can potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human airway epithelial cells in vitro, and both prophylactic and therapeutic administration diminished replication in mice. Our mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 model demonstrates age-related disease pathogenesis and supports the clinical use of IFN lambda-1a treatment in human COVID-19 infections.",

    "abstract": "Viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2, which is the virus responsible of the Covid-19 pandemic, were sequenced in several Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) seized in the Guangdong and Guangxi provinces of China between 2017 and 20191-3. These viruses belong to two lineages: one from Guangdong (GD/P) and the other from Guangxi (GX/P). The GD/P viruses are particularly intriguing as the amino-acid sequence of the receptor binding domain of the spike protein is very similar to that of the human SARS-CoV-2 virus (97.4%)2. This characteristic suggests that GD/P viruses are capable of binding human ACE2 receptor and may therefore be able to mediate infection of human cells. Whereas all six GX/P genomes were deposited as annotated sequences in GenBank, none of the two GD/P genomes assembled in previous studies2,3 are currently available. To overcome this absence, I assembled these genomes from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data available for SARS-CoV-2-like viruses detected in five captive pangolins from Guangdong. I found the genome assemblies of GD/P virus of poor quality, having high levels of missing data. Additionally, unexpected reads in the Illumina sequencing data were identified. The GD/P2S dataset2 contains reads that are identical to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting either the coexistence of two SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the same pangolin or contamination by the human virus. In the four other GD/P datasets1 many mitochondrial reads from pangolin were identified, as well as from three other species, namely, human, mouse and tiger. Importantly, I only identified three polymorphic nucleotide sites between the five GD/P sequences. Such low levels of polymorphism may reasonably be accounted for by sequencing errors alone, thus raising the possibility that the five pangolins seized in Guangdong in March 2019 were infected by the same virus strain, most probably during their captivity.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that originated from Wuhan, China, in December 2019 has impacted public health, society and economy and the daily lives of billions of people in an unprecedented manner. There are currently no specific registered antiviral drugs to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections. Therefore, drug repurposing would be the fastest route to provide at least a temporary solution while better, more specific drugs are being developed. Here we demonstrate that the antiparasitic drug suramin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, protecting Vero E6 cells with an EC50 of [~]20 {micro}M, which is well below the maximum attainable level in human serum. Suramin also decreased the viral load by 2-3 logs when Vero E6 cells or cells of a human lung epithelial cell line (Calu-3) were treated. Time of addition and plaque reduction assays showed that suramin acts on early steps of the replication cycle, possibly preventing entry of the virus. In a primary human airway epithelial cell culture model, suramin also inhibited the progression of infection. The results of our preclinical study warrant further investigation and suggest it is worth evaluating whether suramin provides any benefit for COVID-19 patients, which obviously requires well-designed, properly controlled randomized clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "The recently ermerging disease COVID-19 is caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus first detected in the city of Wuhan, China. From there it has been rapidly spreading inside and outside China. With initial death rates around 4%, COVID-19 patients at longer distances from Wuhan showed reduced mortality as was previously observed for the SARS coronavirus. However, the new coronavirus spreads more strongly, as it sheds long before onset of symptoms or may be transmitted by people without symptoms. Rapid development of a protective vaccine against COVID-19 is therefore of paramount importance. Here we demonstrate that recombinantly expressed receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein homologous to SARS binds to ACE2, the viral receptor. Higly repetitive display of RBD on immunologically optimized virus-like particles derived from cucumber mosaic virus resulted in a vaccine candidate (RBD-CuMVTT) that induced high levels of specific antibodies in mice which were able to block binding of spike protein to ACE2 and potently neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 can lead to acute respiratory syndrome in patients, which can be due to dysregulated immune signaling. We analyze the distribution of CpG dinucleotides, a pathogen-associated molecular pattern, in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We find that CpG relative abundance, which we characterize by an adequate force parameter taking into account statistical constraints acting on the genome at the nucleotidic and amino-acid levels is, on the overall, low compared to other pathogenic betacoronaviruses. However, the CpG force widely fluctuates along the genome, with particularly low value, comparable to the circulating seasonal HKU1, in the Spike protein (S) coding region and high value, comparable to SARS and MERS, in the highly expressed nucleocapside (N) coding regions, whose transcripts are relatively abundant in the cytoplasm of infected cells and present in the 3UTRs of all subgenomic RNA. This dual nature of CpG content could confer to SARS-CoV-2 the ability to avoid triggering pattern recognition receptors upon entry, while eliciting a stronger response during replication. We then investigate the evolution of synonymous mutations since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a model of the viral gene evolution under human host pressure, we find that synonymous mutations seem driven, in the N protein coding region, both by the viral codon bias and by the high value of the CpG content, leading to a loss in CpG. Sequence motifs preceding these CpG-loss-associated loci match recently identified binding patterns of the Zinc finger Anti-viral Protein.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEpidemiological, virological and pathogenetic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection are under evaluation. A better understanding of the pathophysiology associated with COVID-19 is crucial to improve treatment modalities and to develop effective prevention strategies. Transcriptomic and proteomic data on the host response against SARS-CoV-2 still have anecdotic character; currently available data from other coronavirus infections are therefore a key source of information.\n\nMethodsWe investigated selected molecular aspects of three human coronavirus (HCoV) infections, namely SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, through a network based-approach. A functional analysis of HCoV-host interactome was carried out in order to provide a theoretic host-pathogen interaction model for HCoV infections and in order to translate the results in prediction for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.\n\nThe 3D model of S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was compared to the structure of the corresponding SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV S-glycoprotein. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E and the host interactome were inferred through published protein-protein interactions (PPI) as well as gene co-expression, triggered by HCoV S-glycoprotein in host cells.\n\nResultsAlthough the amino acid sequences of the S-glycoprotein were found to be different between the various HCoV, the structures showed high similarity, but the best 3D structural overlap shared by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, consistent with the shared ACE2 predicted receptor. The host interactome, linked to the S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, mainly highlighted innate immunity pathway components, such as Toll Like receptors, cytokines and chemokines.\n\nConclusionsIn this paper, we developed a network-based model with the aim to define molecular aspects of pathogenic phenotypes in HCoV infections. The resulting pattern may facilitate the process of structure-guided pharmaceutical and diagnostic research with the prospect to identify potential new biological targets.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the ongoing Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic 1,2. In order to understand SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity and antigenic potential, and to develop diagnostic and therapeutic tools, it is essential to portray the full repertoire of its expressed proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 coding capacity map is currently based on computational predictions and relies on homology to other coronaviruses. Since coronaviruses differ in their protein array, especially in the variety of accessory proteins, it is crucial to characterize the specific collection of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in an unbiased and open-ended manner. Utilizing a suite of ribosome profiling techniques 3-8, we present a high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 coding regions, allowing us to accurately quantify the expression of canonical viral open reading frames (ORF)s and to identify 23 novel unannotated viral translated ORFs. These ORFs include upstream ORFs (uORFs) that are likely playing a regulatory role, several in-frame internal ORFs lying within existing ORFs, resulting in N-terminally truncated products, as well as internal out-of-frame ORFs, which generate novel polypeptides. We further show that viral mRNAs are not translated more efficiently than host mRNAs; rather, virus translation dominates host translation due to high levels of viral transcripts. Overall, our work reveals the full coding capacity of SARS-CoV-2 genome, providing a rich resource, which will form the basis of future functional studies and diagnostic efforts.",

    "abstract": "The technique RT-qPCR for viral RNA detection is the current worldwide strategy used for early detection of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. RNA extraction is a key pre-analytical step in RT-qPCR, often achieved using commercial kits. However, the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic is causing disruptions to the global supply chains used by many diagnostic laboratories to procure the commercial kits required for RNA extraction. Shortage in these essential reagents is even more acute in developing countries with no means to produce kits locally. We sought to find an alternative procedure to replace commercial kits using common reagents found in molecular biology laboratories. Here we report a method for RNA extraction that takes about 40 min to complete ten samples, and is not more laborious than current commercial RNA extraction kits. We demonstrate that this method can be used to process nasopharyngeal swab samples and yields RT-qPCR results comparable to those obtained with commercial kits. Most importantly, this procedure can be easily implemented in any molecular diagnostic laboratory. Frequent testing is crucial for individual patient management as well as for public health decision making in this pandemic. Implementation of this method could maintain crucial testing going despite commercial kit shortages.",

To get a grip on this outbreak, specific preventive and therapeutic interventions are urgently needed. It must be said that, until now, there are no existing vaccines for coronaviruses. To promptly and rapidly respond to pandemic events, the application of in silico trials can be used for designing and testing medicines against SARS-CoV-2 and speed-up the vaccine discovery pipeline, predicting any therapeutic failure and minimizing undesired effects. Here, we present an in silico platform that showed to be in very good agreement with the latest literature in predicting SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and related immune system host response. Moreover, it has been used to predict the outcome of one of the latest suggested approach to design an effective vaccine, based on monoclonal antibody. Universal Immune System Simulator (UISS) in silico platform is potentially ready to be used as an in silico trial platform to predict the outcome of vaccination strategy against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The rapid, sensitive and specific diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by fast and unambiguous testing is widely recognized to be critical in responding to the ongoing outbreak. Since the current testing capacity of RT-PCR-based methods is being challenged due to the extraordinary demand of supplies, such as RNA extraction kits and PCR reagents worldwide, alternative and/or complementary testing assays should be developed. Here, we exploit the potential of mass spectrometry technology combined with machine learning algorithms as an alternative fast tool for SARS-CoV-2 detection from nasopharyngeal swabs samples. According to our preliminary results, mass spectrometry-based methods combined with multivariate analysis showed an interesting potential as a complementary diagnostic tool and further steps should be focused on sample preparation protocols and the improvement of the technology applied.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has tragically burdened individuals and institutions around the world. There are currently no approved drugs or vaccines for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Enhanced understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis is critical for the development of therapeutics. To reveal insight into viral replication, cell tropism, and host-viral interactions of SARS-CoV-2 we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of experimentally infected human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) in air-liquid interface cultures over a time-course. This revealed novel polyadenylated viral transcripts and highlighted ciliated cells as a major target of infection, which we confirmed by electron microscopy. Over the course of infection, cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2 expands to other epithelial cell types including basal and club cells. Infection induces cell-intrinsic expression of type I and type III IFNs and IL6 but not IL1. This results in expression of interferon-stimulated genes in both infected and bystander cells. We observe similar gene expression changes from a COVID-19 patient ex vivo. In addition, we developed a new computational method termed CONditional DENSity Embedding (CONDENSE) to characterize and compare temporal gene dynamics in response to infection, which revealed genes relating to endothelin, angiogenesis, interferon, and inflammation-causing signaling pathways. In this study, we conducted an in-depth analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HBECs and a COVID-19 patient and revealed genes, cell types, and cell state changes associated with infection.",

    "abstract": "Background The mortality impact of COVID-19 has thus far been described in terms of crude death counts. We aimed to calibrate the scale of the modelled mortality impact of COVID-19 using age-standardised mortality rates and life expectancy contribution against other, socially-determined, causes of death in order to inform governments and the public. Methods We compared mortality attributable to suicide, drug poisoning and socioeconomic inequality with estimates of mortality from an infectious disease model of COVID-19. We calculated age-standardised mortality rates and life expectancy contributions for the UK and its constituent nations. Results Mortality from a fully unmitigated COVID-19 pandemic is estimated to be responsible for a negative life expectancy contribution of -5.96 years for the UK. This is reduced to -0.33 years in the fully mitigated scenario. The equivalent annual life expectancy contributions of suicide, drug poisoning and socioeconomic inequality-related deaths are -0.25, -0.20 and -3.51 years respectively. The negative impact of fully unmitigated COVID-19 on life expectancy is therefore equivalent to 24 years of suicide deaths, 30 years of drug poisoning deaths, and 1.7 years of inequality-related deaths for the UK. Conclusion Fully mitigating COVID-19 is estimated to prevent a loss of 5.63 years of life expectancy for the UK. Over 10 years there is a greater negative life expectancy contribution from inequality than around six unmitigated COVID-19 pandemics. To achieve long-term population health improvements it is therefore important to take this opportunity to introduce post-pandemic economic policies to build back better.",

    "abstract": "Background: Recent epidemiological evidence has demonstrated a higher rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths among minorities. This pattern of race-ethnic disparities emerging throughout the United States raises the question of what social factors may influence spread of a highly transmissible novel coronavirus. The purpose of this study is to describe race-ethnic and socioeconomic disparities associated with COVID-19 in patients in our community in Orange County, California and understand the role of individual-level factors, neighborhood-level factors, and access to care on outcomes. Methods: This is a case-series of COVID-19 patients from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) across six-weeks between 3/12/2020 and 4/22/2020. Note, California's shelter-in-place order began on 3/19/2020. Individual-level factors included race-ethnicity status were recorded. Neighborhood-level factors from census tracts included median household income, mean household size, proportion without a college degree, proportion working from home, and proportion without health insurance were also recorded. Results: A total of 210-patients tested were COVID-19 positive, of which 73.3% (154/210) resided in Orange County. Hispanic/Latinx patients residing in census tracts below the median income demonstrated exponential growth (rate = 55.9%, R2 = 0.9742) during the study period. In addition, there was a significant difference for both race-ethnic (p < 0.001) and income bracket (p = 0.001) distributions prior to and after California's shelter-in-place. In addition, the percentage of individuals residing in neighborhoods with denser households (p = 0.046), lower levels of college graduation (p < 0.001), health insurance coverage (p = 0.01), and ability to work from home (p < 0.001) significantly increased over the same timeframe. Conclusions and Relevance: Our study examines the race-ethnic disparities in Orange County, CA, and highlights vulnerable populations that are at increased risk for contracting COVID-19. Our descriptive case series illustrates that we also need to consider socioeconomic factors, which ultimately set the stage for biological and social disparities.",

    "abstract": "Background: The novel human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has claimed more than 240,000 lives worldwide, causing tremendous public health, social, and economic damages. While the risk factors of COVID-19 are still under investigation, environmental factors, such as urban air pollution, may play an important role in increasing population susceptibility to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional nationwide study using zero-inflated negative binomial models to estimate the association between long-term (2010-2016) county-level exposures to NO2, PM2.5 and O3 and county-level COVID-19 case-fatality and mortality rates in the US. We used both single and multipollutant models and controlled for spatial trends and a comprehensive set of potential confounders, including state-level test positive rate, county-level healthcare capacity, phase-of-epidemic, population mobility, sociodemographic, socioeconomic status, behavior risk factors, and meteorological factors. Results: 1,027,799 COVID-19 cases and 58,489 deaths were reported in 3,122 US counties from January 22, 2020 to April 29, 2020, with an overall observed case-fatality rate of 5.8%. Spatial variations were observed for both COVID-19 death outcomes and long-term ambient air pollutant levels. County-level average NO2 concentrations were positively associated with both COVID-19 case-fatality rate and mortality rate in single-, bi-, and tri-pollutant models (p-values<0.05). Per inter-quartile range (IQR) increase in NO2 (4.6 ppb), COVID-19 case-fatality rate and mortality rate were associated with an increase of 7.1% (95% CI 1.2% to 13.4%) and 11.2% (95% CI 3.4% to 19.5%), respectively. We did not observe significant associations between long-term exposures to PM2.5 or O3 and COVID-19 death outcomes (p-values>0.05), although per IQR increase in PM2.5 (3.4 ug/m3) was marginally associated with 10.8% (95% CI: -1.1% to 24.1%) increase in COVID-19 mortality rate. Discussions and Conclusions: Long-term exposure to NO2, which largely arises from urban combustion sources such as traffic, may enhance susceptibility to severe COVID-19 outcomes, independent of long-term PM2.5 and O3 exposure. The results support targeted public health actions to protect residents from COVID-19 in heavily polluted regions with historically high NO2 levels. Moreover, continuation of current efforts to lower traffic emissions and ambient air pollution levels may be an important component of reducing population-level risk of COVID-19 deaths.",

    "abstract": "In March and April 2020, control measures enforcing social distancing and restricting individual movement and contact were adopted across the United States in an effort to slow the spread and growth of COVID-19. However, a number of states have now begun to ease these restrictions. Here, we evaluate the effects of loosening stay-at-home orders on COVID-19 incidence and related outcomes. We use a metapopulation model applied at county resolution to simulate the spread and growth of COVID-19 incidence in the United States. We calibrate the model against county-level daily case and death data collected from February 21, 2020 to May 2, 2020, and project the outbreak in 3,142 US counties for 6 weeks into the future. Projections for daily reported cases, daily new infections (both reported and unreported), new and cumulative hospital bed demand, ICU bed and ventilator demand, as well as daily mortality, are generated. We observe a rebound in COVID-19 incidence and deaths beginning in late May, approximately 2 to 4 weeks after states begin to reopen. Importantly, the lag between infection acquisition and case confirmation, coupled with insufficient broader testing and contact tracing, will mask any rebound and exponential growth of the COVID-19 until it is well underway.",

    "abstract": "Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption across cancer pathways for diagnosis and treatment. In England, 32% of colorectal cancer (CRC) is diagnosed via urgent symptomatic referral from primary care, the \"2-week-wait\" (2WW) pathway. Access to routine endoscopy is likely to be a critical bottleneck causing delays in CRC management due to chronic limitation in capacity, acute competition for physician time, and safety concerns. Methods: We used age-specific, stage-specific 10 year CRC survival for England 2007-2017 and 2WW CRC cases volumes. We used per-day hazard ratios of CRC survival generated from observational studies of CRC diagnosis-to-treatment interval to model the effect of different durations of per-patient delay. We utilised data from a large London observational study of faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) in symptomatic patients to model FIT-triage to mitigate delay to colonoscopy. Findings: Modest delays result in significant reduction in survival from CRC with a 4-month delay resulting across age groups in [&ge;]20% reduction in survival in Stage 3 disease and in total over a year, 1,419 attributable deaths across the 11,266 CRC patients diagnosed via the 2WW pathway. FIT triage of >10 ug Hb/g would salvage 1,292/1,419 of the attributable deaths and reduce colonoscopy requirements by >80%. Diagnostic colonoscopy offers net survival in all age groups, providing nosocomial COVID-19 infection rates are kept low (<2.5%). Interpretation To avoid significant numbers of avoidable deaths from CRC, normal diagnostic and surgical throughput must be maintained. An accrued backlog of cases will present to primary care following release of lockdown, supranormal endoscopy capacity will be required to manage this without undue delays. FIT-triage of symptomatic cases provides a rational approach by which to avoid patient delay and mitigate pressure on capacity in endoscopy. This would also reduce exposure to nosocomial COVID-19 infection, relevant in particular to older patient groups.

Recently, the advent of deep learning in medical diagnosis has been well proven. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can be used to detect the COVID-19 infection imaging features in a chest CT scan. We introduce ai-corona, a radiologist-assistant deep learning framework for COVID-19 infection diagnosis using the chest CT scans. Method: Our dataset comprises 2121 cases of axial spiral chest CT scans in three classes; COVID-19 abnormal, non COVID-19 abnormal, and normal, from which 1764 cases were used for training and 357 cases for validation. The training set was annotated using the reports of two experienced radiologists. The COVID-19 abnormal class validation set was annotated using the general consensus of a collective of criteria that indicate COVID-19 infection. Moreover, the validation sets for the non COVID-19 abnormal and the normal classes were annotated by a different experienced radiologist. ai-corona constitutes a CNN-based feature extractor conjoined with an average pooling and a fully-connected layer to classify a given chest CT scan into the three aforementioned classes. Results: We compare the diagnosis performance of ai-corona, radiologists, and model-assisted radiologists for six combinations of distinguishing between the three mentioned classes, including COVID-19 abnormal vs. others, COVID-19 abnormal vs. normal, COVID-19 abnormal vs. non COVID-19 abnormal, non COVID-19 abnormal vs. others, normal vs. others, and normal vs. abnormal. ai-corona achieves an AUC score of 0.989 (95% CI: 0.984, 0.994), 0.997 (95% CI: 0.995, 0.999), 0.986 (95% CI: 0.981, 0.991), 0.959 (95% CI: 0.944, 0.974), 0.978 (95% CI: 0.968, 0.988), and 0.961 (95% CI: 0.951, 0.971) in each combination, respectively. By employing Bayesian statistics to calculate the accuracies at a 95% confidence interval, ai-corona surpasses the radiologists in distinguishing between the COVID-19 abnormal class and the other two classes (especially the non COVID-19 abnormal class). Our results show that radiologists diagnostic performance improves when incorporating ai-coronas prediction. In addition, we also show that RT-PCRs diagnosis has a much lower sensitivity compared to all the other methods. Conclusion: ai-corona is a radiologist-assistant deep learning framework for fast and accurate COVID19 diagnosis in chest CT scans. Our results ascertain that our framework, as a reliable detection tool, also improves experts diagnosis performance and helps especially in diagnosing non-typical COVID-19 cases or non COVID-19 abnormal cases that manifest COVID-19 imaging features in chest CT scan.

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is related in the most recent pandemic situation, significantly affecting health and economic systems. In this study we assessed the death rate associated to COVID-19 in Brazil and the United States of America (USA) to estimate the probability of Brazil becoming the next pandemic epicenter. We equated data between Brazil and USA obtained through the Worldometer website (www.worldometer.info). Epidemic curves from Brazil and USA were associated and regression analysis was undertaken to predict the Brazilian death rate regarding COVID-19 in June. In view of data from April 9th 2020, death rates in Brazil follow a similar exponential increase to USA (r=0.999; p<0.001), estimating 64,310 deaths by June 9th 2020. In brief, our results demonstrated that Brazil follows an analogous progression of COVID-19 deaths cases when compared to USA, signifying that Brazil could be the next global epicenter of COVID-19. We highlight public strategies to decrease the COVID-19 outbreak.",

    "abstract": "An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 has now been confirmed globally. In absence of effective vaccines, infection prevention and control through diagnostic testing and quarantine is critical. Early detection and differential diagnosis of respiratory infections increases the chances for successful control of COVID-19 disease. The nucleic acid RT-PCR test is regarded as the current standard for molecular diagnosis with high sensitivity. However, the highest specificity confirmation target ORF1ab gene is considered to be less sensitive than other targets in clinical application. In addition, a large amount of recent evidence indicates that the initial missed diagnosis of asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 and discharged patients with \"re-examination positive\" may be due to low viral load, and the ability of rapid mutation of coronavirus also increases the rate of false negative results. We aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of different nucleic acid detection kits so as to make recommendations for the selection of validation kit, and amplify the suspicious result to be reportable positive by means of simple continuous amplification, which is of great significance for the prevention and control of the current epidemic and the discharge criteria of low viral load patients.",

    "abstract": "Following detection of the first few COVID-19 cases in early March, Bangladesh has stepped up its efforts to strengthen capacity of the healthcare system to avert a crisis in the event of a surge in the number of cases. This paper sheds light on the preparedness of the healthcare system by examining the spatial distribution of isolation beds across districts and divisions, forecasting the number of ICU units that may be required in the short term and analyzing the availability of frontline healthcare workers to combat the pandemic. As of May 2, COVID-19 cases have been found in 61 of the 64 districts in Bangladesh with Dhaka District being the epicenter. Seventy-one percent of the cases have been identified in 6 neighboring districts, namely, Dhaka, Narayanganj, Gazipur, Narsingdi, Munsiganj and Kishoreganj, which appear to form a spatial cluster. However, if one takes into account the population at risk, the prevalence appears to be highest in Dhaka, followed by Narayanganj, Gazipur, Kishorganj, Narsingdi and Munshiganj. These regions may therefore be flagged as the COVID-19 hotspots in Bangladesh. Among the eight divisions, prevalence is highest in Dhaka Division followed by Mymensingh. The number of cases per million exceeds the number of available isolation beds per million in the major hotspots indicating that there is a risk of the healthcare system becoming overwhelmed should the number of cases rise. This is especially true for Dhaka Division, where the ratio of COVID-19 patients to doctors appears to be alarmingly high. Mymensingh Division also has a disproportionately small number of doctors relative to the number of COVID-19 patients. Using second order polynomial regression, the analysis predicts that even if all ICU beds are allocated to COVID-19 patients, Bangladesh may run out of ICU beds soon after May 15, 2020. We conclude that in spite of a significant increase in hospital capacity during 2005-15 and a 57 % rise in the number of doctors during the same period, the healthcare system in Bangladesh and Dhaka Division in particular, may not be fully prepared to handle the COVID-19 crisis. Thus, further steps need to be taken to flatten the curve and improve healthcare capacity.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: The case fatality rate from COVID-19 differs markedly around the world. There are likely a number of factors one can attribute to such disparity, not least of which is differing healthcare models and approaches. Here, we examine the COVID-19 related health advice issued by six different countries, specifically examining the patient-led triage pathways in each country. Methods: A simulation study was conducted on current, nationwide, patient-led triage systems from three countries with low case fatality rates (Singapore, Norway and Japan) and two countries with high case fatality rates (the USA and the UK). Cases were simulated by clinicians to approximate typical COVID-19 presentations (mild, severe and critical), and COVID-19 mimickers (sepsis, bacterial pneumonia). The same simulations were applied to each of the five countrys patient-led triage systems, and the recommendations to refer on for medical care or to advise to stay at home were recorded and compared. Statistical analysis examined the potential correlation between triage outcomes and case fatality rates. Results: Patient-led triage systems from Singapore, Japan and Norway maintained a low threshold for advising clinical contact for patients with possible COVID-19 (88 to 100% of cases were referred). Patient-led triage systems from the USA and the UK maintained high thresholds for advising contact with either call centre support or clinical contact (28 and 33% of cases were referred, respectively), and triaged the majority of cases home with no further healthcare input. There was a strong inverse correlation between percentage of cases referred and the nations case fatality rate (Pearsons Correlation = -0.642, p = 0.01). Conclusion: In this simulation study, the triage algorithms of Singapore, Norway and Japan successfully identified severe COVID-19 and triaged such cases to medical care. The USA triage system and the UKs triage system performed poorly, failing to identify severe COVID-19 infection and sepsis. In this study, the performance of national COVID-19 triage systems strongly correlate with case fatality rates.",

    "abstract": "The capacity of current molecular testing convention does not allow high-throughput and community level scans of COVID-19 infections. The diameter in current paradigm of shallow tracing is unlikely to reach the silent clusters that might be as important as the symptomatic cases in the spread of the disease. Group testing is a feasible and promising approach when the resources are scarce and when a relatively low prevalence regime is observed on the population. We employed group testing with a sparse random pooling scheme and conventional group test decoding algorithms both for exact and inexact recovery. Our simulations showed that significant reduction in per case test numbers (or expansion in total test numbers preserving the number of actual tests conducted) for very sparse prevalence regimes is available. Currently proposed COVID-19 group testing schemes offer a gain up to 10X scale-up. There is a good probability that the required scale up to achieve massive scale testing might be greater in certain scenarios. We investigated if further improvement is available, especially in sparse prevalence occurrence where outbreaks are needed to be avoided by population scans. Our simulations show that sparse random pooling can provide improved efficiency gains compared to row-column group testing or Reed-Solomon error correcting codes. Therefore, we propose that special designs for different scenarios could be available and it is possible to scale up testing capabilities significantly.",

    "abstract": "Novel corona virus is declared as pandemic and India is struggling to control this from a massive attack of death and destruction, similar to the other countries like China, Europe, and the United States of America. India reported 2545 cases novel corona confirmed cases as of April 2, 2020 and out of which 191 cases were reported recovered and 72 deaths occurred. The first case of novel corona is reported in India on January 30, 2020. The growth in the initial phase is following exponential. In this study an attempt has been made to model the spread of novel corona infection. For this purpose logistic growth model with minor modification is used and the model is applied on truncated information on novel corona confirmed cases in India. The result is very exiting that till date predicted number of confirmed corona positive cases is very close to observed on. The time of point of inflexion is found in the end of the April, 2020 means after that the increasing growth will start decline and there will be no new case in India by the end of July, 2020.",

    "abstract": "Background: The National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) is currently recommended in the United Kingdom for risk stratification of COVID outcomes, but little is known about its ability to detect severe cases. We aimed to evaluate NEWS2 for severe COVID outcome and identify and validate a set of routinely-collected blood and physiological parameters taken at hospital admission to improve the score. Methods: Training cohorts comprised 1276 patients admitted to King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust with COVID-19 disease from 1st March to 30th April 2020. External validation cohorts included 5037 patients from four UK NHS Trusts (Guys and St Thomas' Hospitals, University Hospitals Southampton, University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, University College London Hospitals), and two hospitals in Wuhan, China (Wuhan Sixth Hospital and Taikang Tongji Hospital). The outcome was severe COVID disease (transfer to intensive care unit or death) at 14 days after hospital admission. Age, physiological measures, blood biomarkers, sex, ethnicity and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular, respiratory and kidney diseases) measured at hospital admission were considered in the models. Results: A baseline model of 'NEWS2 + age' had poor-to-moderate discrimination for severe COVID infection at 14 days (AUC in training sample = 0.700; 95% CI: 0.680, 0.722; Brier score = 0.192; 95% CI: 0.186, 0.197). A supplemented model adding eight routinely-collected blood and physiological parameters (supplemental oxygen flow rate, urea, age, oxygen saturation, CRP, estimated GFR, neutrophil count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio) improved discrimination (AUC = 0.735; 95% CI: 0.715, 0.757) and these improvements were replicated across five UK and non-UK sites. However, there was evidence of miscalibration with the model tending to underestimate risks in most sites. Conclusions: NEWS2 score had poor-to-moderate discrimination for medium-term COVID outcome which raises questions about its use as a screening tool at hospital admission. Risk stratification was improved by including readily available blood and physiological parameters measured at hospital admission, but there was evidence of miscalibration in external sites. This highlights the need for a better understanding of the use of early warning scores for COVID.",

    "abstract": "The outbreak of COVID-19 since Dec. 2019 has caused severe life and economic damage worldwide, many countries are trapped by medical resource constraints or absence of targeted therapeutics, and therefore the implement of systemic policies to block this pandemic should be prioritized. Based on the transmission mechanisms and physicochemical properties of betacoronaviruses, we construct a fine-grained transmission dynamics model (ICRD) to forecast the crucial information of public concern, therein using dynamical coefficients to quantify the impact of the implement time and intensity of containment policies on the spread of epidemic. We find that the comprehensive investigation policy for susceptible population and the quarantine for suspected cases eminently contribute to reduce casualties during the phase of the dramatic increase of diagnosed cases. Statistic evidences strongly suggest that society should take such forceful public health interventions to cut the infection channels in the initial stage until the pandemic is interrupted.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the blood coagulation function in COVID-19 patients, and the correlation between coagulopathy and disease severity. Methods: We retrospectively collected 147 clinically diagnosed COVID-19 patients at Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital of Hubei, China. We analyzed the coagulation function in COVID-19 patients through the data including thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), 2-plasmininhibitor-plasmin Complex (PIC), thrombomodulin (TM), t-PA/PAI-1 Complex (t-PAIC), prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (FIB), thrombin time (TT), D-Dimer (DD), and platelet (PLT). Result: The levels of TAT, PIC, TM, t-PAIC, PT, INR, FIB, and DD in COVID-19 patients were higher than health controls (p<0.05), and also higher in the patients with thrombotic disease than without thrombotic disease (p<0.05). What's more, the patients with thrombotic disease had a higher case-fatality (p<0.05). TAT, PIC, TM, t-PAIC, PT, INR, APTT, FIB, DD, and PLT were also found correlated with disease severity. Meanwhile, we found that there were significant difference in TAT, TM, t-PAIC, PT, INR, APTT, DD, and PLT in the death and survival group. Further using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis also found that t-PAIC and DD were independent risk factors for death in patients and are excellent predicting the mortality risk of COVID-19. Conclusion: The coagulation systems in COVID-19 patients are inordinate, and dynamic monitoring of them, might be a key in the control of COVID-19 death.",

    "abstract": "Background: No firm recommendations are currently available to guide decision making for patients requiring cardiac surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Systematic appraisal of national expert consensus can be used to generate interim recommendations until data from clinical observations will become available. Hence, we aimed to collect and quantitatively appraise nationwide UK senior surgeons opinion on clinical decision making for patients requiring cardiac surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We mailed a web-based questionnaire to all consultant cardiac surgeons through the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery in Great Britain and Ireland (SCTS) mailing list on the 17th April 2020 and we pre-determined to close the survey on the 21st April 2020. This survey was primarily designed to gather information on UK surgeons opinion using 12 items. Strong consensus was predefined as an opinion shared by at least 60% of responding consultants. Results: A total of 86 consultant surgeons undertook the survey. All UK cardiac units were represented by at least one consultant. Strong consensus was achieved for the following key questions:1) before hospital admission every patient should receive nasopharyngeal swab, PCR and chest CT; 2) the use of full PPE should to be adopted in every case by the theatre team regardless patients COVID-19 status; 3) the risk of COVID-19 exposure for patients undergoing heart surgery should be considered moderate to high and likely to increase mortality if it occurs; 4) cardiac procedure should be decided based on ad-hoc multidisciplinary team discussion for every patient. The majority believed that both aortic and mitral surgery should be considered in selected cases. The role of CABG surgery during the pandemic was more controversial. Conclusions: In the current unprecedented scenario, the present survey provides information for generating interim recommendations until data from clinical observations will become available.",

    "abstract": "The rapid and pandemic spread of COVID-19 has led to unprecedented containment policies in response to overloaded health care systems. Disease mitigation strategies require informed decision-making to ensure a balance between the protection of the vulnerable from disease and the maintenance of global economies. We show that temporally restricted containment efforts, that have the potential to flatten epidemic curves, can result in wider disease spread and larger epidemic sizes in metapopulations. Longer-term rewiring of metapopulation networks or the enforcement of feasible long-term measures that decrease disease transmissions appear to be more efficient than temporarily restricted intensive mitigation strategies (e.g. short-term mass quarantine). Our results may inform balanced containment strategies for short-term disease spread mitigation in response to overloaded health care systems and longer-term epidemiological sizes.",

A statistical analysis of currently available positive test frequency data reveals a surprisingly uniform relationship between the number of CoV-19 test performed and the number of positive tests obtained. The uniformity is particularly striking for United States CoV-19 test data. Such observations warrant closer evaluation of other factors, besides virus spread, that may also contribute to the nature of the coronavirus pandemic. These include indigenous CoV-19 and the quality of CoV-19 testing.",

Palestinian COVID-19 mortality number is equal to 6 per million. It is small compared to countries neighboring Palestine. The infected number is equal to 88.4 per million, which is less than most of its neighbors. The basic reproduction number is still greater than 1.

    "abstract": "Objectives: Health care system of many countries are facing a surging burden of COVID-19. Although Vietnam has successfully controlled the COVID-19 pandemic to date, there is a sign of initial community transmission. An estimate of possible scenarios to prepare health resources in the future is needed. We used modelling methods to estimate impacts of mitigation measures on the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam. Methods: SEIR model built in the COVIDSIM1.1 tool was adopted using available data for estimation. The herd immunization scenario was with no intervention implemented. Other scenarios consisted of isolation and social distancing at different levels (25%, 50%, 75% and 10%, 20%, 30%, respectively). Outcomes include epidemic apex, daily new and cumulative cases, deaths, hospitalized patients and ICU beds needed. Results: By April 8, 2020, there would be 465 infected cases with COVID-19 in Viet Nam, of those 50% were detected. Cumulatively, there would be 1,400 cases and 30 deaths by end of 2020, if 75% of cases was detected and isolated, and 30% of social distancing could be maintained. The most effective intervention scenario is the detection and isolation of 75% infected cases and reduction of 10% social contacts. This will require an expansion of testing capacity at health facilities and in the community, posing a challenge to identify high-risk groups to prioritized testing. Conclusions: In a localized epidemic setting, the expansion of testing should be the key measure to control the epidemic. Social distancing plays a significant role to prevent further transmission to the community.",

    "abstract": "Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are used extensively in malaria and rheumatological conditions, and now in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. Although generally safe they are potentially lethal in overdose. In-vitro data suggest that high concentrations and thus high doses are needed for COVID-19 infections, but as yet there is no convincing evidence they are clinically effective. Bayesian regression models were fitted to survival outcomes and electrocardiograph QRS durations from 302 prospectively studied French patients who had taken intentional chloroquine overdoses, of whom 33 died (11%), and 16 healthy volunteers who took 620 mg base chloroquine single doses. Whole blood concentrations of 13.5 umol/L (95% credible interval 10.1-17.7) were associated with 1% mortality. Prolongation of ventricular depolarisation is concentration-dependent with a QRS duration >150 msec independently highly predictive of mortality. Pharmacokinetic modelling combined with these lethality data predicts that the majority of chloroquine regimens trialled in COVID-19 should not cause serious cardiovascular toxicity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a serious infectious disease affecting human health worldwide and rapidly declared a pandemic by WHO. Early, several RT-qPCR were designed by using only the first SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence.\n\nObjectivesA few days later, when additional SARS-CoV-2 genome were retrieved, the kit GPS CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test was designed to provide a highly specific detection method and commercially available worldwide. The kit was validated following criteria recommended by the UNE/EN ISO 17025:2005 and ISO/IEC 15189:2012.\n\nMethodsThe present study approached the in silico specificity of the GPS CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test and RT-qPCR designs currently published. The empirical validation parameters specificity (inclusivity/exclusivity), quantitative phase analysis (10-106 copies), reliability (repeatability/reproducibility) and sensitivity (detection/quantification limits) were evaluated for a minimum of 10-15 assays. Diagnostic validation was achieved by two independent reference laboratories, the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), (Madrid, Spain) and the Public Health England (PHE; Colindale, London, UK).\n\nResultsThe GPS RT-qPCR primers and probe showed the highest number of mismatches with the closet related non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, including some indels. The kits passed all parameters of validation with strict acceptance criteria. Results from reference laboratories 100% correlated with these obtained by suing reference methods and received an evaluation with 100% of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.\n\nConclusionsThe GPS CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test, available with full analytical and diagnostic validation, represents a case of efficient transfer of technology being successfully used since the pandemic was declared. The analysis suggested the GPS CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test is the more exclusive by far.",

    "abstract": "We study the dynamics of epidemics in a networked metapopulation model. In each subpopulation, representing a locality, disease propagates according to a modified susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) dynamics. We assume that individuals reduce their number of contacts as a function of the weighted sum of cumulative number of cases within the locality and in neighboring localities. We also assume that susceptible and exposed (pre-symptomatic and infectious) individuals can travel between localities. To investigate the combined effects of mobility and contact reduction on disease progression within interconnected localities, we consider a scenario with two localities where disease originates in one and is exported to the neighboring locality via travel of undetected pre-symptomatic individuals. We establish a lower bound on the outbreak size at the origin as a function of the speed of spread. We associate the behavior change at the disease-importing locality due to the outbreak size at the origin with the level of preparedness of the locality. Using the lower bound on the outbreak size at the origin, we establish an upper bound on the outbreak size at the importing locality as a function of the speed of spread and the level of preparedness for low mobility regimes. We show the accuracy of the bounds in determining critical levels of preparedness that stop the disease from becoming endemic at neighboring localities. Finally, we show how the benefit of preparedness diminishes under high mobility rates. Our results highlight the importance of preparedness at localities where cases are beginning to rise, and demonstrate the benefits of increase in contact reduction by considering the outbreaks in neighboring localities with severe, rather than weak, outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, a generalized fractional-order SEIR model is proposed, denoted by SEIQRP model, which has a basic guiding significance for the prediction of the possible outbreak of infectious diseases like COVID-19 and other insect diseases in the future. Firstly, some qualitative properties of the model are analyzed. The basic reproduction number R0 is derived. When R0 < 1, the disease-free equilibrium point is unique and locally asymptotically stable. When R0 > 1, the endemic equilibrium point is also unique. Furthermore, some conditions are established to ensure the local asymptotic stability of disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. The trend of COVID-19 spread in the United States is predicted. Considering the influence of the individual behavior and government mitigation measurement, a modified SEIQRP model is proposed, defined as SEIQRPD model. According to the real data of the United States, it is found that our improved model has a better prediction ability for the epidemic trend in the next two weeks. Hence, the epidemic trend of the United States in the next two weeks is investigated, and the peak of isolated cases are predicted. The modified SEIQRP model successfully capture the development process of COVID-19, which provides an important reference for understanding the trend of the outbreak.",

    "abstract": "The pandemic spread of the COVID-19 virus has, as of 20th of April 2020, reached most countries of the world. In an effort to design informed public health policies, many modelling studies have been performed to predict crucial outcomes of interest, including ICU solicitation, cumulated death counts, etc... The corresponding data analyses however, mostly rely on restricted (openly available) data sources, which typically include daily death rates and confirmed COVID cases time series. In addition, many of these predictions are derived before the peak of the outbreak has been observed yet (as is still currently the case for many countries). In this work, we show that peak phase and data paucity have a substantial impact on the reliability of model predictions. Although we focus on a recent model of the COVID pandemics, our conclusions most likely apply to most existing models, which are variants of the so-called 'Susceptible-Infected-Removed' or SIR framework. Our results highlight the need for performing systematic reliability evaluations for all models that currently inform public health policies. They also motivate a plea for gathering and opening richer and more reliable data time series (e.g., ICU occupancy, negative test rates, social distancing commitment reports, etc).",

    "abstract": "Mental health and wellbeing impacts of COVID19 were assessed in a convenience sample of 600 UK adults using a cross-sectional design. Recruited over a two-week period during the initial phase of the government lockdown, participants completed an online survey that included COVID19-related questions, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the WHO-5 and the OXCAP-MH. Self-isolating prior to lockdown, increased feelings of isolation since the lockdown, and having COVID19-related livelihood concerns, were associated with poorer mental health, wellbeing and quality of life. Perceiving increased kindness, community connectedness, and being an essential worker were associated with better mental health and wellbeing outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: The Epic Deterioration Index (EDI) is a proprietary prediction model implemented in over 100 U.S. hospitals that was widely used to support medical decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic. The EDI has not been independently evaluated, and other proprietary models have been shown to be biased against vulnerable populations. Methods: We studied adult patients admitted with COVID-19 to non-ICU care at a large academic medical center from March 9 through May 20, 2020. We used the EDI, calculated at 15-minute intervals, to predict a composite outcome of ICU-level care, mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death. In a subset of patients hospitalized for at least 48 hours, we also evaluated the ability of the EDI to identify patients at low risk of experiencing this composite outcome during their remaining hospitalization. Results: Among 392 COVID-19 hospitalizations meeting inclusion criteria, 103 (26%) met the composite outcome. Median age of the cohort was 64 (IQR 53-75) with 168 (43%) African Americans and 169 (43%) women. Area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) of the EDI was 0.79 (95% CI 0.74-0.84). EDI predictions did not differ by race or sex. When exploring clinically-relevant thresholds of the EDI, we found patients who met or exceeded an EDI of 68.8 made up 14% of the study cohort and had a 74% probability of experiencing the composite outcome during their hospitalization with a median lead time of 24 hours from when this threshold was first exceeded. Among the 286 patients hospitalized for at least 48 hours who had not experienced the composite outcome, 14 (13%) never exceeded an EDI of 37.9, with a negative predictive value of 90% and a sensitivity above this threshold of 91%. Conclusion: We found the EDI identifies small subsets of high- and low-risk COVID-19 patients with fair discrimination. We did not find evidence of bias by race or sex. These findings highlight the importance of independent evaluation of proprietary models before widespread operational use among COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has surprised the world since the beginning of 2020, and the rapid growth of COVID-19 is beyond the capability of doctors and hospitals that could deal in many areas. The chest computed tomography (CT) could be serve as an effective tool in detection of COVID-19. Its valuable to develop automatic detection of COVID-19. Material and Methods: The collected dataset consisted of 521 COVID-19 chest CT images, 397 normal chest CT images, 76 bacterial pneumonia chest CT images and 48 SARS chest CT images obtained by exhaustively searching available data on the Internet. Then, these data are divided into three sets, referred to training set, validation set and testing set. Sixteen data augmentation operations are designed to enrich the training set in deep learning training phase. Multiple experiments were conducted to analyze the performance of the model in the detection of COVID-19 both in case of no noisy labels and noisy labels. The performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC), sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Results: The data augmentation operations on the training set is effective for improvement of the model performance. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve is 0.9689 with (95% CI: 0.9308, 1) in case of no noisy labels, while the per-exam sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for detecting COVID-19 in the independent testing set are 90.52%, 91.58% and 91.21%, respectively. Besides, the model is robust when part of the training samples is marked incorrectly. The AUC is 92.23% in the case of noisy labels of 10% in the training set. Conclusion A deep learning model with insufficient samples can be developed by using data augmentation in assisting medical workers in making quick and correct diagnosis of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The infection by SARS-CoV-2 which causes the COVID-19 disease has widely spread all over the world since the beginning of2020. On January 30, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency. Researchers of different disciplines work along with public health officials to understand the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and jointly with the policymakers urgently develop strategies to control the spread of this new disease. Recent findings have observed imaging patterns on computed tomography (CT) for patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. In this paper, we build a public available SARS-CoV-2 CTscan dataset, containing 1252 CT scans that are positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) and 1230 CT scans for patientsnon-infected by SARS-CoV-2, 2482 CT scans in total. These data have been collected from real patients in hospitals from Sao Paulo, Brazil. The aim of this dataset is to encourage the research and development of artificial intelligent methods which are able to identify if a person is infected by SARS-CoV-2 through the analysis of his/her CT scans. As a baseline result for this dataset we used an eXplainable Deep Learning approach (xDNN) which we could achieve anF1score of 97.31% which is very promising. The proposed dataset is available www.kaggle.com/plameneduardo/sarscov2-ctscan-datasetand xDNN code is available at https://github.com/Plamen-Eduardo/xDNN-SARS-CoV-2-CT-Scan.",

    "abstract": "Background Despite measures such as travel restrictions and lockdowns, the novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) is projected to spread across India. Considering that a vaccine for COVID-19 is will not be available soon, it is important to identify populations with high risk from COVID-19 and take measures to prevent outbreaks and build healthcare infrastructure at the local level. Methods We used data from two large nationally representative household surveys, administrative sources, and published studies to estimate the risk of COVID-19 at the district level in India. We employed principal component analysis to create an index of the health risk of COVID-19 from demographic and comorbidity indicators such as the proportions of elderly population and rates of diabetes, hypertension, and respiratory illnesses. Another principal component index examined the socioeconomic and healthcare access risk from COVID-19, based on the standard of living, proportion of caste groups, and per capita access to public healthcare in each district. Results Districts in northern, southern and western Indian states such as Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Maharashtra were at the highest health risk from COVID-19. Many of these districts have been designated as COVID-19 hotspots by the Indian government because of emergent outbreaks. Districts in eastern and central states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh have higher socioeconomic and healthcare access risk as compared with other areas. Interpretation Districts at high risk of COVID-19 should prioritize policy measures for preventing outbreaks, and improving critical care infrastructure and socioeconomic safety nets.",

    "abstract": "Substantial amount of data about the COVID-19 pandemic is generated every day. Yet, data streaming, while considerably visualized, is not accompanied with advanced modelling techniques to provide real-time insights. This study introduces a unified platform which integrates visualization capabilities with advanced statistical methods for predicting the virus spread in the short run, using real-time data. The platform is backed up by advanced time series models to capture any possible non-linearity in the data which is enhanced by the capability of measuring the expected impact of preventive interventions such as social distancing and lockdowns. The platform enables lay users, and experts, to examine the data and develop several customized models with different restriction such as models developed for specific time window of the data. Our policy assessment of the case of Australia, shows that social distancing and travel ban restriction significantly affect the reduction of number of cases, as an effective policy.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have demonstrated the advantages of environmental surveillance through the monitoring of sewer systems for the assessment of viruses circulating in a given community (wastewater-based epidemiology, WBE). During the COVID-19 public health emergency, many reports have described the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stools from COVID-19 patients, and a few studies reported the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters worldwide. Italy is among the world's worst-affected countries in the COVID-19 pandemic, but so far there are no studies assessing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in Italian wastewaters. To this aim, twelve influent sewage samples, collected between February and April 2020 from Wastewater Treatment Plants in Milan and Rome, were tested adapting, for concentration, the standard WHO procedure for Poliovirus surveillance. Molecular analysis was undertaken with three nested protocols, including a newly designed SARS-CoV-2 specific primer set. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection occurred in volumes of 250 mL of wastewaters collected in both areas at high (Milan) and low (Rome) epidemic circulation, according to clinical data. Overall, 6 out of 12 samples were positive. One of the positive results was obtained in a Milan wastewater sample collected a few days after the first notified Italian case of autochthonous SARS-CoV-2. The study shows that WBE has the potential to be applied to SARS-CoV-2 as a sensitive tool to study spatial and temporal trends of virus circulation in the population.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 most likely evolved from a bat beta-coronavirus and started infecting humans in December 2019. Since then it has rapidly infected people around the world, with more than 4.5 million confirmed cases by the middle of May 2020. Early genome sequencing of the virus has enabled the development of molecular diagnostics and the commencement of therapy and vaccine development. The analysis of the early sequences showed relatively few evolutionary selection pressures. However, with the rapid worldwide expansion into diverse human populations, significant genetic variations are becoming increasingly likely. The current limitations on social movement between countries also offers the opportunity for these viral variants to become distinct strains with potential implications for diagnostics, therapies and vaccines.\n\nMethodsWe used the current sequencing archives (NCBI and GISAID) to investigate 15,487 whole genomes, looking for evidence of strain diversification and selective pressure.\n\nResultsWe used 6,294 SNPs to build a phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 diversity and noted strong evidence for the existence of two major clades and six sub-clades, unevenly distributed across the world. We also noted that convergent evolution has potentially occurred across several locations in the genome, showing selection pressures, including on the spike glycoprotein where we noted a potentially critical mutation that could affect its binding to the ACE2 receptor. We also report on mutations that could prevent current molecular diagnostics from detecting some of the sub-clades.\n\nConclusionThe worldwide whole genome sequencing effort is revealing the challenge of developing SARS-CoV-2 containment tools suitable for everyone and the need for data to be continually evaluated to ensure accuracy in outbreak estimations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSARS-CoV-2, a positive-sense RNA virus in the family Coronaviridae, has caused a worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 Coronaviruses generate a tiered series of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) through a process involving homology between transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS) located after the leader sequence in the 5 UTR (the TRS-L) and TRS located near the start of structural and accessory proteins (TRS-B) near the 3 end of the genome. In addition to the canonical sgRNAs generated by SARS-CoV-2, non-canonical sgRNAs (nc-sgRNAs) have been reported. However, the consistency of these nc-sgRNAs across viral isolates and infection conditions is unknown. The comprehensive definition of SARS-CoV-2 RNA products is a key step in understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.\n\nMethodsHere, we report an integrative analysis of eight independent SARS-CoV-2 transcriptomes generated using three sequencing strategies, five host systems, and seven viral isolates. Read-mapping to the SARS-CoV-2 genome was used to determine the 5 and 3 coordinates of all identified junctions in viral RNAs identified in these samples.\n\nResultsUsing junctional abundances, we show nc-sgRNAs make up as much as 33% of total sgRNAs in vitro, are largely consistent in abundance across independent transcriptomes, and increase in abundance over time during in vitro infection. By assessing the homology between sequences flanking the 5 and 3 junction points, we show that nc-sgRNAs are not associated with TRS-like homology. By incorporating read coverage information, we find strong evidence for subgenomic RNAs that contain only 5 regions of ORF1a. Finally, we show that non-canonical junctions change the landscape of viral open reading frames.\n\nConclusionsWe identify canonical and non-canonical junctions in SARS-CoV-2 sgRNAs and show that these RNA products are consistently generated across many independent viral isolates and sequencing approaches. These analyses highlight the diverse transcriptional activity of SARS-CoV-2 and offer important insights into SARS-CoV-2 biology.",

    "abstract": "Summary Background: Hospitals need to plan for the surge in demand in each state or region in the United States and the European Economic Area (EEA) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Planners need forecasts of the most likely trajectory in the coming weeks and will want to plan for the higher values in the range of those forecasts. To date, forecasts of what is most likely to occur in the weeks ahead are not available for states in the USA or for all countries in the EEA. Methods: This study used data on confirmed COVID-19 deaths by day from local and national government websites and WHO. Data on hospital capacity and utilisation and observed COVID-19 utilisation data from select locations were obtained from publicly available sources and direct contributions of data from select local governments. We develop a mixed effects non-linear regression framework to estimate the trajectory of the cumulative and daily death rate as a function of the implementation of social distancing measures, supported by additional evidence from mobile phone data. An extended mixture model was used in data rich settings to capture asymmetric daily death patterns. Health service needs were forecast using a micro-simulation model that estimates hospital admissions, ICU admissions, length of stay, and ventilator need using available data on clinical practices in COVID-19 patients. We assume that those jurisdictions that have not implemented school closures, non-essential business closures, and stay at home orders will do so within twenty-one days. Findings: Compared to licensed capacity and average annual occupancy rates, excess demand in the USA from COVID-19 at the estimated peak of the epidemic (the end of the second week of April) is predicted to be 9,079 (95% UI 253-61,937) total beds and 9,356 (3,526-29,714) ICU beds. At the peak of the epidemic, ventilator use is predicted to be 16,545 (8,083-41,991). The corresponding numbers for EEA countries are 120,080 (119,183-121,107), 32,291 (32,157-32,425) and 28,973 (28,868-29,085) at a peak of April 6. The date of peak daily deaths varies from March 30 through May 12 by state in the USA and March 27 through May 4 by country in the EEA. We estimate that through the end of July, there will be 60,308 (34,063-140,381) deaths from COVID-19 in the USA and 143,088 (101,131-253,163) deaths in the EEA. Deaths from COVID-19 are estimated to drop below 0.3 per million between May 4 and June 29 by state in the USA and between May 4 and July 13 by country in the EEA. Timing of the peak need for hospital resource requirements varies considerably across states in the USA and across regions of Europe. Interpretation: In addition to a large number of deaths from COVID-19, the epidemic will place a load on health system resources well beyond the current capacity of hospitals in the USA and EEA to manage, especially for ICU care and ventilator use. These estimates can help inform the development and implementation of strategies to mitigate this gap, including reducing non-COVID-19 demand for services and temporarily increasing system capacity. The estimated excess demand on hospital systems is predicated on the enactment of social distancing measures within three weeks in all locations that have not done so already and maintenance of these measures throughout the epidemic, emphasising the importance of implementing, enforcing, and maintaining these measures to mitigate hospital system overload and prevent deaths.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has recently become a public emergency and a worldwide pandemic. The clinical symptoms of severe and non-severe patients vary, and the case-fatality rate (CFR) in severe COVID-19 patients is very high. However, the information on the risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19 and of their prognostic potential is limited. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment and outcome data were collected and analyzed from 223 COVID-19 patients stratified into 125 non-severe patients and 98 severe patients. In addition, a pooled large-scale meta-analysis of 1646 cases was performed. RESULTS: We found that the age, gender and comorbidities are the common risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19. For the diagnosis markers, we found that the levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), procalcitonin (PCT) were significantly higher in severe group compared with the non-severe group on admission (D-Dimer: 87.3% vs. 35.3%, P<0.001; CRP, 65.1% vs. 13.5%, P<0.001; LDH: 83.9% vs. 22.2%, P<0.001; PCT: 35.1% vs. 2.2%, P<0.001), while the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (ASP) and creatinine kinase (CK) were only mildly increased. We also made a large scale meta-analysis of 1646 cases combined with 4 related literatures, and further confirmed the relationship between the COVID-19 severity and these risk factors. Moreover, we tracked dynamic changes during the process of COVID-19, and found CRP, D-dimer, LDH, PCT kept in high levels in severe patient. Among all these markers, D-dimer increased remarkably in severe patients and mostly related with the case-fatality rate (CFR). We found adjuvant antithrombotic treatment in some severe patients achieved good therapeutic effect in the cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis markers CRP, D-dimer, LDH and PCT are associated with severity of COVID-19. Among these markers, D-dimer is sensitive for both severity and CFR of COVID-19. Treatment with heparin or other anticoagulants may be beneficial for COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19) has an estimated overall case fatality ratio of 1.38% in China, being 53% higher in males and increasing exponentially with age. Mosaicism for X chromosome monosomy (XCM) shows a similar increase in aging population mostly driven by loss of chromosome Y in males (LOY), and is associated with a raise in all-cause mortality. Using comparative transcriptomic data, we have defined that XCM/LOY is associated with abnormal peripheral blood cell counts with decreased progenitor cells and multiple biomarkers of immune system dysfunction, pro-coagulation activity and increased cardiovascular risk. Several differentially down-regulated genes in XCM/LOY individuals are involved in the initial immune response to SARS-CoV-2 (OR of enrichment=7.23, p=1.5x10-7), mainly interferon-induced genes that code for inhibitors of viral processes. Thus, our data suggest that XCM mosaicism underlies at least part of the sex-biased severity and mortality of COVID-19 in aging patients. Given its potential relevance for modulating prognosis and therapeutic response, we propose that evaluation of LOY and XCM by currently established methods should be implemented as biomarkers in infected patients, including currently ongoing clinical trials with different medications and vaccines for COVID-19. Testing for LOY/XCM at large scale among elderly people may also be helpful to identify still unexposed people who may be especially vulnerable to severe Covid-19 disease.",

    "abstract": "Background. Reporting of daily hospital COVID-19 deaths in the UK are promoted by the government and scientific advisers alike as a key metric for assessing the progress in the control of the epidemic. These data, however, have certain limitations, among which one of the most significant concerns the fact that the daily totals span deaths that have occurred between 1 and 10 days or more in the past. Data and methods. We obtained daily data published published by NHS England up to and including April 25 in the form of Excel spreadsheets in which deaths counts are presented by date of death according to age and region. Simple descriptive analyses were conducted and presented in graphical and tabular form which were aimed at illustrating the biases inherent in focussing on daily counts regardless of when the deaths occurred. We then looked at how a less biased picture could be obtained by looking at trends in death counts stratifying by individual period of delay in days between occurrence of death and when the death was included in the daily announcement. Findings. The number of hospital COVID-19 deaths announced daily overestimates the maximum number of deaths actually occurring so far in the epidemic in the UK, and also obscures the pattern of decline in deaths. Taking account of reporting delays suggests that for England as a whole a peak in hospital COVID-19 deaths may have been reached on April 8 with a subsequent gradual decline suggested. The same peak is also seen among those aged 60-79 and 80+, although there is slightly shallower decline in the oldest age group (80+ years). Among those aged 40-59 years a later peak on April 11 is evident. London shows a peak on April 8 and a clearer and steeper pattern of subsequent decline compared to England as a whole. Interpretation. Analyses of mortality trends must take account of delay, and in communication with the public more emphasis should be placed on looking at trends based on deaths that occurred 5 or more days prior to the announcement day. The slightly weaker decline seen at age 80+ may reflect increased hospitalisation of people from care homes, whereas the later peak under the age of 60 years may reflect the higher proportions at these younger ages being admitted to critical care resulting in an extension of life of several days.",

    "abstract": "Background The risk of severe COVID-19 disease is known to be higher in older individuals and those with underlying health conditions. Understanding the number of individuals at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness, and how this varies between countries may inform the design of possible strategies to shield those at highest risk. Methods We estimated the number of individuals at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease by age (5-year age groups), sex and country (n=188) based on prevalence data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study for 2017 and United Nations population estimates for 2020. We also calculated the number of individuals without an underlying condition that could be considered at-risk because of their age, using thresholds from 50-70 years. The list of underlying conditions relevant to COVID-19 disease was determined by mapping conditions listed in GBD to the guidelines published by WHO and public health agencies in the UK and US. We analysed data from two large multimorbidity studies to determine appropriate adjustment factors for clustering and multimorbidity. Results We estimate that 1.7 (1.0 - 2.4) billion individuals (22% [15-28%] of the global population) are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease. The share of the population at increased risk ranges from 16% in Africa to 31% in Europe. Chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and chronic respiratory disease (CRD) were the most prevalent conditions in males and females aged 50+ years. African countries with a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS and Island countries with a high prevalence of diabetes, also had a high share of the population at increased risk. The prevalence of multimorbidity (>1 underlying conditions) was three times higher in Europe than in Africa (10% vs 3%). Conclusion Based on current guidelines and prevalence data from GBD, we estimate that one in five individuals worldwide has a condition that is on the list of those at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease. However, for many of these individuals the underlying condition will be undiagnosed or not severe enough to be captured in health systems, and in some cases the increase in risk may be quite modest. There is an urgent need for robust analyses of the risks associated with different underlying conditions so that countries can identify the highest risk groups and develop targeted shielding policies to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "As the number of people affected by COVID-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 ebbs and flows in different national and sub-national regions across the world, it is evident that our lifestyle and socio-economic trajectories will have to be adapted and adjusted to the changing scenarios. Novel forecasting tools and frameworks provide an arguable advantage to facilitate this adapting and adjusting process, by promoting efficient resource management at individual and institutional levels. Based on deterministic compartment models we propose an empirical top-down modeling approach to provide epidemic forecasts and risk calculations for (local) outbreaks. We use neural networks to develop leading indicators based on available data for different regions. These indicators are not only used to assess the risk of a (new) outbreak or to determine the effectiveness of a measure at an early stage, but also in parametric models to determine an effective forecast, along with the associated uncertainty. Based on initial results, we show the performance of such an approach and its robustness against inherent disturbances in epidemiological surveillance data. We foresee such a statistical framework to drive web-based automatic platforms to democratize the dissemination of prognosis results.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To determine the long-term clinical problems in adult survivors of coronavirus (CoV) infection [Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)] after hospitalisation or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature. Data sources: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus and PsycINFO were searched using the strategy: (Coronavirus OR Coronavirus Infections OR COVID OR SARS virus OR Severe acute respiratory syndrome OR MERS OR Middle east respiratory syndrome) AND (Follow-up OR Follow-up studies OR Prevalence). Original studies reporting the clinical outcomes of adult survivors of coronavirus outbreaks two months after discharge or three months after admission were included. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) 2009 Level of Evidence Tool. Meta-analysis was conducted to derive pooled estimates of prevalence and severity for different outcomes at time points up to 6 months follow-up and beyond 6 months follow-up. Results: The search yielded 1169 studies of which 28 were included in this review. There were 15 Level 1b, 8 Level 2b, 2 Level 3b and 3 Level 4 studies by OCEBM grading. Pooled analysis of studies revealed that complications commonly observed were impaired diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) [prevalence of 27.26%, 95% CI 14.87 to 44.57] and reduced exercise capacity [(6-minute walking distance (6MWD) mean 461m, 95% CI 449.66 to 472.71] at 6 months with limited improvement beyond 6 months. Coronavirus survivors had considerable prevalence of psychological disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [38.80%, CI 30.93 to 47.31], depression [33.20%, CI 19.80 to 50.02] and anxiety [30.04%, CI 10.44 to 61.26) beyond 6 months. These complications were accompanied by low Short Form 36 (SF-36) scores at 6 months and beyond indicating reduced quality of life which is present long-term. Conclusions: The long term clinical problems in survivors of CoV infections (SARS and MERS) after hospitalisation or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission include respiratory dysfunction, reduced exercise capacity, psychological problems such as PTSD, depression and anxiety, and reduced quality of life. Critical care, rehabilitation and mental health services should anticipate a high prevalence of these problems following COVID-19 and ensure their adequate and timely management with the aim of restoring premorbid quality of life.",

Our design philosophy is not only to try to address potential ventilator shortages, but also to account for uncertainties in the supply chains of parts commonly used in traditional ventilators. To do so we employ a modular design approach and broadly explore taking advantage of parts from non-traditional supply chains. In our current prototype, we demonstrate volume control with assist control on a test lung and present a linear actuator-driven pinch valve-based implementation for both pressure control and volume control with decelerating inspiratory flow. We estimate the component cost of the system to be around $500. We publish our draft design documents and current implementation which is open and accessible in the hope that broadening the community globally will accelerate arriving at a solution and that peer review will improve the final design.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the contribution of population age structure to mortality from Covid-19 in the UK by geographical units. We project death rates at various spatial scales by applying data on age-specific fatality rates to the area's population by age and sex. Our analysis shows a significant variation in the projected death rates between the constituent countries of the UK, between its regions and within regions. First, Scotland and Wales have higher projected fatality levels from Covid-19 than England, whereas Northern Ireland has lower rate. Second, the infection fatality rates are projected to be substantially higher in small towns and rural areas than those in large urban areas. Third, our analysis shows that within urban regions there are also 'pockets' of high projected death rates. Overall, the areas with high and low fatality rates tend to cluster because of the high residential separation of different population age-groups in the UK. Our analysis also reveals that the Welsh-, Gaelic- and Cornish-speaking communities with relatively old populations are likely to experience heavy population losses if the virus spreads widely across the UK.",

    "abstract": "Testing is viewed as a critical aspect of any strategy to tackle epidemics. Much of the dialogue around testing has concentrated on how countries can scale up capacity, but the uncertainty in testing has not received nearly as much attention beyond asking if a test is accurate enough to be used. Even for highly accurate tests, false positives and false negatives will accumulate as mass testing strategies are employed under pressure, and these misdiagnoses could have major implications on the ability of governments to suppress the virus. The present analysis uses a modified SIR model to understand the implication and magnitude of misdiagnosis in the context of ending lockdown measures. The results indicate that increased testing capacity alone will not provide a solution to lockdown measures. The progression of the epidemic and peak infections is shown to depend heavily on test characteristics, test targeting, and prevalence of the infection. Antibody based immunity passports are rejected as a solution to ending lockdown, as they can put the population at risk if poorly targeted. Similarly, mass screening for active viral infection may only be beneficial if it can be sufficiently well targeted, otherwise reliance on this approach for protection of the population can again put them at risk. A well targeted active viral test combined with a slow release rate is a viable strategy for continuous suppression of the virus.",

    "abstract": "Background: Coronavirus (COVID-19) poses health system challenges in every country. As with any public health emergency, a major component of the global response is timely, effective science. However, particular factors specific to COVID-19 must be overcome to ensure that research efforts are optimised. We aimed to model the impact of COVID-19 on the clinical academic response in the UK, and to provide recommendations for COVID-related research. Methods: We constructed a simple stochastic model to determine clinical academic capacity in the UK in four policy approaches to COVID-19 with differing population infection rates: Italy model (6%), mitigation (10%), relaxed mitigation (40%) and do-nothing (80%) scenarios. The ability to conduct research in the COVID-19 climate is affected by the following key factors: (i) infection growth rate and population infection rate (from UK COVID-19 statistics and WHO); (ii) strain on the healthcare system (from published model); and (iii) availability of clinical academic staff with appropriate skillsets affected by frontline clinical activity and sickness (from UK statistics). Findings: In Italy model, mitigation, relaxed mitigation and do-nothing scenarios, from 5 March 2020 the duration (days) and peak infection rates (%) are 95(2.4%), 115(2.5%), 240(5.3%) and 240(16.7%) respectively. Near complete attrition of academia (87% reduction, less than 400 clinical academics) occurs 35 days after pandemic start for 11, 34, 62, 76 days respectively, with no clinical academics at all for 37 days in the do-nothing scenario. Restoration of normal academic workforce (80% of normal capacity) takes 11,12, 30 and 26 weeks respectively. Interpretation: Pandemic COVID-19 crushes the science needed at system level. National policies mitigate, but the academic community needs to adapt. We highlight six key strategies: radical prioritisation (eg 3-4 research ideas per institution), deep resourcing, non-standard leadership (repurposing of key non-frontline teams), rationalisation (profoundly simple approaches), careful site selection (eg protected sites with large academic backup) and complete suspension of academic competition with collaborative approaches.",

Second, a high number of healthcare staff are either falling ill with the infection, or self-isolating. This poses significant problems for the staffing of busy hospital departments. We have created a simple model which allows users to stress test their rota. The model provides plots of staff availability over time using either a constant infection rate, or a changing infection rate fitted to population-based infection curves. It allows users to gauge the extent and timing of dips in staff availability. The basic constant infection rate model is available within an on-line web application (https://covid19.shef.ac.uk). As for any model, our work is imperfect. However, it allows a range of infection rates to be simulated quickly across different work patterns. We hope it will be useful to those planning staff deployment and will stimulate debate on the most effective patterns of work during the COVID-19 epidemic.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: To use human genetic variants that proxy angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drug effects and cardiovascular risk factors to provide insight into how these exposures affect lung ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression and circulating ACE2 levels. Design: Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Setting: Summary-level genetic association data. Participants: Participants were predominantly of European ancestry. Variants that proxy ACE inhibitor drug effects and cardiometabolic risk factors (body mass index, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lifetime smoking index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and type 2 diabetes mellitus) were selected from publicly available genome-wide association study data (sample sizes ranging from 188,577 to 898,130 participants). Genetic association estimates for lung expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were obtained from the Gene-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project (515 participants) and the Lung eQTL Consortium (1,038 participants). Genetic association estimates for circulating plasma ACE2 levels were obtained from the INTERVAL study (4,947 participants). Main outcomes and measures: Lung ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression and plasma ACE2 levels. Results: There were no association of genetically proxied ACE inhibition with any of the outcomes considered here. There was evidence of a positive association of genetic liability to type 2 diabetes mellitus with lung ACE2 gene expression in GTEx (p = 4x10-4) and with circulating plasma ACE2 levels in INTERVAL (p = 0.03), but not with lung ACE2 expression in the Lung eQTL Consortium study (p = 0.68). There were no associations between genetically predicted levels of the other cardiometabolic traits with the outcomes. Conclusions: This study does not provide evidence to support that ACE inhibitor antihypertensive drugs affect lung ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression or plasma ACE2 levels. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, our findings do not support a change in ACE inhibitor medication use without clinical justification.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a wide array of epidemiological models has been developed to guide public health actors in containing the rapid dissemination of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), cause of COVID-19. Despite their usefulness, many epidemiological models recently developed to understand the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and infection rates of COVID-19 fall short as they ignore human mobility, limiting our understanding of the spread of the disease, together with the vulnerability of population centers in a broad scale. We developed a new temporally-explicit model and simulated several social distancing scenarios to predict the vulnerability to COVID-19 of 50 Mexican cities that are interconnected by their air transportation network. Additionally, we assessed the sufficiency of the public health infrastructure in the focal cities to face the pandemic over time. Based on our model, we show that the most important cities within the Mexican air transportation network are the most vulnerable to COVID-19, with all assessed public health infrastructure being insufficient to face the modeled scenario for the pandemic after 100 days. Despite these alarming findings, our results show that social distancing could dramatically decrease the total number of infected people (77% drop-off for the 45% distancing scenario when contrasted with no distancing), flattening the growth of infection rate. Thus, we consider that this study provides useful information that may help decision-makers to timely implement health policies to anticipate and lessen the impact of the current pandemic in Mexico.",

    "abstract": "Aims: The SARS-Cov2 virus binds to the ACE2 receptor for cell entry. It has been suggested that ACE- inhibitors (ACEi) and Angiotensin-2 Blockers (ARB), which are commonly used in patients with hypertension or diabetes and may raise ACE2 levels, could increase the risk of severe COVID19 infection. Methods and Results: We evaluated this hypothesis in a consecutive cohort of 1200 acute inpatients with COVID19 at two hospitals with a multi-ethnic catchment population in London (UK). The mean age was 68+-17 years (57% male) and 74% of patients had at least 1 comorbidity. 415 patients (34.6%) reached the primary endpoint of death or transfer to a critical care unit for organ support within 21-days of symptom onset. 399 patients (33.3 %) were taking ACEi or ARB. Patients on ACEi/ARB were significantly older and had more comorbidities. The odds ratio (OR) for the primary endpoint in patients on ACEi and ARB, after adjustment for age, sex and co-morbidities, was 0.63 (CI 0.47-0.84, p<0.01). Conclusions: There was no evidence for increased severity of COVID19 disease in hospitalised patients on chronic treatment with ACEi or ARB. A trend towards a beneficial effect of ACEi/ARB requires further evaluation in larger meta-analyses and randomised clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Cytokine storms are drivers of pathology and mortality in myriad viral infections affecting the human population. In SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, the strength of the cytokine storm has been associated with increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial damage, and death. However, the therapeutic value of attenuating the cytokine storm in COVID-19 remains to be defined. Here, we report results obtained using a novel mouse model of lethal sterile anti-viral immune responses. Using a mouse model of Down syndrome (DS) with a segmental duplication of a genomic region encoding four of the six interferon receptor genes (Ifnrs), we demonstrate that these animals overexpress Ifnrs and are hypersensitive to IFN stimulation. When challenged with viral mimetics that activate Toll-like receptor signaling and IFN anti-viral responses, these animals overproduce key cytokines, show exacerbated liver pathology, rapidly lose weight, and die. Importantly, the lethal immune hypersensitivity, accompanying cytokine storm, and liver hyperinflammation are blocked by treatment with a JAK1-specific inhibitor. Therefore, these results point to JAK1 inhibition as a potential strategy for attenuating the cytokine storm and consequent organ failure during overdrive immune responses. Additionally, these results indicate that people with DS, who carry an extra copy of the IFNR gene cluster encoded on chromosome 21, should be considered at high risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryInhibition of the JAK1 kinase prevents pathology and mortality caused by a rampant innate immune response in mice.",

    "abstract": "Importance: A strategy for preventing further spread of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic is to detect infections and isolate infected individuals without the need of extensive bio-specimen testing. Objectives: Here we investigate the prevalence of loss of smell and taste among COVID-19 diagnosed individuals and we identify the combination of symptoms, besides loss of smell and taste, most likely to correspond to a positive COVID-19 diagnosis in non-severe cases. Design: Community survey. Setting and Participants: Subscribers of RADAR COVID-19, an app that was launched for use among the UK general population asking about COVID-19 symptoms. Main Exposure: Loss of smell and taste. Main Outcome Measures: COVID-19. Results: Between 24 and 29 March 2020, 1,573,103 individuals reported their symptoms via the app; 26% reported suffering from one or more symptoms of COVID-19. Of those, n=1702 reported having had a RT-PCR COVID-19 test and gave full report on symptoms including loss of smell and taste; 579 were positive and 1123 negative. In this subset, we find that loss of smell and taste were present in 59% of COVID-19 positive individuals compared to 18% of those negative to the test, yielding an odds ratio (OR) of COVID-19 diagnosis of OR[95%CI]=6.59[5.25; 8.27], P= 1.90x10-59 . We also find that a combination of loss of smell and taste, fever, persistent cough, fatigue, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and loss of appetite is predictive of COVID-19 positive test with sensitivity 0.54[0.44; 0.63], specificity 0.86[0.80; 0.90], ROC-AUC 0.77[0.72; 0.82] in the test set, and cross-validation ROC-AUC 0.75[0.72; 0.77]. When applied to the 410,598 individuals reporting symptoms but not formally tested, our model predicted that 13.06%[12.97%;13.15] of these might have been already infected by the virus. Conclusions and Relevance: Our study suggests that loss of taste and smell is a strong predictor of having been infected by the COVID-19 virus. Also, the combination of symptoms that could be used to identify and isolate individuals includes anosmia, fever, persistent cough, diarrhoea, fatigue, abdominal pain and loss of appetite. This is particularly relevant to healthcare and other key workers in constant contact with the public who have not yet been tested for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Diagnostic assays using quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) most commonly process patient samples one by one. While this is usually an effective and reliable method, the current efforts against the COVID-19 pandemic demand more efficient measures. Diagnostic assays can be scaled up by the method of High-Throughput qPCR via sample pooling. Pooling, the action of combining multiple samples into one tube, is most effective when the chance of positive detection of the target, SARS-CoV-2 RNA, is low. In such cases, large groups of samples can be conclusively classified as negative with a single test, with no need to individually test every sample. However, different frequencies of the target-product presence in the samples, require different pool/batch sizes for optimal results. Here, we present two possible optimized pooling strategies for diagnostic SARSCoV-2 testing on large scales, each one better suited for a different range of target frequency. In the first, we employ a simple information-theoretic heuristic to derive a highly efficient re-pooling protocol: an estimate of the target frequency determines the initial pool size, and any subsequent pools found positive are re-pooled at half-size and tested again. In the range of very rare target (<0.05), this approach can reduce the number of necessary tests dramatically. For example, this method achieves a reduction of a factor of 50 for a target frequency of 0.001. The second method is a simpler approach of optimized one-time pooling followed by individual tests on positive pools. We show that this approach is just as efficient for moderate target-product frequencies (0.05<0.2). For example, it reduces the number of tests needed by half if the frequency of positives samples is 0.07. We show that both methods are comparable to the absolute upper-bound efficiency given by Shannon's source coding theorem. Our strategies require no investment at all, and they offer a significant reduction in the amount of equipment and time needed to test large numbers of samples. Both approaches are dynamic; they can be easily implemented in different conditions with various infection rates and sample numbers. We compare our strategies to the naive way of testing and also to alternative matrix methods. Most importantly, we offer practical pooling instructions for laboratories that perform large scale qPCR assays to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 viral particles.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have been published in the past few months describing the CT features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is a great degree of heterogeneity in the study designs, lesion descriptors used and conclusions derived. In our systematic analysis and meta-review, we have attempted to homogenize the reported features and provide a comprehensive view of the disease pattern and progression in different clinical stages. After an extensive literature search, we short-listed and reviewed 49 studies including over 4145 patients with 3615 RT-PCR positive cases of COVID-19 disease. We have found that there is a good agreement among these studies that diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) is the most common finding at all stages of the disease followed by consolidations and mixed density lesions. 78% of patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infections had either ground-glass opacities, consolidation or both. Inter-lobular septal thickening was also found to be a common feature in many patients in advanced stages. The progression of these initial patchy ground-glass opacities and consolidations to diffuse lesions with septal thickening, air bronchograms in the advanced stages, to either diffuse white-out lungs needing ICU admissions or finally resolving completely without or with residual fibrotic strips was also found to be congruent among multiple studies. Prominent juxta-lesional pulmonary vessels, pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy in RT-PCR proven cases were found to have poor clinical prognosis. Additionally, we noted wide variation in terminology used to describe lesions across studies and suggest the use of standardized lexicons to describe findings related to diseases of vital importance.",

    "abstract": "Background The pandemic spread of COVID-19 has caused worldwide implications on societies and economies. Chest computed tomography (CT) has been found to support both, current diagnostic and disease monitoring. A joint approach to collect, analyze and share clinical and imaging information about COVID-19 in the highest quality possible is urgently needed. Methods An evidence-based reporting template was developed for assessing COVID-19 pneumonia using an FDA-approved medical software. The annotation of qualitative and quantitative findings including radiomics features is performed directly on primary imaging data. For data collection, secondary information from the patient history and clinical data such as symptoms and comorbidities are queried. Results License-royalty free, cloud-based web platform and on-premise deployments are offered. Hospitals can upload, assess, report and if pseudonymized share their COVID-19 cases. The aggregation of radiomics in correlation with rt-PCR, patient history, clinical and radiological findings, systematically documented in a single database, will lead to optimized diagnosis, risk stratification and response evaluation. A customizable analytics dashboard allows the explorative real-time data analysis of imaging features and clinical information. Conclusions The COVID-19-Template is based on a systematic, computer-assisted and context-guided approach to collect, analyze and share data. Epidemiological and clinical studies for therapies and vaccine candidates can be implemented in compliance with high data quality, integrity and traceability.",

    "abstract": "The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a major shortage of N95 respirators, which are essential to protecting healthcare professionals and the general public who may come into contact with the virus. Thus, it is essential to determine how we can reuse respirators and other personal protection in these urgent times. We investigated multiple commonly used and easily deployable, scalable disinfection schemes on media with particle filtration efficiency of 95%. Among these, heating ([&le;]85 {degrees}C) under various humidities ([&le;]100% RH) was the most promising, nondestructive method for the preservation of filtration properties in meltblown fabrics as well as N95-grade respirators. Heating can be applied up to 50 cycles (85 {degrees}C, 30% RH) without observation in the degradation of meltblown filtration performance. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation was a secondary choice which was able to withstand 10 cycles of treatment and showed small degradation by 20 cycles. However, UV can also potentially impact the material strength and fit of respirators. Finally, treatments involving liquids and vapors require caution, as steam, alcohol, and household bleach may all lead to degradation of the filtration efficiency, leaving the user vulnerable to the viral aerosols.",

    "abstract": "Background: On December 2019, Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was detected in Wuhan, China, and then spread around the world. There is little information about effects of COVID-19 on Pregnant women and newborns as a sensitive population. The current study is a systemic review and Meta-analysis to measure the risks and determine the presentations of COVID-19 in pregnant women and newborn. Methods: online data bases were searched on march 20. Heterogeneity of the included studies was assessed using the Cochran Q test and Higgins I2 statistic and expressed as percentage. All data were analyzed with 95% confidence intervals. Results: A total of 7 studies involving 50 participants with Positive test of COVID-19 were enrolled. Mean age of pregnant women was 30.57 years old and the Mean Gestational age was 36.9 weeks. Other variables such as Apgar score, birth weight, Sign and symptoms, Complications and Laboratory data were Analyzed. Conclusion: Our findings showed same clinical characteristics in pregnant women as in non-pregnant adults, with the main symptoms being cough and fever. No vertical transmission was seen and all patients delivered healthy neonates. Our findings would be of great help to the decision making process, regarding the management of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Information is the most potent protective weapon we have to combat a pandemic, at both the individual and global level. For individuals, information can help us make personal decisions and provide a sense of security. For the global community, information can inform policy decisions and offer critical insights into the epidemic of COVID-19 disease. Fully leveraging the power of information, however, requires large amounts of data and access to it. To achieve this, we are making steps to form an international consortium, Coronavirus Census Collective (CCC, coronaviruscensuscollective.org), that will serve as a hub for integrating information from multiple data sources that can be utilized to understand, monitor, predict, and combat global pandemics. These sources may include self-reported health status through surveys (including mobile apps), results of diagnostic laboratory tests, and other static and real-time geospatial data. This collective effort to track and share information will be invaluable in predicting hotspots of disease outbreak, identifying which factors control the rate of spreading, informing immediate policy decisions, evaluating the effectiveness of measures taken by health organizations on pandemic control, and providing critical insight on the etiology of COVID-19. It will also help individuals stay informed on this rapidly evolving situation and contribute to other global efforts to slow the spread of disease. In the past few weeks, several initiatives across the globe have surfaced to use daily self-reported symptoms as a means to track disease spread, predict outbreak locations, guide population measures and help in the allocation of healthcare resources. The aim of this paper is to put out a call to standardize these efforts and spark a collaborative effort to maximize the global gain while protecting participant privacy.",

    "abstract": "While mortality attributable to COVID-19 has devastated global health systems and economies, striking regional differences have been observed. The Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine has previously been shown to have non-specific protective effects on infections, as well as long-term efficacy against tuberculosis. Using publicly available data we built a simple log-linear regression model to assess the association of BCG use and COVID-19-attributable mortality per 1 million population after adjusting for confounders including country economic status (GDP per capita), and proportion of elderly among the population. The timing of country entry into the pandemic epidemiological trajectory was aligned by plotting time since the 100th reported case. Countries with economies classified as lower-middle-income, upper-middle-income and high-income countries (LMIC, UMIC, HIC) had median crude COVID-19 log-mortality of 0.4 (Interquartile Range (IQR) 0.1, 0.4), 0.7 (IQR 0.2, 2.2) and 5.5 (IQR 1.6, 13.9), respectively. COVID-19-attributable mortality among BCG-using countries was 5.8 times lower [95% CI 1.8-19.0] than in non BCG-using countries. Notwithstanding limitations due to testing constraints in LMICs, case ascertainment bias and a plausible rise of cases as countries progress along the epidemiological trajectory, these analyses provide intriguing observations that urgently warrant mobilization of resources for prospective randomized interventional studies and institution of systematic disease surveillance, particularly in LMICs.",

    "abstract": "The current pandemic of COVID-19 has lead to conflicting opinions on whether wearing facemasks outside of health care facilities protects against the infection. To better understand the value of wearing facemasks we undertook a rapid systematic review of existing scientific evidence about development of respiratory illness, linked to use of facemasks in community settings. METHODS: We included all study designs. There were 31 eligible studies (including 12 RCTs). Narrative synthesis and random-effects meta-analysis of attack rates for primary and secondary prevention in 28 studies were performed. Results were reported by design, setting and type of face barrier in primary prevention, and by who wore the facemask (index patient or well contacts) in secondary prevention trials. The preferred outcome was influenza-like illness (ILI) but similar outcomes were pooled with ILI when ILI was unavailable. GRADE quality assessment was based on RCTs with support from observational studies. RESULTS: Where specific information was available, most studies reported about use of medical grade (surgical paper masks). In 3 RCTs, wearing a facemask may very slightly reduce the odds of developing ILI/respiratory symptoms, by around 6% (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.19, I2 29%, low certainty evidence). Greater effectiveness was suggested by observational studies. When both house-mates and an infected household member wore facemasks the odds of further household members becoming ill may be modestly reduced by around 19% (OR 0.81, 95%CI 0.48 to 1.37, I 2 45%, 5 RCTs, low certainty evidence). The protective effect was very small if only the well person(OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.28, I2 11%, 2 RCTs, low uncertainty evidence) or the infected person wore the facemask (very low certainty evidence). DISCUSSION: Based on the RCTs we would conclude that wearing facemasks can be very slightly protective against primary infection from casual community contact, and modestly protective against household infections when both infected and uninfected members wear facemasks. However, the RCTs often suffered from poor compliance and controls using facemasks. Across observational studies the evidence in favour of wearing facemasks was stronger. We expect RCTs to under-estimate the protective effect and observational studies to exaggerate it. The evidence is not sufficiently strong to support widespread use of facemasks as a protective measure against COVID-19. However, there is enough evidence to support the use of facemasks for short periods of time by particularly vulnerable individuals when in transient higher risk situations. Further high quality trials are needed to assess when wearing a facemask in the community is most likely to be protective.",

    "abstract": "Since Dec 2019, the COVID-19 epidemic has spread over the globe creating one of the greatest pandemics ever witnessed. This epidemic wave will only begin to roll back once a critical proportion of the population is immunised, either by mounting natural immunity following infection, or by vaccination. The latter option can minimise the cost in terms of human lives but it requires to wait until a safe and efficient vaccine is developed, a period estimated to last at least 18 months. In this work, we use optimal control theory to explore the best strategy to implement while waiting for the vaccine. We seek a solution minimizing deaths and costs due to the implementation of the control strategy itself. We find that such a solution leads to an increasing level of control with a maximum reached near the 16th month of the epidemics and a steady decrease until vaccine deployment. The average containment level is approximately 50\\% during the 25-months period for vaccine deployment. This strategy strongly outperforms others with constant or cycling allocations of the same amount of resources to control the outbreak. This work opens new perspectives to mitigate the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics, and be used as a proof-of-concept in using mathematical modelling techniques to enlighten decision making and public health management in the early times of an outbreak.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 (Corona Virus) is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-COV-2). The virus that was first discovered in China Wuhan Province about 3 months ago (first cases were reported in Wuhan on December 31st, 2019) has spread world wide. The six (6) top countries (excluding China) most affected so far include; USA, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, and Iran. With Italy showing the highest death toll. In Uganda where it was discovered on 19/3/2020 with one (01) case has just in nine (9) days, increased to thirty (30) infected individuals. This model is a wake-up call over the rate at which COVID-19 is likely to spread throughout the country. Thus it is a guide for policymakers and planners to benchmark on for solutions to this deadly virus.",

    "abstract": "At the end of March 2020, there were in excess of 800.000 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide. Several reports suggest that, in severe cases, COVID-19 may cause a hyperinflammatory 'cytokine storm'. However, unlike SARS-CoV infection, high levels of anti-inflammatory mediators have also been reported in COVID-19 patients. One study reported that 16% of COVID-19 patients who died developed secondary infection, which might indicate an immune-suppressed state. We explored kinetics of mHLA-DR expression, the most widely used marker of innate immune suppression in critically ill patients, in COVID- 19 patients admitted to the ICU. Twenty-four confirmed COVID-19 patients were included, of which 75% was male and 79% had comorbidities. All patients were mechanically ventilated and exhibited large high levels of inflammatory parameters such as CRP and PCT. Although mHLA-DR expression levels in COVID-19 patients were lower than those observed in healthy subjects, the extent of suppression was less pronounced than observed in bacterial septic shock patients. mHLA-DR expression kinetics revealed no change over time. None of the COVID-19 patients developed a secondary infection. In conclusion, despite a pronounced inflammatory response, mHLA-DR expression kinetics indicate more moderate innate immune suppression in COVID-19 patients compared with bacterial septic shock patients. These data signify that innate immune suppression as a negative feedback mechanism following PAMP-induced inflammation appears less pronounced in COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate aerosol-spread in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) using different methods of airway management. Knowledge about Aerosol spread is vital during the SARS-CoV-2-Pandemic. Methods: To evaluate feasibility we nebulized ultraviolet sensitive detergents into the artificial airway of a resuscitation dummy and performed CPR. The spread of the visualized aerosol was documented by a camera. In a second approach we applied nebulized detergents into human cadavers by an endotracheal tube and detected aerosol- spread during chest compressions the same way. We did recordings with undergoing compression- only-CPR, with a surgical mask and with an inserted laryngeal tube with and without a connected airway filter. Results: Most aerosol-spread at the direction of the provider was visualized during compression-only-CPR. The use of a surgical mask deflected the spread. Inserting a laryngeal tube connected to an airway filter lead to a remarkable reduction of aerosol-spread. Conclusion: The early insertion of a laryngeal tube connected to an airway filter before starting chest compression may be good for two Things: the treatment of hypoxemia as the likeliest cause of cardiac arrest and for staff protection during CPR.",

    "abstract": "Due to the recent diffusion of COVID-19 outbreak, the scientific community is making efforts in analysing models for understanding the present situation and predicting future scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Susceptible-Infected-Exposed-Recovered-Dead (SEIRD) differential model [Weitz J. S. and Dushoff J., Scientific reports, 2015] for the analysis and forecast of the COVID-19 spread in Italian regions, using the data from the Italian Protezione Civile from February 24th 2020. In this study, we investigate an adaptation of SEIRD that takes into account the actual policies of the Italian government, consisting of modelling the infection rate as a time-dependent function (SEIRD(rm)). Preliminary results on Lombardia and Emilia-Romagna regions confirm that SEIRD(rm) fits the data more accurately than the original SEIRD model with constant rate infection parameter. Moreover, the increased flexibility in the choice of the infection rate function makes it possible to better control the predictions due to the lockdown policy.",

    "abstract": "Background: Although by late February 2020 the COVID-19 epidemic was effectively controlled in Wuhan, China, the virus has since spread around the world and been declared a pandemic on March 11. Estimating the effects of interventions, such as transportation restrictions and quarantine measures, on the early COVID-19 transmission dynamics in Wuhan is critical for guiding future virus containment strategies. Since the exact number of COVID-19 infected cases is unknown, the number of documented cases was used by many disease transmission models to infer epidemiological parameters. However, this means that it would not be possible to adequately estimate epidemiological parameters and the effects of intervention measures, because the percentage of all infected cases that were documented changed during the first 2 months of the epidemic as a consequence of a gradually increasing diagnostic capability. Methods: To overcome the limitations, we constructed a stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) model, accounting for intervention measures and temporal changes in the proportion of new documented infections out of total new infections, to characterize the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan across different stages of the outbreak. Pre-symptomatic transmission was taken into account in our model, and all epidemiological parameters were estimated using Particle Markov-chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) method. Results: Our model captured the local Wuhan epidemic pattern as a two-peak transmission dynamics, with one peak on February 4 and the other on February 12, 2020. The impact of intervention measures determined the timing of the first peak, leading to an 86% drop in the R_e from 3.23 (95% CI, 2.22 to 4.20) to 0.45 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.69). An improved diagnostic capability led to the second peak and a higher proportion of documented infections. Our estimated proportion of new documented infections out of the total new infections increased from 11% (95% CI 1% - 43%) to 28% (95% CI 4% - 62%) after January 26 when more detection kits were released. After the introduction of a new diagnostic criterion (case definition) on February 12, a higher proportion of daily infected cases were documented (49% (95% CI 7% - 79%)).",

    "abstract": "Concerning the two approaches to the Covid-19 case mortality rate published in the literature, namely computing the ratio of (a) the daily number of deaths to a time delayed daily number of confirmed infections; and (b) the cumulative number of deaths to confirmed infections up to a certain time, both numbers having been acquired in the middle of an outbreak, it is shown that each suffers from systematic error of a different source. We further show that in the absence of detailed knowledge of the time delay distribution of (a), the true case mortality rate is obtained by pursuing method (b) at the end of the outbreak when the fate of every case has decisively been rendered. The approach is then employed to calculate the mean case mortality rate of 13 regions of China where every case has already been resolved. This leads to a mean rate of 0.527 +/- 0.001 %.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: The extent to which people implement government-issued protective measures is critical in preventing further spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Our study aimed to evaluate the public belief in the effectiveness of protective measures, the reported implementation of these measures in daily life, and to identify communication channels used to acquire relevant information on COVID-19 in European countries. Design: A cross-sectional online survey available in multiple languages was disseminated on social media starting March 19th, 2020. After five days, we computed descriptive statistics for countries with more than 500 respondents. Each day, we compiled and categorized community containment measures enacted in each country by stringency (stage I-IV). Response collection continued for one week to explore possible dynamics as containment strategies intensified. Participants: In total, 9,796 adults responded, of whom 8,611 resided in the Netherlands (stage III), 604 in Germany (stage III), and 581 in Italy (stage IV). An additional 1,365 respondents completed the survey in the following week. Results: Participants indicated support for governmental measures related to avoiding social gatherings, selective closure of public places, and hand hygiene and respiratory measures (range for all measures: 95.0%-99.7%). Respondents from the Netherlands were less likely to consider a complete social lockdown effective (59.2%), compared to respondents in Germany (76.6%) or Italy (87.2%). Italian residents did not only apply enforced social distancing measures more frequently (range: 90.2%-99.3%, German and Dutch residents: 67.5%-97.0%), but also self-initiated hygienic and social distancing behaviors (range: 36.3%-96.6%, German and Dutch residents: 28.3%-95.7%). Respondents largely reported being sufficiently informed about the COVID-19 outbreak and about behaviors to avoid infection (range across countries: 90.2%-91.1%). Information channels most commonly reported included television (range: 53.0%-82.0%), newspapers (range: 31.0%-63.0%), official health websites (range: 39.0%-54.1%), and social media (range: 40.0%-55.8%). We observed no major changes in answers over time. Conclusions: In European countries, the degree of public belief in the effectiveness of protective measures was high and residents reported to be sufficiently informed by various communication channels. In March 2020, implementation of enacted and self-initiated measures differed between countries and were highest among Italian respondents, who were subjected to the most elaborate measures of social lockdown and greatest COVID-19 burden in Europe.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To estimate surge capacities and demands of Brazil's health system in view of severe cases of the novel coronavirus disease. Methods: Three types of hospital equipments demanded by severe COVID-19 patients are considered: available intensive care unit (ICU) beds, existing surgery operating rooms and respirators located in other hospital areas. They are taken into account on a cumulative basis forming three levels of hospital equipment usage. Based on a mean duration of hospitalization for the disease, it is estimated the daily admission capacity of infected patients per state and for the entire country for each level of hospital equipment usage. Furthermore, an exponential regression model is fitted by means of the daily national number of new documented patients. The prediction intervals for the number of new patients for certain days in the immediate future are then calculated and compared to the admissible daily demand for the three incremental groups of equipments. The data are made publicly available by the Brazilian federal government and are gathered and analyzed by means of the Python programming language. Results: 41% of the (adult) ICU beds in Brazil were available during 2019, indicating that this hospital equipment has not been on average operating near capacity in national numbers. Nevertheless, there is a marked heterogeneity in the absolute and relative numbers of available and existing ICU beds and existing surgery operating rooms and extra respirators between its states. Conclusions: The remarkable differences between states' hospital resources directly reflect into the number of possible daily admissions of COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure for the three considered levels of hospital equipment usage. In national numbers, Brazil's health system is estimated to be capable of daily admitting 693, 1243 and 2166 severe patients under the three studied scenarios. The fitted model predicted that only the first limit, if any, would be reached.",

    "abstract": "We present a stochastic optimization model for allocating and sharing a critical resource in the case of a pandemic. The demand for different entities peaks at different times, and an initial inventory for a central agency is to be allocated. The entities (states) may share the critical resource with a different state under a risk-averse condition. The model is applied to study the allocation of ventilator inventory in the COVID-19 pandemic by FEMA to different US states. Findings suggest that if less than 60\\% of the ventilator inventory is available for non-COVID-19 patients, FEMA's stockpile of 20,000 ventilators (as of 03/23/2020) would be nearly adequate to meet the projected needs in slightly above average demand scenarios. However, when more than 75\\% of the available ventilator inventory must be reserved for non-COVID-19 patients, various degrees of shortfall are expected. In a severe case, where the demand is concentrated in the top-most quartile of the forecast confidence interval and states are not willing to share their stockpile of ventilators, the total shortfall over the planning horizon (till 05/31/20) is about 232,000 ventilator days, with a peak shortfall of 17,200 ventilators on 04/19/2020.",

    "abstract": "Background: Estimating the prevalence of severe or critical illness and case fatality of COVID-19 outbreak in December, 2019 remains a challenge due to biases associated with surveillance, data synthesis and reporting. We aimed to address this limitation in a systematic review and meta-analysis and to examine the clinical, biochemical and radiological risk factors in a meta-regression. Methods: PRISMA guidelines were followed. PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched using pre-specified keywords on March 07, 2020. Peer-reviewed empirical studies examining rates of severe illness, critical illness and case fatality among COVID-19 patients were examined. Numerators and denominators to compute the prevalence rates and risk factors were extracted. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed. Results were corrected for publication bias. Meta-regression analyses examined the moderator effects of potential risk factors. Results: The meta-analysis included 29 studies representing 2,090 individuals. Pooled rates of severe illness, critical illness and case fatality among COVID-19 patients were 15%, 5% and 0.8% respectively. Adjusting for potential underreporting and publication bias, increased these estimates to 26%, 16% and 7.4% respectively. Increasing age and elevated LDH consistently predicted severe / critical disease and case fatality. Hypertension; fever and dyspnea at presentation; and elevated CRP predicted increased severity. Conclusions: Risk factors that emerged in our analyses predicting severity and case fatality should inform clinicians to define endophenotypes possessing a greater risk. Estimated case fatality rate of 7.4% after correcting for publication bias underscores the importance of strict adherence to preventive measures, case detection, surveillance and reporting.",

    "abstract": "With sensitivity of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test used to detect the presence of the virus in the human host, the global health community has been able to record a great number of recovered population. Therefore, in a bid to answer a burning question of reinfection in the recovered class, the model equations which exhibits the disease-free equilibrium (E_0 ) state for COVID-19 coronavirus was developed in this study and was discovered to both exist as well as satisfy the criteria for a locally or globally asymptotic stability with a basic reproductive number R_0=0 for and endemic situation. Hence, there is a chance of no secondary reinfections from the recovered population as the rate of incidence of the recovered population vanishes, that is, B=0. Furthermore, numerical simulations were carried to complement the analytical results in investigating the effect of the implementation of quarantine and observatory procedures has on the projection of the further spread of the virus globally. Result shows that the proportion of infected population in the absence of curative vaccination will continue to grow globally meanwhile the recovery rate will continue slowly which therefore means that the ratio of infection to recovery rate will determine the death rate that is recorded globally and most significant for this study is the rate of reinfection by the recovered population which will decline to zero over time as the virus is cleared clinically from the system of the recovered class.",

    "abstract": "Objectives To establish the optimal parameters for group testing of pooled specimens for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Methods The most efficient pool size was determined to be 5 specimens using a web-based application. From this analysis, 25 experimental pools were created using 50 microliter from one SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal specimen mixed with 4 negative patient specimens (50 microliter each) for a total volume of 250 microliter l. Viral RNA was subsequently extracted from each pool and tested using the CDC SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. Positive pools were consequently split into individual specimens and tested by extraction and PCR. This method was also tested on an unselected group of 60 nasopharyngeal specimens grouped into 12-pools. Results All 25 pools were positive with Cycle threshold (Ct) values within 0 and 5.03 Ct of the original individual specimens. The analysis of 60 specimens determined that two pools were positive followed by identification of two individual specimens among the 60 tested. This testing was accomplished while using 22 extractions/PCR tests, a savings of 38 reactions. Conclusions When the incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection is 10% or less, group testing will result in the saving of reagents and personnel time with an overall increase in testing capability of at least 69%.",

    "abstract": "Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly respiratory infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) with multiple organ injuries. The aim of this study was to analyze SARS-CoV-2-induced acute liver injury (ALI), its association with death risk and prognosis after discharge. Methods: Three-hundred and fifty-five COVID-19 patients were recruited. Clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. ALI was evaluated and its prognosis was tracked. The association between ALI and death risk was analyzed. Results: Of 355 COVID-19 patients, 211 were common, 88 severe, and 51 critical ill cases, respectively. On admission, 223 (62.8%) patients were with hypoproteinemia, 151(42.5%) with cholestasis, and 101 (28.5%) with hepatocellular injury. As expected, ALI was more common in critical ill patients. By multivariate logistic regression, male, older age and lymphocyte reduction were three important independent risk factors predicting ALI among COVID-19 patients. Death risk analysis shows that fatality rate was higher among patients with hypoproteinemia than those without hypoproteinemia (RR=9.471, P<0.001). Moreover, fatality rate was higher among patients with cholestasis than those without cholestasis (RR=2.182, P<0.05). Follow-up observation found that more than one hepatic functional indexes of two-third patients remained abnormal 14 days after discharge. Conclusions: ALI at early stage elevates death risk of COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI has not recovered completely 14 days after discharge.",

    "abstract": "Background and objective: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been pandemic worldwide. Several reports observed a reduction of lymphocytes among COVID-19 patients. However, clinical significance of lymphocyte reduction in COVID-19 patients remains unclear. The objective of this study was to analyze the association between lymphocyte reduction at early stage and the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Methods: All 192 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Electronic medical records, including demographic data, clinical characteristics, comorbidities and exposure history, were collected. Biochemical indexes on admission and chest computed tomography (CT) were detected. Patient's prognosis was followed up. Results: On admission, 84 (43.8%) patients suffered from lymphocyte reduction among COVID-19 patients. The count and percentage of lymphocytes on admission were lower among more than seventy-year-old patients than those of younger patients. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that older age was a risk factor of lymphocyte reduction. Of interest, chest CT score, a key marker of lung injury, was increased among COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction. By contrast, PaCO2, SpO2 and oxygenation index, several respiratory function markers, were decreased in COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction. Moreover, TBIL and DBIL, two markers of hepatic injury, creatinine and urea nitrogen, two indices of renal function, and creatine kinase, AST and LDH, three myocardial enzymes, were elevated in COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction. Among 84 COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction, 32.1% died. Fatality rate was obviously higher in COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction than those with normal lymphocyte (RR=5.789, P<0.001). Conclusion: Older COVID-19 patients are more susceptible to lymphocyte reduction. Lymphocyte reduction at early stage aggravates the severity of multiple organ injuries and elevates death risk of COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness of eye protection, face masks, or person distancing on interrupting or reducing the spread of respiratory viruses. DESIGN: Update of a Cochrane review that included a meta-analysis of observational studies during the SARS outbreak of 2003. DATA SOURCES: Eligible trials from the previous review; search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase and CINAHL from October 2010 up to 1 April 2020; and forward and backward citation analysis. DATA SELECTION: Randomised and cluster-randomised trials of people of any age, testing the use of eye protection, face masks, or person distancing against standard practice, or a similar physical barrier. Outcomes included any acute respiratory illness and its related consequences. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Six authors independently assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool and extracted data. We used a generalised inverse variance method for pooling using a random-effects model and reported results with risk ratios and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). RESULTS: We included 15 randomised trials investigating the effect of masks (14 trials) in healthcare workers and the general population and of quarantine (1 trial). We found no trials testing eye protection. Compared to no masks there was no reduction of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases (Risk Ratio 0.93, 95%CI 0.83 to 1.05) or influenza (Risk Ratio 0.84, 95%CI 0.61-1.17) for masks in the general population, nor in healthcare workers (Risk Ratio 0.37, 95%CI 0.05 to 2.50). There was no difference between surgical masks and N95 respirators: for ILI (Risk Ratio 0.83, 95%CI 0.63 to 1.08), for influenza (Risk Ratio 1.02, 95%CI 0.73 to 1.43). Harms were poorly reported and limited to discomfort with lower compliance. The only trial testing quarantining workers with household ILI contacts found a reduction in ILI cases, but increased risk of quarantined workers contracting influenza. All trials were conducted during seasonal ILI activity. CONCLUSIONS: Most included trials had poor design, reporting and sparse events. There was insufficient evidence to provide a recommendation on the use of facial barriers without other measures. We found insufficient evidence for a difference between surgical masks and N95 respirators and limited evidence to support effectiveness of quarantine. Based on observational evidence from the previous SARS epidemic included in the previous version of our Cochrane review we recommend the use of masks combined with other measures.",

    "abstract": "RAPID COMMUNICATION 22 March 2020 Estimating excess 1- year mortality from COVID-19 according to underlying conditions and age in England: a rapid analysis using NHS health records in 3.8 million adults Background: The medical, health service, societal and economic impact of the COVID-19 emergency has unknown effects on overall population mortality. Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom (to date at least) have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high risk conditions or their longer term background (pre-COVID-19) mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence rates and differing mortality impacts. Methods: Using population based linked primary and secondary care electronic health records in England (HDR UK - CALIBER), we report the prevalence of underlying conditions defined by UK Public Health England COVID-19 guidelines (16 March 2020) in 3,862,012 individuals aged [&ge;]30 years from 1997-2017. We used previously validated phenotypes, openly available (https://caliberresearch.org/portal), for each condition using ICD-10 diagnosis, Read, procedure and medication codes. We estimated the 1-year mortality in each condition, and developed simple models of excess COVID-19-related deaths assuming relative risk (RR) of the impact of the emergency (compared to background mortality) of 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0. Findings: 20.0% of the population are at risk according to current PHE guidelines, of which; 13.7% were age>70 years and 6.3% aged [&le;]70 years with [&ge;]1 underlying condition (cardiovascular disease (2.3%), diabetes (2.2%), steroid therapy (1.9%), severe obesity (0.9%), chronic kidney disease (0.6%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD (0.5%). Multimorbidity (co-occurrence of [&ge;]2 conditions in an individual) was common (10.1%). The 1-year mortality in the at-risk population was 4.46%, and age and underlying conditions combine to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions (5.9% in age>70 years, 8.6% for COPD and 13.1% in those with [&ge;]3 or more conditions). In a suppression scenario (at SARS CoV2 rates of 0.001% of the UK population), there would be minimal excess deaths (3 and 7 excess deaths at relative risk, RR, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). At SARS CoV2 rates of 10% of the UK population (mitigation) the model estimates the numbers of excess deaths as: 13791, 34479 and 68957 (at RR 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). At SARS CoV2 rates of 80% in the UK population (do-nothing), the model estimates the number of excess deaths as 110332, 275,830 and 551,659 (at RR 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0) respectively. Interpretation: We provide the public, researchers and policy makers a simple model to estimate the excess mortality over 1 year from COVID-19, based on underlying conditions at different ages. If the relative mortality impact of COVID-19 were to be about 20% (similar magnitude as the established winter vs summer mortality excess), then the excess deaths would be 0 when 1 in 100 000 (suppression), 13791 when 1 in 10 (mitigation) and 110332 when 8 in 10 are infected (do nothing) scenario. However, the relative impact of COVID-19 is unknown. If the emergency were to double the mortality risk, then we estimate 7, 68957 and 551,659 excess deaths in the same scenarios. These results may inform the need for more stringent suppression measures as well as efforts to target those at highest risk for a range of preventive interventions.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionAs the COVID-19 pandemic spreads globally, public health guidance is advising all workers to work from home. However, not all workers are employed in occupations which can be done from home. These workers are at an increased risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2due to increased interaction with the public and other workers, and also potentially at an increased risk for job displacement as more extreme public health measures (such as closing of retail operations or enforcing shelter in place) occur.\n\nMethodsTo characterize the occupations least likely to be able to work from home, national employment and wage data maintained by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was merged with measures from the BLS O*NET survey data, which ranks occupations by a variety of physical, ergonomic, psychosocial, and structural exposures. Noting that the work that could most easily be done at home would be work done on a computer that does not rely on interaction with the public, O*NET measures quantifying the importance of computer use at work, and the importance of working with or performing for the public at work were utilized.\n\nResultsFrom this analysis, 19.5% (28.2 M) of the United States workforce covered by O*NET are employed in occupations where working from home would be difficult, due to minimal use of computer at work, and a high level of interaction with the public. These workers tend to be in service occupations, including retail and food service, protective service occupations, and transportation occupations such as bus drivers. About 25% (35.6 M) of the United States workforce covered by O*NET are employed in occupations where working from home could likely be more easily accommodated, as these workers do much of their work on computers and interaction with the public is not important. These workers tend to be in technology, computer, management, administrative, financial, engineering, and some science occupations, which typically have higher pay than occupations which cannot be done at home.\n\nConclusionsThe workers in occupations that have minimal computer use, and high interaction with the public are least likely to be able to work from home during a public health emergency. These workers could also be at an increased risk for job displacement if public-facing establishments close or alter their business model in the face of increased public health restrictions. Occupations where working from home is not possible tend to have lower annual median incomes than occupations where working from home is possible, increasing the vulnerability of these workers.\n\nCharacterizing which occupational groups are least likely to be able to work from home can inform public health risk management and prioritize occupational sectors where additional workplace protections are necessary.",

    "abstract": "Background A pandemic of 2019 novel corona virus disease (COVID-19), which was first reported in Wuhan city, has affected more than 100,000 patients worldwide. Patients with cancer are at a higher risk of COVID-19, but currently, there is no guidance on the management of cancer patients during this outbreak. Here, we report the infection control measures and early outcomes of patients who received radiotherapy (RT) at a tertiary cancer centre in Wuhan. Methods We reviewed all patients who were treated at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (ZHWU) from Jan 20 to Mar 6, 2020. This preceded the city lock-down date of Jan 23, 2020. Infection control measures were implemented, which included a clinical pathway for managing suspect COVID-19 cases, on-site screening, modifications to the RT facility, and protection of healthcare workers. Primary end-point was infection rate among patients and healthcare staff. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the 5th edition criteria. Findings 209 patients completed RT during the study period. Median age was 55 y (IQR = 48-64). Thoracic, head and neck, and lower gastrointestinal and gynaecological cancer patients consisted the majority of patients. Treatment sites included thoracic (38.3%), head and neck (25.4%), and abdomen and pelvis (25.8%); 47.4%, 27.3%, and 25.4% of treatments were for adjuvant, radical, and palliative indications, respectively. 188 treatments/day were performed prior to the lock-down, in contrast to 12.4 treatments/day post-lock-down. Only one (0.48%) patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period. No healthcare worker was infected. Interpretation Herein, we show that in a susceptible population to COVID-19, strict infection control measures can curb human-to-human transmission, and ensure timely delivery of RT to cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), started in China in January, 2020, repurposing approved drugs is emerging as important therapeutic options. We reported here the first clinical study using hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor, danoprevir, to treat COVID-19 patients. Danoprevir (Ganovo) is a potent HCV protease (NS3/4A) inhibitor (IC50 = 0.29 nM), which was approved and marketed in China since 2018 to treat chronic hepatitis C patients. Ritonavir is a CYP3A4 inhibitor to enhance plasma concentration of danoprevir while it also acts as a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor at high doses. The chymotrypsin-like protease of SARS-CoV-2 shares structure similarity with HCV and HIV proteases. In the current clinical study (NCT04291729) conducted at the Nineth Hospital of Nanchang, we evaluated therapeutic effects of danoprevir, boosted by ritonavir, on treatment naive and experienced COVID-19 patients. The data from this small-sample clinical study showed that danoprevir boosted by ritonavir is safe and well tolerated in all patients. After 4 to 12-day treatment of danoprevir boosted by ritonavir, all eleven patients enrolled, two naive and nine experienced, were discharged from the hospital as they met all four conditions as follows: (1) normal body temperature for at least 3 days; (2) significantly improved respiratory symptoms; (3) lung imaging shows obvious absorption and recovery of acute exudative lesion; and (4) two consecutive RT-PCR negative tests of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide acid (respiratory track sampling with interval at least one day). Our findings suggest that repurposing danoprevir for COVID-19 is a promising therapeutic option.",

    "abstract": "This study shows that the disease free equilibrium (E_0 ) for COVID-19 coronavirus does not satisfy the criteria for a locally or globally asymptotic stability. This implies that as a pandemic as declared by WHO (2020) the COVID-19 coronavirus does not have a curative vaccine yet and precautionary measures are advised through quarantine and observatory procedures. Also, the Basic Reproductive number (R_0<1) by Equation (33) shows that there is a chance of decline of secondary infections when the ratio between the incidence rate in the population and the total number of infected population quarantined with observatory procedure. The effort to evaluate the disease equilibrium shows that unless there is a dedicated effort from government, decision makers and stakeholders, the world would hardly be reed of the COVID-19 coronavirus and further spread is eminent and the rate of infection will continue to increase despite the increased rate of recovery because of the absence of vaccine at the moment.",

    "abstract": "One of the greatest threats to humanity is the emergence of a pandemic virus. Among those with the greatest potential for such an event include influenza viruses and coronaviruses. In the last century alone, we have observed four major influenza A virus pandemics as well as the emergence of three highly pathogenic coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As no effective antiviral treatments or vaccines are presently available against SARS-CoV-2, it is important to understand the host response to this virus as this may guide the efforts in development towards novel therapeutics. Here, we offer the first in-depth characterization of the host transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections through in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo model systems. Our data demonstrate the each virus elicits both core antiviral components as well as unique transcriptional footprints. Compared to the response to influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV-2 elicits a muted response that lacks robust induction of a subset of cytokines including the Type I and Type III interferons as well as a numerous chemokines. Taken together, these data suggest that the unique transcriptional signature of this virus may be responsible for the development of COVID-19.",
