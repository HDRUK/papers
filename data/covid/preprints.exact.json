    "abstract": "Enhanced community surveillance is a key pillar of the public health response to COVID-19. Asymptomatic carriage of SARS-CoV-2 is a potentially significant source of transmission, yet remains relatively poorly understood. Disruption of dental services continues with significantly reduced capacity. Ongoing precautions include pre- and/or at appointment COVID-19 symptom screening and use of enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE). This study aimed to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection in dental patients to inform community surveillance and improve understanding of risks in the dental setting. Thirty-one dental care centres across Scotland invited asymptomatic screened patients over 5-years-old to participate. Following verbal consent and completion of sociodemographic and symptom history questionnaire, trained dental teams took a combined oropharyngeal and nasal swab sample using standardised VTM-containing testkits. Samples were processed by the Lighthouse Lab and patients informed of their results by SMS/e-mail with appropriate self-isolation guidance in the event of a positive test. Over a 13-week period (from 3August to 31October2020) n=4,032 patients, largely representative of the population, were tested. Of these n=22 (0.5%; 95%CI 0.5%, 0.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The positivity rate increased over the period, commensurate with uptick in community prevalence identified across all national testing monitoring data streams. All positive cases were successfully followed up by the national contact tracing program. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of a COVID-19 testing survey in asymptomatic-screened patients presenting in a dental setting. The positivity rate in this patient group reflects the underlying prevalence in community at the time. These data are a salient reminder, particularly when community infection levels are rising, of the importance of appropriate ongoing Infection Prevention Control and PPE vigilance, which is relevant as healthcare team fatigue increases as the pandemic continues. Dental settings are a valuable location for public health surveillance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCorona virus disease (covid-19) is an emerging highly infectious disease caused by novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2). Several public health and social protective measures that may prevent or slow down the transmission of the COVID-19 were introduced. However, these measures are unfortunately neglected or deliberately ignored by some individuals.\n\nObjectiveTo identify the factors influencing intention to adhere to precautionary measures againstCOVID-19 in Sudan.\n\nMethods and DesignCross sectional online based survey using virtual convenience sampling technique.\n\nVariables MeasuredPerceived threat of corona virus (perceived severity and perceived susceptibility), perceived benefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy and intention to adhere to precautionary behavior towards COVID-19\n\nResultsThe significant predictors of intention to adhere to the precautionary behavior against COVID-19 were: gender ({beta} =3.34, P <0.001), self-efficacy ({beta}= 0.476, P<0.001), perceived benefits ({beta}= 0.349, P<0.001) and perceived severity ({beta}= 0.113, P=0.005). These factors explained 43% of the variance in participants intention to adhere to the protective measures. Participants who were female, confident in their ability to adhere to the protective measures when available, believing in the benefits of the protective measures against COVID-19 and perceiving that the disease could have serious consequences were more likely to be willing to adhere to the protective measures.\n\nConclusionHealth Belief model is a useful framework for addressing factors influencing intention to adhere to precautionary behavior during COVID pandemic.",

    "abstract": "The clinical outcome of COVID-19 has an extreme age, genetic and comorbidity bias that is thought to be driven by an impaired immune response to SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the disease. The unprecedented impact of COVID-19 on global health has resulted in multiple studies generating a variety of large gene expression datasets in a relatively short period of time. In order to better understand the immune dysregulation induced by SARS-CoV-2, we carried out a meta-analysis of these transcriptomics data available in the published literature. Datasets included both those available from SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines in vitro and those from patient samples. We focused our analysis on the identification of viral perturbed host functions as captured by co-expressed gene module analysis. Transcriptomics data from lung biopsies and nasopharyngeal samples, as opposed to those available from other clinical samples and infected cell lines, provided key signatures on the role of the hosts immune response on COVID-19 pathogenesis. For example, severity of infection and patients age are linked to the absence of stimulation of the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, a known critical immediate line of defense against RNA viral infections that triggers type-I interferon responses. In addition, co-expression analysis of age-stratified transcriptional data provided evidence that signatures of key immune response pathways are perturbed in older COVID-19 patients. In particular, dysregulation of antigen-presenting components, down-regulation of cell cycle mechanisms and signatures of hyper-enriched monocytes were strongly correlated with the age of older individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, our meta-analysis highlights the ability of transcriptomics and gene-module analysis of aggregated datasets to aid our improved understanding of the host-specific disease mechanisms underpinning COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reconstructing transmission chains has become a major public health focus for many governments around the world. The modest mutation rate and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 prevents the reconstruction of transmission chains from consensus genome sequences, but within-host genetic diversity could theoretically help identify close contacts. Here we describe the patterns of within-host diversity in 1,181 SARS-CoV-2 samples sequenced to high depth in duplicate. 95% of samples show within-host mutations at detectable allele frequencies. Analyses of the mutational spectra revealed strong strand asymmetries suggestive of damage or RNA editing of the plus strand, rather than replication errors, dominating the accumulation of mutations during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Within and between host diversity show strong purifying selection, particularly against nonsense mutations. Recurrent within-host mutations, many of which coincide with known phylogenetic homoplasies, display a spectrum and patterns of purifying selection more suggestive of mutational hotspots than recombination or convergent evolution. While allele frequencies suggest that most samples result from infection by a single lineage, we identify multiple putative examples of co-infection. Integrating these results into an epidemiological inference framework, we find that while sharing of within-host variants between samples could help the reconstruction of transmission chains, mutational hotspots and rare cases of superinfection can confound these analyses.",

    "abstract": "The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2-S) binds to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) representing the initial contact point for leveraging the infection cascade. We used an automated selection process and identified an aptamer that specifically interacts with CoV2-S. The aptamer does not bind to the RBD of CoV2-S and does not block the interaction of CoV2-S with ACE2. Notwithstanding, infection studies revealed potent and specific inhibition of pseudoviral infection by the aptamer. The present study opens up new vistas in developing SARS-CoV2 infection inhibitors, independent of blocking the ACE2 interaction of the virus and harnesses aptamers as potential drug candidates and tools to disentangle hitherto inaccessible infection modalities, which is of particular interest in light of the increasing number of escape mutants that are currently being reported.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019, and the subsequent COVID-19 pandemic, has led to substantial mortality, together with mass global disruption. There is an urgent need for novel antiviral drugs for therapeutic or prophylactic application. Cathepsin L is a key host cysteine protease utilized by coronaviruses for cell entry and is recognized as a promising drug target. The marine natural product, gallinamide A and several synthetic analogues, were identified as potent inhibitors of cathepsin L activity with IC50 values in the picomolar range. Lead molecules possessed selectivity over cathepsin B and other related human cathepsin proteases and did not exhibit inhibitory activity against viral proteases Mpro and PLpro. We demonstrate that gallinamide A and two lead analogues potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, with EC50 values in the nanomolar range, thus further highlighting the potential of cathepsin L as a COVID-19 antiviral drug target.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is the aetiological agent of COVID-19 disease and has been spreading worldwide since December 2019. The virus has been shown to infect different animal species under experimental conditions. Also, minks have been found to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection in fur farms in Europe and the USA. Here we investigated 91 individual minks from a farm located in Northern Poland. Using RT-PCR, antigen detection and NGS, we confirmed 15 animals positive for SARS-CoV-2. The result was verified by sequencing of full viral genomes, confirming SARS-CoV-2 infection in Polish mink. Country-scale monitoring conducted by veterinary inspection so far has not detected the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on other mink farms. Taking into consideration that Poland has a high level of positive diagnostic tests among its population, there is a high risk that more Polish mink farms become a source for SARS-CoV-2. Findings reported here and from other fur producing countries urge the assessment of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in animals bred in Polish fur farms.",

    "abstract": "With the global epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, it is important to monitor the variation, haplotype subgroup epidemic trends and key mutations of SARS-CoV-2 over time effectively, which is of great significance to the development of new vaccines, the update of therapeutic drugs, and the improvement of detection reagents. The AutoVEM tool developed in the present study could complete all mutations detections, haplotypes classification, haplotype subgroup epidemic trends and key mutations analysis for 131,576 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in 18 hours on a 1 core CPU and 2G internal storage computer. Through haplotype subgroup epidemic trends analysis of 131,576 genome sequences, the great significance of the previous 4 specific sites (C241T, C3037T, C14408T and A23403G) was further revealed, and 6 new mutation sites of highly linked (T445C, C6286T, C22227T, G25563T, C26801G and G29645T) were discovered for the first time that might be related to the infectivity, pathogenicity or host adaptability of SARS-CoV-2. In brief, we proposed an integrative method and developed an efficient automated tool to monitor haplotype subgroup epidemic trends and screen out the key mutations in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 over time for the first time, and all data could be updated quickly to track the prevalence of previous key mutations and new key mutations because of high efficiency of the tool.

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has inspired renewed interest in understanding the fundamental pathology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following infection because fatal COVID-19 cases are commonly linked to respiratory failure due to ARDS. The pathologic alteration known as diffuse alveolar damage in endothelial and epithelial cells is a critical feature of acute lung injury in ARDS. However, the pathogenesis of ARDS following SRAS-CoV-2 infection remains largely unknown.\n\nIn the present study, we examined apoptosis in post-mortem lung sections from COVID-19 patients and lung tissues from a non-human primate model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in a cell-type manner, including type 1 and 2 alveolar cells and vascular endothelial cells (ECs), macrophages, and T cells. Multiple-target immunofluorescence (IF) assays and western blotting suggest both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways are activated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 fails to induce apoptosis in human bronchial epithelial cells (i.e., BEAS2B cells) and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), which are refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, infection of co-cultured Vero cells and HUVECs or Vero cells and BEAS2B cells with SARS-CoV-2 induced apoptosis in both Vero cells and HUVECs/BEAS2B cells, but did not alter the permissiveness of HUVECs or BEAS2B cells to the virus. Post-exposure treatment of the co-culture of Vero cells and HUVECs with an EPAC1-specific activator ameliorated apoptosis in HUVECs. These findings may help to delineate a novel insight into the pathogenesis of ARDS following SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged as a new human pathogen in late 2019 and has infected an estimated 10% of the global population in less than a year. There is a clear need for effective antiviral drugs to complement current preventive measures including vaccines. In this study, we demonstrate that berberine and obatoclax, two broad-spectrum antiviral compounds, are effective against multiple isolates of SARS-CoV-2. Berberine, a plant-derived alkaloid, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations and obatoclax, originally developed as an anti-apoptotic protein antagonist, was effective at sub-micromolar concentrations. Time-of-addition studies indicated that berberine acts on the late stage of the viral life cycle. In agreement, berberine mildly affected viral RNA synthesis, but strongly reduced infectious viral titers, leading to an increase in the particle-to-pfu ratio. In contrast, obatoclax acted at the early stage of the infection, in line with its activity to neutralize the acidic environment in endosomes. We assessed infection of primary human nasal epithelial cells cultured on an air-liquid interface and found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced and repressed expression of a specific set of cytokines and chemokines. Moreover, both obatoclax and berberine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in these primary target cells. We propose berberine and obatoclax as potential antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 that could be considered for further efficacy testing.",

    "abstract": "Since the beginning of the COVID19 pandemics, an unprecedented research effort has been conducted to analyze the antibody responses in patients, and many trials based on passive immunotherapy -- notably monoclonal antibodies -- are ongoing. Twenty-one antibodies have entered clinical trials, 6 having reached phase 2/3, phase 3 or having received emergency authorization. These represent only the tip of the iceberg, since many more antibodies have been discovered and represent opportunities either for diagnosis purposes or as drug candidates. The main problem facing laboratories willing to develop such antibodies is the huge task of analyzing them and choosing the best candidate for exhaustive experimental validation. In this work we show how artificial intelligence-based methods can help in analyzing large sets of antibodies in order to determine in a few hours the best candidates in few hours. The MAbCluster method, which only requires knowledge of the amino acid sequences of the antibodies, allows to group the antibodies having the same epitope, considering only their amino acid sequences and their 3D structures (actual or predicted), and to infer some of their functional properties. We then use MAbTope to predict the epitopes for all antibodies for which they are not already known. This allows an exhaustive comparison of the available epitopes, but also gives a synthetic view of the possible combinations. Finally, we show how these results can be used to predict which antibodies might be affected by the different mutations arising in the circulating strains of the virus, such as the N501Y mutation that has started to spread in Great-Britain.",

    "abstract": "Rapid and sensitive screening tools for SARS-CoV-2 infection are essential to limit the spread of COVID-19 and to properly allocate national resources. Here, we developed a new point-of-care, non-contact thermal imaging tool to detect COVID-19, based on image-processing algorithms and machine learning analysis. We captured thermal images of the back of individuals with and without COVID-19 using a portable thermal camera that connects directly to smartphones. Our novel image processing algorithms automatically extracted multiple texture and shape features of the thermal images and achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 in detecting COVID-19 with up to 92% sensitivity. Thermal imaging scores were inversely correlated with clinical variables associated with COVID-19 disease progression. We show, for the first time, that a hand-held thermal imaging device can be used to detect COVID-19. Non-invasive thermal imaging could be used to screen for COVID-19 in out-of-hospital settings, especially in low-income regions with limited imaging resources.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundImmunochromatographic rapid antigen tests (RATs) emerged onto the COVID-19 pandemic testing landscape to aid in the rapid diagnosis of people with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. RATs are particularly useful where RT-PCR is not immediately available and symptoms suggestive of a high viral load and infectiousness are assumed. Several lateral flow immunoassays have been authorized for use under EUA and/or the CE mark, presenting varying overall clinical performance data generated by the manufacturer or by independent investigators. To compare the real-world clinical performance of commercially available rapid chromatographic immunoassays intended for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2, we performed a systematic meta-analysis of published data.\n\nMethodsWe searched the MEDLINE(R), Embase, BIOSIS and Derwent Drug File (ProQuest)for manufacturer-independent prospective clinical performance studies comparing SARS-CoV-2 RATs and RT-PCR assays. Only studies on lateral flow assays not needing a separate reader for retrieving the result were included, if data were available on viral load, patients symptom status, sample type, and PCR assay used. For better data comparability, recalculation of the studies single performance data confidence intervals using the exact Clopper-Pearson method was applied.\n\nResultsWe could include 19 studies (ten peer-reviewed) presenting detailed clinical performance data on 11,209 samples with 2449 RT-PCR-positives out of study prevalence rates between 1.9-100 % and between 50- 100% symptomatic samples. Four studies directly compared two to three different RATs and 15 studies compared one RAT to RT-PCR. Overall specificity ranged, with one test outlier, between 92.4% (87.4- 95.9) and 100% (99.7-100), and overall clinical sensitivity varied between 28.9% (16.4-44.3) and 98.3% (91.1-99.7), depending on assay, population characteristics, viral load, and symptom status. Sensitivity in high-viral-load samples (cycle threshold [&le;]25) showed a considerable heterogeneity among the assays ranging from 66.7% to 100%.\n\nConclusionOnly two RATs offered sufficient manufacturer-independent, real-world performance data supporting use for the detection of current SARS-CoV-2 infection in symptomatic or high-viral-load patient populations. Reliable positive predictive values require testing of symptomatic patients or asymptomatic individuals only in case of a high pre-test probability. If RATs are used for screening of asymptomatic cases in low-prevalence scenarios, a lower positive predictive value of the result has to be considered.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThe propagation of COVID-19 in Spain prompted the declaration of the state of alarm on March 14, 2020. On 2 December 2020, the infection had been confirmed in 1,665,775 patients and caused 45,784 deaths. This unprecedented health crisis challenged the ingenuity of all professionals involved. Decision support systems in clinical care and health services management were identified as crucial in the fight against the pandemic.\n\nMethodsThis study applies Deep Learning techniques for mortality prediction in COVID-19 patients. Two datasets with clinical information (medication, laboratory tests, vital signs etc.) of 2,307 and 3,870 COVID-19 infected patients admitted to two Spanish hospital chains were used. Firstly, we built a sequence of temporal events gathering all the clinical information for each patient. Next, we used the temporal sequences to train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model with an attention mechanism exploring interpretability. We conducted extensive experiments and trained the RNNs in different settings, performing hyperparameter search and cross-validation. We ensembled resulting RNNs to reduce variability and enhance sensitivity.\n\nResultsWe assessed the performance of our models using both global metrics, by averaging the performance across all the days in the sequences. We also measured day-by-day metrics starting from the day of hospital admission and the outcome day and evaluated the daily predictions. Regarding sensitivity, when compared to more traditional models, our best two RNN ensemble models outper-form a Support Vector Classifier in 6 and 16 percentage points, and Random Forest in 23 and 18 points. For the day-by-day predictions from the outcome date, the models also achieved better results than baselines showing systems ability towards early predictions.\n\nConclusionsWe have shown the feasibility of our approach to predict the clinical outcome (i.e. discharged alive or death) of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The result is a time series model that can support decision-making in healthcare systems and aims at interpretability. Despite the low-resource scenario, the results achieved are promising and suggests that more data will further increase the performance of the model.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionLittle is known to date about the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on self-harm incidence.\n\nMethodsThe number of hospitalizations for self-harm in France (mainland and overseas) from January to August 2020 (which includes the first confinement from March 17th to May 11th) was compared to the same period in 2019-2017. Hospital data with the ICD-10 codes X60-84 were extracted from the national administrative database (PMSI).\n\nResultsThere were 53,583 hospitalizations for self-harm in France between January and August 2020. Compared to the same period in 2019, this represents an overall 8.5% decrease. This decrease started the first week of the confinement and the number of hospitalizations remained at lower levels relative to 2019 until the end of August. The decrease was more marked in women (-9.8%) than men (-6.4%). However, an increase in hospitalizations was observed in individuals aged 75 and older (+5.3 to +11.6%). Moreover, the number of self-harm by firearm (+20.3%), jumping from height (+10.5%), and drowning (+4.7%) increased between 2019 and 2020, as well as the number of hospitalizations in intensive care (+3.5%) and deaths at discharge from hospital (+8.0%). No correlation was found between the evolution in the number of hospitalizations for self-harm and the number of severe cases of Covid-19 (hospitalization and mortality rates) across administrative departments.\n\nDiscussionDuring the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic in France - including the first confinement -, a general decrease in the number of hospitalizations for self-harm was observed. However, an increase was found among elderly, a population at higher Covid 19-related mortality risk, and in the number of more severe suicidal acts. These results, therefore, shed light on a complex relationship between the pandemic and self-harm occurrence. This situation may change with time, which requires active suicide prevention strategies.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 has widely spread across the world, and much research is being conducted on the causative virus SARS-CoV-2. To help control the infection, we developed the Coronavirus GenBrowser (CGB) to monitor the pandemic. CGB allows visualization and analysis of the latest viral genomic data. Distributed genome alignments and an evolutionary tree built on the existing subtree are implemented for easy and frequent updates. The tree-based data are compressed at a ratio of 2,760:1, enabling fast access and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants. CGB can effectively detect adaptive evolution of specific alleles, such as D614G of the spike protein, in their early stage of spreading. By lineage tracing, the most recent common ancestor, dated in early March 2020, of nine strains collected from six different regions in three continents was found to cause the outbreak in Xinfadi, Beijing, China in June 2020. CGB also revealed that the first COVID-19 outbreak in Washington State was caused by multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2. To encourage data sharing, CGB credits the person who first discovers any SARS-CoV-2 variant. As CGB is developed with eight different languages, it allows the general public in many regions of the world to easily access pre-analyzed results of more than 132,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. CGB is an efficient platform to monitor adaptive evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWhile it is well-known that older individuals with certain comorbidities are at highest risk for complications related to COVID-19 including hospitalization and death, we lack tools to identify communities at highest risk with fine-grained spatial and temporal resolution. Information collected at a county level obscures local risk and complex interactions between clinical comorbidities, the built environment, population factors, and other social determinants of health.\n\nMethodsWe develop a robust COVID-19 Community Risk Score (C-19 Risk Score) that summarizes the complex disease co-occurrences for individual census tracts with unsupervised learning, selected on their basis for association with risk for COVID complications, such as death. We mapped the C-19 Risk Score onto neighborhoods in New York City and associated the score with C-19 related death. We further predict the C-19 Risk Score using satellite imagery data to map the built environment in C-19 Risk.\n\nResultsThe C-19 Risk Score describes 85% of variation in co-occurrence of 15 diseases that are risk factors for COVID complications among 26K census tract neighborhoods (median population size of tracts: 4,091). The C-19 Risk Score is associated with a 40% greater risk for COVID-19 related death across NYC (April and September 2020) for a 1SD change in the score (Risk Ratio for 1SD change in C19 Risk Score: 1.4, p < .001). Satellite imagery coupled with social determinants of health explain nearly 90% of the variance in the C-19 Risk Score in the United States in held-out census tracts (R2 of 0.87).\n\nConclusionsThe C-19 Risk Score localizes COVID-19 risk at the census tract level and predicts COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 transmission are not well characterised in Western populations. We sought to identify potential risk factors for transmission and actionable information to prevent for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nMethodsIndividuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 at four major laboratories were invited. In addition, participants were sampled by convenience after a media campaign. Self-reported test results were compared with laboratory results, demographic data and behavioural facts were collected using a digital platform. In a cross-sectional design positive cases were compared with negative and untested control groups.\n\nFindingsApproximately 14 days after a countrywide lockdown in Norway, 116,678 participants were included. Median age was 46 years, 44% had children in preschool or in school; 18% were practicing health professionals. International flights, contact with infected, and gatherings of more than 50 people, were associated with high risk. Health professionals who used public transport were at higher risk of testing positive than those who did not. Having undergone light infections, the last six months was strongly associated with lower odds ratio of SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Contact with children, use of hand sanitiser and use of protective gloves in private were also associated with lower odds ratio of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nInterpretationFurther research is needed to explore if being a parent or looking after children is associated with lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the next phases of the pandemic. Immunological research should be done to determine the effects of prior trivial infections on SARS-CoV-2 infection. We confirm that large gatherings during the pandemic should be avoided and those who are infected, or under suspicion thereof, posed very high risks to others this population.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundReducing contacts is a cornerstone of containing SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated the effect of physical distancing measures and of school reopening on contacts and consequently on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Brussels, a hotspot during the second European wave.\n\nMethodsUsing SARS-CoV-2 case reports and contact tracing data during August-November 2020, we estimated changes in the age-specific number of reported contacts. We associated these trends with changes in the instantaneous reproduction number Rt and in age-specific transmission-events during distinct intervention periods in the Brussels region. Furthermore, we analysed trends in age-specific case numbers, pre- and post-school opening.\n\nFindingsWhen schools reopened and physical distancing measures relaxed, the weekly mean number of reported contacts surged from 2.01 (95%CI 1.73-2.29) to 3.04 (95%CI 2.93-3.15), increasing across all ages. The fraction of cases aged 10-19 years started increasing before school reopening, with no further increase following school reopening (risk ratio 1.23, 95%CI 0.79-1.94). During the subsequent month, 8.9% (67/755) of infections identified were from teenagers to other ages, while 17.0% (131/755) from other ages to teenagers. Rt peaked mid-September at 1.48 (95%CI 1.35-1.63). Reintroduction of physical distancing measures reduced reported contacts to 1.85 (95%CI 1.78-1.91), resulting in Rt dropping below 1 within 3 weeks.\n\nInterpretationThe second pandemic wave in Brussels was the result of increased contacts across all ages following school reopening. Stringent physical distancing measures, including closure of bars and limiting close contacts while schools remain open, reduced social mixing, in turn controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission.\n\nFundingEuropean Commission H2020.

    "abstract": "ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to compare the perception, confidence, hesitancy, and acceptance rate of various COVID-19 vaccine types among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Saudi Arabia, a nation with MERS-CoV experience.\n\nDesignNational cross-sectional, pilot-validated questionnaire.\n\nSettingOnline, self-administered questionnaire among HCWs.\n\nParticipantsA total of 2,007 HCWs working in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia participated; 75.3% completed the survey and were included in the analysis.\n\nInterventionData were collected through an online survey sent to HCWs during November 1-15, 2020. The main outcome measure was HCW acceptance of COVID-19 candidate vaccines. The associated factors of vaccination acceptance were identified through a logistic regression analysis and via measurement of the level of anxiety, using the generalized anxiety disorder 7 (GAD7) scale.\n\nResultsAmong the 1512 HCWs who were included, 62.4% were women, 70.3% were between 21 and 40 years of age, and the majority (62.2%) were from tertiary hospitals. In addition, 59.5% reported knowing about at least one vaccine; 24.4% of the participants were sure about their willingness to receive the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, and 20.9% were willing to receive the RNA BNT162b2 vaccine. However, 18.3% reported that they would refuse to receive the Ad5-vectored vaccine, and 17.9% would refuse the Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine. Factors that influenced the differential readiness of HCWs included their perceptions of the vaccines efficiency in preventing the infection (33%), their personal preferences (29%), and the vaccines manufacturing country (28.6%).\n\nConclusionsAwareness by HCWs of the several COVID-19 candidate vaccines could improve their perceptions and acceptance of vaccination.

    "abstract": "BackgroundTo stop pandemics, such as COVID-19, infected individuals should be detected, treated if needed, and -to prevent contacts with susceptible individuals-isolated. Because most infected individuals may be asymptomatic, when testing misses such cases, epidemics may growth exponentially, inducing a high number of deaths. In contrast, a relatively low number of COVID-19 related deaths may occur when both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases are tested.\n\nMethodsTo evaluate these hypotheses, a method composed of three elements was evaluated, which included: (i) county- and country-level geo-referenced data, (ii) cost-benefit related considerations, and (iii) temporal data on mortality or test positivity (TP). TP is the percentage of infections found among tested individuals. Temporal TP data were compared to the tests/case ratio (T/C ratio) as well as the number of tests performed/million inhabitants (tests/mi) and COVID-19 related deaths/million inhabitants (deaths/mi).\n\nFindingsTwo temporal TP profiles were distinguished, which, early, displayed low ([~] 1 %) and/or decreasing TP percentages or the opposite pattern, respectively. Countries that exhibited >10 TP % expressed at least ten times more COVID-19 related deaths/mi than low TP countries. An intermediate pattern was identified when the T/C ratio was explored. Geo-referenced, TP-based analysis discovered municipalities where selective testing would be more cost-effective than alternatives.\n\nInterpretationsWhen TP is low and/or the T/C ratio is high, testing detects asymptomatic cases and the number of COVID-19 related deaths/mi is low. Geo-referenced TP data can support cost-effective, site-specific policies. TP promotes the prompt cessation of epidemics and fosters science-based testing policies.\n\nFundingNone\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSTo map this field, bibliographic searches were conducted in the Web of Science, which included the following results: (i) COVID-19 (95,133 hits), (ii) SARS COV-2 (33,680 hits), (iii) testing policy and COVID-19 (939 hits), (iv) testing policy and SARS COV-2 (340 hits), (v) testing policy and COVID-19 and asymptomatic (80 hits), (vi) testing policy and SARS COV-2 and asymptomatic (54 hits); (vii) test positivity and COVID-19 and validation (7 hits), and (viii) test positivity and SARS CoV-2 and validation (5 hits). Therefore, before this study, testing policy in relation to asymptomatic cases as well as test positivity represented a very low proportion (between [~]1 thousandth to [~] 1 ten thousandth) of all publications. While many articles distinguished between diagnostic and screening tests, no paper was found in which testing policy is mentioned as part of a process ultimately designed to isolate all infected individuals. The few articles that mentioned test positivity only investigated symptomatic cases. These quanti/qualitative assessments led the authors to infer that neither testing policy nor test positivity had been adequately validated and/or investigated.\n\nAdded value of this studyWe provide the first validation of test positivity as an estimate of disease prevalence under rapidly changing conditions: in pandemics, disease prevalence may vary markedly within short periods of time. We also address a double limitation of control campaigns against COVID-19, namely: it is unknown who and where to test. Asymptomatic cases are not likely to seek medical assistance: while they feel well, they silently spread this pandemic. Because they represent approximately half of all infected individuals, they are a large, moving, and invisible target. Where to find them is also unknown because (i) randomized testing is likely to fail and (ii) testing is very limited. Usually, the locations where infected people reside are not randomly distributed but geographically clustered, and, up to now less than four persons per thousand inhabitants are tested on a given day. However, by combining geo-referenced test positivity data with cost-benefit considerations, we generate approaches not only likely to induce high benefits without increasing costs but also free of assumptions: we measure bio-geography as it is.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceThe fact that asymptomatic cases were not tested in many countries may explain the exponential growth and much higher number of deaths observed in those countries. Ineffective testing (and, therefore, ineffective isolation) can also result from the absence of geo-referenced data analysis. Because the geographical location where people reside, work, study, or shop is not a random event, the analysis of small greographical areas is essential. Only when actual geographical relationships are observed, optimal (cost-benefit oriented) testing policies can be devised.",

    "abstract": "Romania officially declared its first SARS-CoV-2 case on February 26, 2020. The first and largest COVID-19 outbreak in Romania was recorded in Suceava, N/E region of the country, and originated at the Suceava regional county hospital. Following sheltering-in-place measures, infection rates decreased, only to rise again after relaxation of measures. This study describes the incursion of SARS-CoV-2 in Suceava and other parts of Romania and analyzes the mutations and their association with clinical manifestation of the disease during the period of COVID-19 outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis indicated multiple sites of origin for SARS-CoV-2 strains in Suceava, specifically from Spain, Italy and Russia, but also other strains related to those from Czech Republic, Belgium and France. Most Suceava samples contained mutations common to European lineages, such as A20268G, however aproximately 10% of samples were missing such mutations, indicating a possible different origin. While overall genome regions ORF1ab, S and ORF7 were subject to most mutations, several recurring mutations such as C27707T were identified, and these were mainly present in severe forms of the disease. Non-synonymous mutations, such as C3225A (Thr987Asn in NSP3a domain), associated with changes in a protein responsible for decreasing viral tethering in human host were also present. Patients with diabetes and hypertension exhibited eight and three time,s respectively, higher odds ratios of acquiring severe forms of the disease and these were mainly related to C27707T mutation. These results will aid in tracing virus movement throughout Romania and identification of infectivity, virulence and pathogenicity.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesLimited SARS CoV 2 testing in many African countries has constrained availability of data on the impact of COVID-19 (CV19). To address this gap, we conducted a systematic post-mortem surveillance study to directly measure the fatal impact of CV19 in an urban African population.\n\nDesignWe enrolled deceased individuals at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) Morgue in Lusaka, Zambia. We obtained nasopharyngeal swabs for testing via reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) against the SARS-2 Coronavirus. We stratified deaths by CV19 status, by location, age, sex, and underlying risk factors.\n\nSettingUTH is Zambias largest tertiary care referral hospital and its morgue registers [~]80% of Lusakas deaths.\n\nParticipantsParticipants of all ages were enrolled if within 48 hours of death and if the next of kin or representative provided written informed consent.\n\nResultsWe enrolled 372 participants between June and September 2020, and had PCR results for 364 (99.5%). CV19 was detected in 70/364 (19.2%). The median age for CV19+ deaths was 48 years (IQR 36-72 years) and 70% were male. Most CV19+ deaths (51/70, 72.8%) occurred in the community; none had been tested for CV19 antemortem. Among the 19/70 facility deaths, six were tested antemortem. Among the 52/70 CV19 deaths with symptoms data, 44/52 had typical symptoms of CV19 (cough, fever, shortness of breath), of whom only five were tested antemortem. We identified CV19 among seven children; only one had been tested antemortem. The proportion of CV19+ deaths increased with age, but 75.7% of CV19+ deaths were aged <60 years. The five most common co-morbidities among CV19+ deaths were: tuberculosis (31.4%); hypertension (27.1%); HIV/AIDS (22.9%); alcohol use (17.1%); and diabetes (12.9%).\n\nConclusionsContrary to expectations, CV19+ deaths were common in Lusaka. The majority occurred in the community where testing capacity is lacking. Yet few who died at facilities were tested, despite presenting with typical symptoms of CV19. Therefore, CV19 cases were under reported because testing was rarely done, not because CV19 was rare. If our data are generalizable, the impact of CV19 in Africa has been vastly underestimated.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCOVID-19 is a new infectious disease with severe disease course and high mortality in some groups. Blood tests on admission to the hospital can be useful for stratification of patients and timely correction. Our study investigated the clinical features of COVID-19 patients in Latvia and differences in blood tests in groups with different disease severity.\n\nMethodsThe retrospective study included 100 patients hospitalized in Riga East Clinical University Hospital in Spring 2020. The severity of the disease course was classified by the presence of pneumonia and its combination with respiratory failure. We have assessed blood cells count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), troponin T, electrolytes, creatinine, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), D-dimer, prothrombin time, prothrombin index, oxygen saturation, and temperature on admission to the hospital.\n\nResultsPatients were from 18 to 99 (57{+/-}18 years, 57% males). Comorbidities were found in 74% of patients. The mild, moderate, and severe groups included 35, 44, and 16 patients, respectively. In the severe group, the mortality rate was 50%. The progression to severe COVID-19 was associated positively with temperature, ESR, CRP, creatinine, LDH, and troponin T and negatively associated with oxygen saturation, eosinophils, and GFR on admission to the hospital.\n\nConclusionsCOVID-19 severity associates with lower renal function and a higher level of inflammation and tissue damage. Eosinophils, CRP, ESR, LDH, troponin T, creatinine, and GFR are blood indicators for monitoring patients condition.",

We then placed the manikin inside the enclosure and used a laser sheet to visualize the aerosol leaking out. We show that with sufficient suction, it is possible to effectively contain aerosol from the manikin even at high flow rates (up to 60 L min-1) of oxygen, reducing aerosol exposure outside the enclosure by 99%.

    "abstract": "ObjectiveCrises such as the COVID-19 pandemic are known to exacerbate depression and anxiety, though their temporal trajectories remain unclear. The present study aims to investigate fluctuations in depression and anxiety using COVID-19 as a model crisis.\n\nMethods1,512 adults living in the U.S. enrolled in this online study on April 2nd, 2020 and were assessed weekly for 10 weeks (until June 4th, 2020; final n=537). Depression and anxiety were measured using the Zung Self-Rating Depression scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (state subscale), respectively, along with demographic and COVID-related questions. Mixed-effects linear regression models were used to examine factors contributing to longitudinal changes in depression and anxiety.\n\nResultsDepression and anxiety levels were high in early April, but declined over time (F(9,4824)=17.53, p<.001 and F(9,4824)=23.35, p<.001, respectively). In addition to demographic factors such as sex, age, income, and psychiatric diagnoses, we identified some overlapping and some distinct dynamic factors contributing to changes in depression and anxiety: worsening of weekly individual economic impact of COVID-19 increased both depression and anxiety, while increased seven-day change in COVID-19 cases, social media use, and projected pandemic duration were positively associated with anxiety, but not depression.\n\nConclusionsAlongside evidence for overall emotional adaptation, these findings highlight overlapping (economic), yet distinct (change in COVID-19 cases, social media use, and projected COVID-19 duration) factors contributing to fluctuations in depression and anxiety throughout the first wave of COVID-19. These results provide insight into socioeconomic policies and behavioral changes that can increase emotional adaptation in times of crisis.",

    "abstract": "The cellular entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronaviruses types 1 and 2 (SARS-CoV-1 and -2) requires sequential protease processing of the viral spike glycoprotein (S). The presence of a polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 S at the S1/S2 boundary has been suggested to be a factor in the increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV-1 by facilitating maturation of the S precursor by furin-like proteases in the producer cells rather than endosomal cathepsins in the target. We investigate the relevance of the polybasic cleavage site in the route of entry of SARS-CoV-2 and the consequences this has for sensitivity to interferons, and more specifically, the IFN-induced transmembrane (IFITM) protein family that inhibit entry of diverse enveloped viruses. We found that SARS-CoV-2 is restricted predominantly by IFITM2 and the degree of this restriction is governed by route of viral entry. Removal of the cleavage site in the spike protein renders SARS-CoV-2 entry highly pH- and cathepsin-dependent in late endosomes where, like SARS-CoV-1 S, it is more sensitive to IFITM2 restriction. Furthermore, we find that potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication by type I but not type II IFNs is alleviated by targeted depletion of IFITM2 expression. We propose that the polybasic cleavage site allows SARS-CoV-2 to mediate viral entry in a pH-independent manner, in part to mitigate against IFITM-mediated restriction and promote replication and transmission. This suggests therapeutic strategies that target furin-mediated cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 S may reduce viral replication through the activity of type I IFNs.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe furin cleavage site in the S protein is a distinguishing feature of SARS-CoV-2 and has been proposed to be a determinant for the higher transmissibility between individuals compared to SARS-CoV-1. One explanation for this is that it permits more efficient activation of fusion at or near the cell surface rather than requiring processing in the endosome of the target cell. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 is inhibited by antiviral membrane protein IFITM2, and that the sensitivity is exacerbated by deletion of the furin cleavage site which restricts viral entry to low pH compartments. Furthermore, we find that IFITM2 is a significant effector of the antiviral activity of type I interferons against SARS-CoV-2 replication. We suggest one role of the furin cleavage site is to reduce SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity to innate immune restriction, and thus may represent a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 treatment development.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEngland exited a four-week second national lockdown on 2nd December 2020 initiated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior results showed that prevalence dropped during the first half of lockdown, with greater reductions in higher-prevalence northern regions.\n\nMethodsREACT-1 is a series of community surveys of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR swab-positivity in England, designed to monitor the spread of the epidemic and thus increase situational awareness. Round 7 of REACT-1 commenced swab-collection on 13th November 2020. A prior interim report included data from 13th to 24th November 2020 for 105,122 participants. Here, we report data for the entire round with swab results obtained up to 3rd December 2020.\n\nResultsBetween 13th November and 3rd December (round 7) there were 1,299 positive swabs out of 168,181 giving a weighted prevalence of 0.94% (95% CI 0.87%, 1.01%) or 94 per 10,000 people infected in the community in England. This compares with a prevalence of 1.30% (1.21%, 1.39%) from 16th October to 2nd November 2020 (round 6), a decline of 28%. Prevalence during the latter half of round 7 was 0.91% (95% CI, 0.81%, 1.03%) compared with 0.96% (0.87%, 1.05%) in the first half. The national R number in round 7 was estimated at 0.96 (0.88, 1.03) with a decline in prevalence observed during the first half of this period no longer apparent during the second half at the end of lockdown. During round 7 there was a marked fall in prevalence in West Midlands, a levelling off in some regions and a rise in London. R numbers at regional level ranged from 0.60 (0.41, 0.80) in West Midlands up to 1.27 (1.04, 1.54) in London, where prevalence was highest in the east and south-east of the city. Nationally, between 13th November and 3rd December, the highest prevalence was in school-aged children especially at ages 13-17 years at 2.04% (1.69%, 2.46%), or approximately 1 in 50.\n\nConclusionBetween the previous round and round 7 (during lockdown), there was a fall in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 swab-positivity nationally, but it did not fall uniformly over time or by geography. Continued vigilance is required to reduce rates of infection until effective immunity at the population level can be achieved through the vaccination programme.",

    "abstract": "Since mid-March 2020 the Federal and state governments in Germany agreed on comprehensive public health measures to contain the spread of Covid-19. We study the effects of the policy actions on the progression of the pandemic in the first containment period in spring 2020 before easing of measures have started to work by the end of April. To exploit both the time and spatial dimension in the dissemination of the virus, we conduct a spatial data panel analysis for German NUTS-3 regions. Specifically, we employ a spatial difference-in-differences approach to identify the effects of individual public health measures. We find that contact restrictions and closure of schools substantially contributed to flattening the infection curve. Additionally, a strong treatment effect of wearing face masks is established in the few treated regions during the containment phase. No incremental effect is evidenced for closure of establishments and shutdown of shopping malls and other stores. These findings prove to be highly robust to changes in model specification. By contrast, the dampening effect of restaurant closure is sensitive to model variation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAfter eight months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Latin American countries have some of the highest rates in COVID-19 mortality. Despite being one of the most unequal regions of the world, there is a scarce report of the effect of socioeconomic conditions on COVID-19 mortality in their countries. We aimed to identify the effect of some socioeconomic inequality-related factors on COVID-19 mortality in Colombia.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a survival analysis in a nation-wide retrospective cohort study of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Colombia from March 2nd to October 26th, 2020. We calculated the time to death or recovery for each confirmed case in the cohort. We used an extended multivariable time-dependent Cox regression model to estimate the hazard risk ratio (HR) by age groups, sex, ethnicity, type of health insurance, area of residence, and socioeconomic strata.\n\nResultsThere were 1 033 218 confirmed cases and 30 565 deaths for COVID-19 in Colombia between March 2nd and October 26th. The risk of dying for COVID-19 among confirmed cases was higher in males (HR=1.68 95% CI: 1.64-1.72), in people older than 60 years (HR=296.58 95% CI: 199.22-441.51), in indigenous people (HR=1.20 95% CI: 1.08-1.33), in people with subsidized health insurance regime (HR=1.89 95% CI: 1.83-1.96), and in people living in the very low socioeconomic strata (HR=1.44 95% CI: 1.24-1.68).\n\nConclusionOur study provides evidence of socioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality in terms of age groups, sex, ethnicity, type of health insurance regime, and socioeconomic status.",

    "abstract": "The lockdown and social distancing policy imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on both mental health service delivery, and the ways in which people are accessing these services. Previous reports from the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for around 1.2m residents in South London) have highlighted increased use of virtual contacts by mental health teams, with dropping numbers of face-to-face contacts over the first wave of the pandemic. There has been concern that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic would lead to higher mental health emergencies, particularly instances of self-harm. However, with people advised to stay at home during the  first wave lockdown, it is as yet unclear whether this impacted mental health service presentations. Taking advantage of SLaMs Clinical Records Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource with daily updates of information from its electronic mental health records, this paper describes overall presentations to Emergency Department (ED) mental health liaison teams, and those with self-harm. The paper focussed on three periods: i) a pre-lockdown period 1st February to 15th March, ii) a lockdown period 16th March to 10th May and iii) a post-lockdown period 11th May to 28th June. In summary, all attendances to EDs for mental health support decreased during the lockdown period, including those with self-harm. All types of self-harm decreased during lockdown, with self-poisoning remaining the most common. Attendances to EDs for mental health support increased post-lockdown, although were only just approaching pre-lockdown levels by the end of June 2020.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCohort studies of people with a history of COVID-19 infection and controls will be essential to understand the epidemiology of long-term effects. However, clinical diagnosis requires resources that are frequently restricted to the severely ill. Cohort studies may have to rely on surrogate indicators of COVID-19 illness. We describe the prevalence and overlap of five potential indicators: self-reported suspicion, self-reported core symptoms, symptom algorithm, self-reported routine test results, and home antibody testing.\n\nMethodsAn occupational cohort of staff and postgraduate students at a large London university who participated in surveys and antibody testing. Self-report items cover March to June 2020 and antibody test results from  lateral flow IgG/IgM antibody test cassettes sent to participants in June 2020.\n\nResultsValid antibody test results were returned for 1882 participants. Of the COVID-19 indicators, the highest prevalence was core symptoms (770 participants positive, 41%), followed by participant suspicion of infection (n=509, 27%), a symptom algorithm (n=297, 16%), study antibody positive test (n=124, 6.6%) and self-report of a positive external test (n=39, 2.1%). Study antibody positive result was rare in people who had no suspicion they had experienced COVID-19 (n=4, 0.7%) or did not experience core symptoms (n=10, 1.6%). When study antibody test results were compared with earlier external antibody results in those who had reported them, the study antibody results agreed in 88% cases (kappa= 0.636), with a lower proportion testing positive on this occasion (proportion with antibodies detected 15% in study test vs 24% in external testing).\n\nDiscussionOur results demonstrate that there is some agreement between different COVID indicators, but that they a more complete story when used together. Antibody testing may provide greater certainty and be one of the only ways to detect asymptomatic cases, but is likely to under-ascertain due to weak antibody responses to mild infection, which wane over time. Cohort studies will need to review how they deal with different and sometimes conflicting indicators of COVID-19 illness in order to study the long-term outcomes of COVID-19 infection and related impacts.\n\nWhat is already known on this subject?Research into the effects of COVID-19 in the community is needed to respond to the pandemic. Objective testing has not been widely available and accuracy may not be high when carried out in retrospect. Many cohort studies are considering how best to measure COVID-19 infection status.\n\nWhat this study adds?Antibody testing is feasible, but it is possible that sensitivity may be poor. Each indicator included added different aspects to the ascertainment of COVID-19 exposure. Using combinations of self-reported and objectively measured variables, it may be possible to tailor COVID-19 indicators to the situation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEarly in the COVID-19 pandemic the NHS recommended that appropriate patients anticoagulated with warfarin should be switched to direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), requiring less frequent blood testing. Subsequently, a national safety alert was issued regarding patients being inappropriately co-prescribed two anticoagulants following a medication change, and associated monitoring.\n\nObjectiveTo describe which people were switched from warfarin to DOACs; identify potentially unsafe co-prescribing of anticoagulants; and assess whether abnormal clotting results have become more frequent during the pandemic.\n\nMethodsWorking on behalf of NHS England we conducted a population cohort based study using routine clinical data from >17 million adults in England.\n\nResults20,000 of 164,000 warfarin patients (12.2%) switched to DOACs between March and May 2020, most commonly to edoxaban and apixaban. Factors associated with switching included: older age, recent renal function test, higher number of recent INR tests recorded, atrial fibrillation diagnosis and care home residency. There was a sharp rise in co-prescribing of warfarin and DOACs from typically 50-100 per month to 246 in April 2020, 0.06% of all people receiving a DOAC or warfarin. INR testing fell by 14% to 506.8 patients tested per 1000 warfarin patients each month. We observed a very small increase in elevated INRs (n=470) during April compared with January (n=420).\n\nConclusionsIncreased switching of anticoagulants from warfarin to DOACs was observed at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic in England following national guidance. There was a small but substantial number of people co-prescribed warfarin and DOACs during this period. Despite a national safety alert on the issue, a widespread rise in elevated INR test results was not found. Primary care has responded rapidly to changes in patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the aetiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) pandemic. ICEP4 purified compound (ICEP4) is a recently discovered furocoumarin-related purified compound derived from the roots and seeds of Angelica archangelica (herbal drug). ICEP4-related herbal preparations have been extensively used as active herbal ingredients in traditional medicine treatments in several European countries. Extraction method of patent pending ICEP4 (patent application no. GB2017123.7) has previously shown strong manufacturing robustness, long-lasting stability, and repeated chemical consistency. Here we show that ICEP4 presents a significant in vitro cytoprotective effect in highly virulent-SARS-CoV-2 challenged Vero E6 cellular cultures, using doses of 34.5 and 69 M. No dose-related ICEP4 toxicity was observed in Vero E6 cells, M0 macrophages, B, CD4+ T and CD8+ T lymphocytes, Natural Killer (NK) or Natural Killer T (NKT) cells. No dose-related ICEP4 inflammatory response was observed in M0 macrophages quantified by IL6 and TNF release in cell supernatant. No decrease in survival rate was observed after either 24 hr acute or 21-day chronic exposure in in vivo toxicity studies performed in C. elegans. Therefore, ICEP4 toxicological profile has demonstrated marked differences compared to others vegetal furocoumarins. Successful ICEP4 doses against SARS-CoV-2-challenged cells are within the maximum threshold of toxicity concern (TTC) of furocoumarins as herbal preparation, stated by European Medicines Agency (EMA). The characteristic chemical compounding of ICEP4, along with its safe TTC, allow us to assume that the first-observation of a natural antiviral compound has occurred. The potential druggability of a new synthetic ICEP4-related compound remains to be elucidated. However, well-established historical use of ICEP4-related compounds as herbal preparations may point towards an already-safe, widely extended remedy, which may be ready-to-go for large-scale clinical trials under the EMA emergency regulatory pathway. To the best of the authors knowledge, ICEP4-related herbal drug can be postulated as a promising therapeutic treatment for COVID19.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe SARS-Cov-2 pandemic and the lockdown response have increased mental health problems in general populations compared to pre-pandemic times. The course of mental health problems during and after the first lockdown phase has not yet been reviewed.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a rapid review of multi-wave studies in general populations with time points during and after the first lockdown phase. Repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were included. The main outcome assessed was whether indicators of mental health problems have changed during and after the first lockdown phase. The study was registered with PROSPERO No. CRD42020218640\n\nFindings23 studies with 56 indicators were included in the qualitative review. Studies that reported data from pre-pandemic assessments through lockdown indicated an increase in mental health problems. During lockdown no uniform trend could be identified. After lockdown mental health problems decreased slightly.\n\nInterpretationAs mental health care utilization indicators and data on suicides do not suggest an increase in demand during the first lockdown phase, we regard the increase in mental health problems as general distress that is to be expected during a global health crisis. Several methodological, pandemic-related, response-related and health policy-related factors need to be considered when trying to gain a broader perspective on the impact of the first wave of the pandemic and the first phase of lockdown on general populations mental health.",

    "abstract": "The pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19, represents a significant and ongoing international health crisis. A key symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the onset of fever, with a hyperthermic temperature range of 38 to 41{degrees}C. Fever is an evolutionarily conserved host response to microbial infection and inflammation that can influence the outcome of viral pathogenicity and regulation of host innate and adaptive immune responses. However, it remains to be determined what effect elevated temperature has on SARS-CoV-2 tropism and replication. Utilizing a 3D air-liquid interface (ALI) model that closely mimics the natural tissue physiology and cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory airway, we identify tissue temperature to play an important role in the regulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We show that temperature elevation induces wide-spread transcriptome changes that impact upon the regulation of multiple pathways, including epigenetic regulation and lncRNA expression, without disruption of general cellular transcription or the induction of interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral immune defences. Respiratory tissue incubated at temperatures >37{degrees}C remained permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection but severely restricted the initiation of viral transcription, leading to significantly reduced levels of intraepithelial viral RNA accumulation and apical shedding of infectious virus. To our knowledge, we present the first evidence that febrile temperatures associated with COVID-19 inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Our data identify an important role for temperature elevation in the epithelial restriction of SARS-CoV-2 that occurs independently of the induction of canonical IFN-mediated antiviral immune defences and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesCharacterize the quality of life and depressive symptoms of university students in Peru during the COVID-19 pandemic and to determine the associated factors.\n\nMethodsMulti-centre study in 1634 university students recruited by convenience sampling. Quality of life (QoL) was assessed with the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions at three levels (EQ-5D-3L) and depressive symptoms with the Patient Health Questionarie-9 (PHQ-9). To evaluate factors associated with QoL and depressive symptoms, linear and adjusted regressions were used, with robust variance reporting coefficients ({beta}).\n\nResultsThe percentage of participants most affected by QoL dimension was: anxiety/depression (47.2%) and pain/discomfort (35.6%). Regarding the Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS) of QoL, the score was 76.0 + 25.6. Those who had family economic decline during quarantine ({beta}=-3.4, IC95%=-6.5 to -0.3) or family with chronic diseases ({beta}=-3.7, IC95%=-6.1 to -1.4) presented significantly lower scores in their QoL. Regarding depressive symptomatology, the university students reported a moderate to severe level (28.9%). A higher risk of depressive symptoms was found in residents of Ayacucho ({beta}=0.8, IC95%=0.1 to 1.5), those who were released from quarantine ({beta}=0.7, IC95%=0.2 to 1.2) and those who had a family member with chronic disease ({beta}=1.5, IC95%=1.0 to 2.1).\n\nConclusionsAlmost half and one third of participants reported anxiety/depression, and pain/discomfort in their QoL respectively. Nearly a third presented moderate and severe depressive symptoms. The deterioration of QoL was worse in those who had a decrease in income and a family member with chronic illness. The presence of depressive symptoms was found in students in Ayacucho, those who left home during quarantine and those who had a family member with chronic diseases.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionReliable rapid testing on COVID-19 is needed in care homes to reduce the risk of outbreaks and enable timely care. Point-of-care testing (POCT) in care homes could provide rapid actionable results. This study aimed to examine the usability and test performance of point of care polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for COVID-19 in care homes.\n\nMethodsPoint-of-care PCR for detection of SARS-COV2 was evaluated in a purposeful sample of four UK care homes. Test agreement with laboratory real-time PCR and usability and use errors were assessed.\n\nResultsPoint of care and laboratory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests were performed on 278 participants. The point of care and laboratory tests returned uncertain results or errors for 17 and 5 specimens respectively. Agreement analysis was conducted on 256 specimens. 175 were from staff: 162 asymptomatic; 13 symptomatic. 69 were from residents: 59 asymptomatic; 10 symptomatic. Asymptomatic specimens showed 83.3% (95% CI: 35.9%-99.6%) positive agreement and 98.7% negative agreement (95% CI: 96.2%-99.7%), with overall prevalence and bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) of 0.965 (95% CI: 0.932 - 0.999). Symptomatic specimens showed 100% (95% CI: 2.5%-100%) positive agreement and 100% negative agreement (95% CI: 85.8%-100%), with overall PABAK of 1. No usability-related hazards emerged from this exploratory study.\n\nConclusionApplications of point-of-care PCR testing in care homes can be considered with appropriate preparatory steps and safeguards. Agreement between POCT and laboratory PCR was good. Further diagnostic accuracy evaluations and in-service evaluation studies should be conducted, if the test is to be implemented more widely, to build greater certainty on this initial exploratory analysis.\n\nKey pointsO_LIPoint of care tests (POCT) in care homes are feasible and could increase testing capacity for the control of COVID-19 infection.\nC_LIO_LIThe test of agreement between POCT and laboratory PCR for care home residents and the staff was good.\nC_LIO_LIAdoption of POCT in care homes can be considered with appropriate preparatory steps and safeguards in place.\nC_LIO_LIRepetitive errors and test malfunctioning can be mitigated with bespoke training for care home staff.\nC_LIO_LIIntegrated care pathways should be investigated to test the high variability of the context of use.\nC_LI",

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic provides impetus to determine that benefit given increased risk of secondary infection and nosocomial transmission by multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens linked with expansion of critical care capacity.\n\nMethodsProspective evaluation of CMg using nanopore sequencing was performed on 43 respiratory samples over 14 weeks from a cohort of 274 intubated patients across seven COVID-19 intensive care units.\n\nResultsBacteria or fungi were cultured from 200 (73%) patients, with a predominance of Klebsiella spp. (31%) and C. striatum (7%) amongst other common respiratory pathogens. An 8 hour CMg workflow was 93% sensitive and 81% specific for bacterial identification compared to culture, and reported presence or absence of {beta}-lactam resistance genes carried by Enterobacterales that would modify initial guideline-recommended antibiotics in every case. CMg was also 100% concordant with quantitative PCR for detecting Aspergillus fumigatus (4 positive and 39 negative samples). Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-typing using 24 hour sequence data identified an MDR-K. pneumoniae ST307 outbreak involving 4 patients and an MDR-C. striatum outbreak potentially involving 14 patients across three ICUs.\n\nConclusionCMg testing for ICU patients provides same-day pathogen detection and antibiotic resistance prediction that significantly improves initial treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and rapidly detects unsuspected outbreaks of MDR-pathogens.",

However, the underlying risk factors for the development of cardiovascular related manifestations are unclear.\n\nMethodsUsing a register-based multi-center cross-sectional design, we analyzed 80 patients with myocardial injury and 401 controls, as well as 71 patients with arrhythmia and 409 controls, all admitted with COVID-19. Putative risk factors for myocardial injury and arrhythmia were evaluated with logistic regression with adjustment for potential confounders.\n\nResultsCOVID-19 patients with myocardial injury had fatigue (66.2%) and dyspnea (63.7%), while those with arrhythmia had dyspnea (71.8%). Patients with myocardial injury and arrhythmia had a significant mortality of 92.5% and 94.4%, respectively. A history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or heart diseases was associated with an increased risk of myocardial injury (odds ratio [OR] = 1.94, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-3.71; OR = 7.43, 95% CI: 3.99-13.83) and arrhythmia (OR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.00-3.75; OR = 13.16, 95% CI: 6.75-25.68).

    "abstract": "Data collected from 38 states from August 3 - November 15, 2020 showed more than 250,000 confirmed student and staff cases of SARS-CoV-2 in K-12 schools1. Yet, analysis of COVID-19 case data in USA schools has been extremely limited2,3. To date, no large-scale or state-wide analyses by school level and grade has been published, opening a wide gap in understanding COVID-19 in American schools. A large-scale assessment of available data and trends could provide a baseline for understanding the virus in the K-12 learning environment and dispel misconceptions about the prevalence of COVID-19 in schools.\n\nTable of Contents SummaryUsing the most comprehensive database of K-12 COVID-19 case data in the country, Florida provides clues for understanding student and staff cases in schools.\n\nWhats known on this subjectFlorida schools began reopening to in-person instruction in August have reported more than 18,000 student and staff cases of COVID-19 as of November 14, 2020. Incidence of COVID-19 cases in K-12 students and staff is of urgent public health concern.\n\nWhat this study addsCOVID-19 cases reported in Florida schools were most influenced by community case rates, district mask policies, and percent of students attending face-to-face. Student case rates were highest in high schools (12.5 per 1,000).",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEthnic minorities have experienced disproportionate COVID-19 mortality rates. We estimated associations between household composition and COVID-19 mortality in older adults ([&ge;] 65 years) using a newly linked census-based dataset, and investigated whether living in a multi-generational household explained some of the elevated COVID-19 mortality amongst ethnic minority groups.\n\nMethodsUsing retrospective data from the 2011 Census linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (2017-2019) and death registration data (up to 27th July 2020), we followed adults aged 65 years or over living in private households in England from 2 March 2020 until 27 July 2020 (n=10,078,568). We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for COVID-19 death for people living in a multi-generational household compared with people living with another older adult, adjusting for geographical factors, socio-economic characteristics and pre-pandemic health. We conducted a causal mediation analysis to estimate the proportion of ethnic inequalities explained by living in a multi-generational household.\n\nResultsLiving in a multi-generational household was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death. After adjusting for confounding factors, the HRs for living in a multi-generational household with dependent children were 1.13 [95% confidence interval 1.01-1.27] and 1.17 [1.01-1.35] for older males and females. The HRs for living in a multi-generational household without dependent children were 1.03 [0.97 - 1.09] for older males and 1.22 [1.12 - 1.32] for older females. Living in a multi-generational household explained between 10% and 15% of the elevated risk of COVID-19 death among older females from South Asian background, but very little for South Asian males or people in other ethnic minority groups.\n\nConclusionOlder adults living with younger people are at increased risk of COVID-19 mortality, and this is a notable contributing factor to the excess risk experienced by older South Asian females compared to White females. Relevant public health interventions should be directed at communities where such multi-generational households are highly prevalent.\n\nFundingThis research was funded by the Office for National Statistics.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic mandates the use of N-95/FFP-2 masks for healthcare workers, especially in operation room (OR) for surgical or aerosol producing procedures. During pandemic, surgical interventions such as limb trauma, limb amputations, and limb malignancies continued to flow into the hospitals and are normally performed under local, regional or spinal anaesthesia. N-95/FFP-2 masks normally do not prevent escape of exhaled air to surrounding and to avoid the escape of exhaled unfiltered air, sealing masks by taping its edges to face possibly serves the purpose, but causes significant discomfort to patients. HEPA filters, high vacuum suction apparatus, and negative pressure operating-room may protect partially against the-risk of infection if patients exhaled air is infected. In order to reduce risk of transmission from patients exhaled air to the healthcare workers, a technique has been designed to divert the patients exhaled air to outside the-OR using a suction machine. This technique is easy, simple and cost-effective and trial has been performed with four-volunteers to see feasibility to breathe through N-95 mask sealed by sticking its edges to face using tape. The trial reflected reduction in SpO2, causing increased respiratory-rate, tachycardia and hypertension, in-addition an un-acclimatized volunteers had difficulty in breathing through sealed N-95 masks, which was relieved by supplying oxygen to them. Attaching suction system to remove the-exhaled air aids to comfort levels. Treating exhaled-air with sodium-hypochlorite and diverting it externally to an open-space outside the-OR added to safety for the patients, surgical team and the hospital surroundings.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDiagnostic work-up of participants following any COVID-19 associated symptom for example, in vaccine efficacy trials will lead to extensive testing, potentially overwhelming laboratory capacity whilst primarily yielding negative results. We aimed to identify an efficient symptom combination to capture most cases using the lowest possible number of tests.\n\nMethodsUK and US users of the COVID-19 Symptom Study app who reported new-onset symptoms between March-September 2020 and an RT-PCR test within seven days of symptom onset were included. Sensitivity, specificity, and number of RT-PCR tests needed to identify one RT-PCR positive case were calculated for individual symptoms and symptom combinations. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm was applied to generate symptom combinations with good trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity.\n\nFindingsThe UK cohort included 122,305 individuals (1,202 RT-PCR positive). Findings were replicated in the US cohort which included 3,162 individuals (79 RT-PCR positive). Within three days of symptom onset, the COVID-19 specific symptom combination (cough, dyspnoea, fever, anosmia/ageusia) identified 69% of cases requiring 47 RT-PCR tests per case (TPC). The symptom combination with highest sensitivity at three days was fatigue, anosmia, cough, diarrhoea, headache, sore throat, identifying 96% of cases and requiring 96 TPC.\n\nInterpretationWe confirm the significance of COVID-19 specific symptoms widely recommended for triggering RT-PCR. By using the data-driven optimization technique we identified additional symptoms (fatigue, sore throat, headache, diarrhoea) that enabled many more positive cases to be captured efficiently. By providing a set of solutions with optimal trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, we produced a selection of symptom combinations that maximise the capture of cases given different laboratory capacities. This may be of use for COVID-19 vaccine developers across a range of resource settings and have more far-reaching public health implications for detection of symptomatic SARS CoV2 infection.\n\nFundingZoe Global Limited, Department of Health, Wellcome Trust, Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Medical Research Council (MRC), Alzheimers Society, Massachusetts Consortium for Pathogen Readiness (MassCPR), Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed up to November 16, 2020, with the terms \"COVID-19\" OR \"SARS-CoV-2\" AND \"symptom\" AND \"community-based\", with no date or language restrictions, to find information about symptoms associated with COVID-19 from the community setting. The search retrieved 68 articles; however, most were not relevant as related to specific subgroups (e.g. pregnant women, cancer patients) or aspects (e.g. mental health, diagnostic testing). Fever, cough, dyspnoea, tachypnoea, anosmia, and ageusia are the symptoms most commonly identified in COVID-19 patients and typically included in guidelines from the WHO and similar bodies. These data however come primarily from hospital-based studies. An assessment of the value of symptom combinations for predicting COVID-19 in the community is lacking.\n\nAdded value of this studyWe present data from the largest, prospective community-based cohort study to date and quantify the contribution of COVID-19 symptoms and symptom combinations to COVID-19 case-finding. Our study is unique in that it simulates PCR testing in a clinical trial. Using RT-PCR as the gold standard for detecting COVID-19, we assessed the sensitivity and specificity of symptoms occurring within three days of symptom onset. An analysis of symptoms occurring within seven days of symptom onset aimed to capture delayed symptom triggers. We confirm the significance of fever, cough, and anosmia/ageusia, widely used to trigger RT-PCR testing and identified fatigue, headache, sore throat, and diarrhoea as additional symptoms for efficient COVID-19 case finding.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceThe applied methodology enables the selection of symptom combinations to maximise the capture of cases while taking account of specific laboratory capacity. Our findings not only have important implications for COVID-19 vaccine developers to optimise the choice of triggering symptoms for diagnostic work-up COVID-19 vaccine efficacy trials, but also have wider public health implications for early detection of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo review evidence of the effectiveness of travel measures implemented during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to recommend change on how evidence is incorporated in the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR).\n\nDesignWe used an abbreviated preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis protocol (PRISMA-P) and a search strategy aimed to identify studies that investigated the effectiveness of travel-related measures (advice, entry and exit screening, medical examination or vaccination requirements, isolation or quarantine, the refusal of entry, and entry restrictions), pre-printed or published by June 1, 2020.\n\nResultsWe identified 29 studies, of which 26 were modelled (vs. observational). Thirteen studies investigated international measures while 17 investigated domestic measures (one investigated both), including suspended transportation (24 studies), border restrictions (21), and screening (5). There was a high level of agreement that the adoption of travel measures led to important changes in the dynamics of the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most of the identified studies investigated the initial export of cases out of Wuhan, which was found to be highly effective, but few studies investigated the effectiveness of measures implemented in other contexts. Early implementation was identified as a determinant of effectiveness. Most studies of international travel measures failed to account for domestic travel measures, and thus likely led to biased estimates. Poor data and other factors contributed to the low quality of the studies identified.\n\nConclusionTravel measures, especially those implemented in Wuhan, played a key role in shaping the early transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the effectiveness of these measures was short-lived. There is an urgent need to address important evidence gaps, but also a need to review the way in which evidence is incorporated in the IHR in the early phases of a novel infectious disease outbreak.\n\nWhat is already known on this subject?O_LIPrevious reviews of the evidence from outbreaks of influenza and other infectious disease have generally found that there is limited evidence that travel-measures are effective at containing outbreaks.\nC_LIO_LIHowever, it is unclear if the lessons from other infectious disease outbreaks would be relevant in the context of COVID-19.\nC_LIO_LIBased on evidence at the time, WHO did not recommend any travel restrictions when it declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.\nC_LI\n\nWhat does this study add?O_LIThis study rapidly reviews the evidence on the effectiveness of travel measures implemented in the early phase of the pandemic on epidemiological countries.\nC_LIO_LIThe study investigated both international and domestic travel measures and a wide range of travel measures.\nC_LIO_LIThe study finds that the domestic travel measures implemented in Wuhan were effective at reducing the importation of cases internationally and within China. The study also finds that travel measures are more effective when implemented earlier in the outbreak.\nC_LIO_LIThe findings generate recommendations on how to incorporate evidence into the International Health Regulations and highlights important research gaps that remain.\nC_LI\n\nHow might this affect future outbreaks?O_LIThe findings of this study suggest the need to decouple recommendations of travel measures from the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern.\nC_LIO_LIHighlights the need to evaluate the potential effectiveness of travel measures for each outbreak, and not just assume effectiveness based on past outbreak scnearios.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesAntigen tests have recently emerged as an interesting alternative to SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic PCR, thought to be valuable especially for the screening of bigger communities. To check appropriateness of the antigen based testing, we determined sensitivity of two point-of-care antigen tests when applied to a cohort of COVID-19 symptomatic, COVID-19 asymptomatic and healthy persons.\n\nMethodsWe examined nasopharyngeal swabs with antigen test 1 (Panbio Covid-19 Ag Rapid Test, Abbott) and antigen test 2 (Standard F Covid-19 Ag FIA, SD Biosensor). An additional nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab of the same individual was checked with PCR (Allplex SARS-nCoV-2, Seegene). Within a 4-day period in October 2020, we collected specimens from 591 subjects. Of them, 290 had COVID-19 associated symptoms.\n\nResultsWhile PCR positivity was detected in 223 cases, antigen test 1 and antigen test 2 were found positive in 148 (sensitivity 0.664, 95% CI 0.599 - 0.722) and 141 (sensitivity 0.623, 95% CI 0.558 - 0.684) patients, respectively. When only symptomatic patients were analysed, sensitivity increased to 0.738 (95% CI 0.667 - 0.799) for the antigen test 1 and to 0.685 (95% CI 0.611 - 0.750) for the antigen test 2. The substantial drop in sensitivity to 12.9% (95% CI 0.067 - 0.234) was observed for samples with the PCR threshold cycle above > 30.\n\nConclusionsLow sensitivity of antigen tests leads to the considerable risk of false negativity. It is advisable to implement repeated testing with high enough frequency if the antigen test is used as a frontline screening tool.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCOVID-19 spread may have a dramatic impact in countries with vulnerable economies and limited availability of, and access to, healthcare resources and infrastructures. However, in sub-Saharan Africa a low prevalence and mortality have been observed so far.\n\nMethodsWe collected data on individuals social contacts in Ethiopia across geographical contexts characterized by heterogeneous population density, work and travel opportunities, and access to primary care. We assessed how socio-demographic factors and observed mixing patterns can influence the COVID-19 disease burden, by simulating SARS-CoV-2 transmission in remote settlements, rural villages, and urban neighborhoods, under the current school closure mandate.\n\nResultsFrom national surveillance data, we estimated a net reproduction number of 1.62 (95%CI 1.55-1.70). We found that, at the end of an epidemic mitigated by school closure alone, 10-15% of the overall population would have been symptomatic and 0.3-0.4% of the population would require mechanical ventilation and/or possibly result in a fatal outcome. Higher infection attack rates are expected in more urbanized areas, but the highest incidence of critical disease is expected in remote subsistence farming settlements.\n\nConclusionsThe relatively low burden of COVID-19 in Ethiopia can be explained by the estimated mixing patterns, underlying demography and the enacted school closures. Socio-demographic factors can also determine marked heterogeneities across different geographical contexts within the same country. Our findings can contribute to understand why sub-Saharan Africa is experiencing a relatively lower attack rate of severe cases compared to high income countries.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 genome accumulates point mutations in a constant manner. Whether the accumulation of point mutations is correlated with milder manifestations of COVID-19 remains unknown.\n\nMethodsWe performed SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing in 90 patients with COVID-19 infection treated at a tertiary medical center in Tokyo between March and August 2020. The possible association between disease severity and viral haplotype was then assessed by counting the number of mutations in addition to performing phylogenic tree analysis, comparative amino acid sequence analysis among {beta}-coronaviruses, and mathematical prediction of the functional relevance of amino acid substitutions.\n\nResultsThe number of non-synonymous mutations was inversely correlated with COVID-19 severity, as defined by requiring oxygen supplementation. Phylogenic tree analysis identified two predominant groups which were separated by a set of 6 single nucleotide substitutions, including four leading to non-synonymous amino acid substitutions. Among those four, Pro108Ser in 3 chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) and Pro151Leu in nucleocapsid protein occurred at conserved locations and were predicted to be deleterious. Patients with Pro108Ser in 3CLpro and Pro151Leu in nucleocapsid protein had a lower odds ratio for developing hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen (odds ratio of 0.24 [95% confidence interval of 0.07-0.88, P-value = 0.032]) after adjustments for age and sex, compared with patients lacking this haplotype in Clade 20B.\n\nConclusionViral genome sequencing in 90 patients treated in the Tokyo Metropolitan area showed that the accumulation of point mutations, including Pro108Ser in 3CLpro and Pro151Leu in nucleocapsid protein, was inversely correlated with COVID-19 severity. Further in vitro research is awaited.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNasopharyngeal antigen Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) and saliva RT-PCR have shown variable performance to detect SARS-CoV-2.\n\nMethodsIn October 2020, we conducted a prospective trial involving patients presenting at testing centers with symptoms of COVID-19. We compared detection rates and performance of RDT, saliva PCR and nasopharyngeal (NP) PCR.\n\nResultsOut of 949 patients enrolled, 928 patients had all three tests. Detection rates were 35.2% (95%CI 32.2-38.4%) by RDT, 39.8% (36.6-43.0%) by saliva PCR, 40.1% (36.9-43.3%) by NP PCR, and 41.5% (38.3-44.7%) by any test. For those with viral loads (VL) [&ge;]106 copies/ml, detection rates were 30.3% (27.3-33.3), 31.4% (28.4-34.5), 31.5% (28.5-34.6), and 31.6% (28.6-34.7%) respectively.\n\nSensitivity of RDT compared to NP PCR was 87.4% (83.6-90.6%) for all positive patients and 96.5% (93.6-98.3%) for those with VL[&ge;]106. Sensitivity of STANDARD-Q(R), Panbio and COVID-VIRO(R) Ag tests were 92.9% (86.4-96.9%), 86.1% (78.6-91.7%) and 84.1% (76.9-89.7%), respectively. For those with VL[&ge;]106, sensitivities were 96.6% (90.5-99.3%), 97.8% (92.1-99.7%) and 95.3% (89.4-98.5%) respectively. Specificity of RDT was 100% (99.3-100%) compared to any PCR. RDT sensitivity was similar <4 days (87.8%) and [&ge;]4 days (85.7%) after symptoms onset (p=0.6). Sensitivities of saliva and NP PCR were 95.7% (93.1-97.5%) and 96.5% (94.1-98.1%), respectively, compared to the other PCR.\n\nConclusionsThe high performance of RDTs allows rapid identification of COVID cases with immediate isolation of the vast majority of contagious individuals. RDT could be a game changer in primary care practices, and even more so in resource-constrained settings. PCR on saliva can replace NP PCR.\n\nClinicalTrial.gov Identifier: NCT04613310",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe limitations of widespread current COVID-19 diagnostic testing lie at both pre-analytical and analytical stages. Collection of nasopharyngeal swabs is invasive and is associated with exposure risk, high cost, and supply-chain constraints. Additionally, the RNA extraction in the analytical stage is the most significant rate-limiting step in the entire testing process. To alleviate these limitations, we developed a universal saliva processing protocol (SalivaSTAT) that would enable an extraction free RT-PCR test using any of the commercially available RT-PCR kits.\n\nMethodsWe optimized saliva collection devices, heat-shock treatment and homogenization. The effect of homogenization on saliva samples for extraction-free RT-PCR assay was determined by evaluating samples with and without homogenization and preforming viscosity measurements. Saliva samples (872) previously tested using the FDA-EUA method were reevaluated with the optimized SalivaSTAT protocol using two widely available commercial RT-PCR kits. Further, a five-sample pooling strategy was evaluated as per FDA guidelines using the SalivaSTAT protocol.\n\nResultsThe saliva collection (done without any media) performed comparable to the FDA-EUA method. The SalivaSTAT protocol was optimized by incubating saliva samples at 95{degrees}C for 30-minutes and homogenization, followed by RT-PCR assay. The clinical sample evaluation of 630 saliva samples using the SalivaSTAT protocol with PerkinElmer (600-samples) and CDC (30-samples) RT-PCR assay achieved positive (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) of 95.8% and 100%, respectively. The LoD was established as [~]20-60 copies/ml by absolute quantification. Further, a five-sample pooling evaluation using 250 saliva samples achieved a PPA and NPA of 92% and 100%, respectively.\n\nConclusionWe have optimized an extraction-free direct RT-PCR assay for saliva samples that demonstrated comparable performance to FDA-EUA assay (Extraction and RT-PCR). The SalivaSTAT protocol is a rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective method that can be adopted globally, and has the potential to meet testing needs and may play a significant role in management of the current pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Inferring the transmission potential of an infectious disease during the low-incidence period following an epidemic wave is crucial for preparedness. In this period, necessarily scarce data hamper existing inference methods, blurring early-warning signals essential for discriminating between the likelihoods of resurgence versus elimination. Advanced insight into whether a region of interest will face elevating caseloads (requiring swift community-wide interventions) or achieve local elimination (allowing interventions to be relaxed or refocussed on controlling the importation of infections), can be the difference between decisive and ineffective policy. We propose a novel early-warning framework that formally maximises information extracted from low-incidence data to robustly infer the chances of sustained local transmission or elimination in real time, at any desired scale of investigation. Applying this framework, we decipher previously hidden disease-transmission signals from the prolonged low-incidence COVID-19 data of New Zealand, Hong Kong and Victoria state, Australia. We uncover how timely interventions averted dangerous, resurgent waves of COVID-19 and support official declarations of elimination. Across these locations, we obtain strong evidence for the effectiveness of rapid and adaptive COVID-19 responses.",

    "abstract": "Structured AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSSARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a severe respiratory virus that can be transmitted through aerosol particles produced by coughing, talking, and breathing. Medical procedures used to treat severe cases such as tracheal intubation, extubation, and tracheal suctioning produce infectious aerosol particles. This presents significant risk for viral exposure of nearby healthcare workers during and following tracheal operations. This study looks at an enclosure to limit medical personnels exposure to these particles.\n\nMethodsA low-cost plastic enclosure was designed to reduce aerosol spread and viral transmission during intubation and extubation procedures. The enclosure consists of clear polycarbonate for maximum visibility. Large side cutouts provide health care providers with ease of access to the patient. Aerosol particle instruments measured the aerosol containment efficacy after applying various types of plastic coverings to seal the side openings. The use of negative pressure was also tested.\n\nResultsThe enclosure with 2 layers of plastic coverings sealing the side openings reduced total escaped particle number concentrations (diameter > 0.01 m) by over 93% at 3 inches away from all openings. Concentration decay experiments indicated that the enclosure without active suction should be left on the patient for 15-20 minutes following a tracheal manipulation to allow sufficient time for >90% of aerosol particles to settle upon interior surfaces. This decreases to 5 minutes when 30 LPM suction is applied.\n\nConclusionsThis enclosure is an inexpensive, easily implemented additional layer of protection that can be used to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol transmission between patients and healthcare workers.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWhile pathogens often evolve towards reduced virulence, many counterexamples are evident. When faced with a new pathogen, such as SARS-CoV-2, it is highly desirable to be able to forecast the case fatality rate (CFR) into the future. Considerable effort has been invested towards the development of a mathematical framework for predicting virulence evolution. Although these approaches accurately recapitulate some complex outcomes, most rely on an assumed trade-off between mortality and infectivity. It is often impractical to empirically validate this constraint for human pathogens.\n\nResultsUsing a compartment model with parameters tuning the degree to which symptomatic individuals are isolated and the duration of immunity, we reveal kinetic constraints where the variation of multiple parameters in concert leads to decreased virulence and increased pathogen fitness, whereas independent variation of the parameters decreases pathogen fitness. Smallpox, SARS-CoV-2, and Influenza are analyzed as diverse representatives of human respiratory viruses. We show that highly virulent viruses, such as Smallpox, are likely often constrained by host behavior, whereas moderately virulent viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, appear to be typically constrained by the relationship between the duration of immunity and CFR.\n\nConclusionsThe evolution of human respiratory epidemics appears to be often kinetically constrained and a reduction in virulence should not be assumed. Our findings imply that, without continued public health intervention, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to continue presenting a substantial disease burden. The existence of a parameter regime admitting endemic equilibrium suggests that herd immunity is unachievable. However, we demonstrate that even partial isolation of symptomatic individuals can have a major effect not only by reducing the number of fatalities in the short term but also by potentially changing the evolutionary trajectory of the virus towards reduced virulence.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAngiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as the host receptor for SARS-CoV-2, with a critical role in viral infection. We aim to understand population level variation of nasopharyngeal ACE2 expression in people tested for COVID-19 and the relationship between ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load, while adjusting for expression of the complementary protease, Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), soluble ACE2, age, and biological sex.\n\nMethodsA cross-sectional study of n=424 participants aged 1-104 years referred for COVID-19 testing was performed in British Columbia, Canada. Participants who tested negative or positive for COVID-19 were matched by age and biological sex. Viral and host gene expression was measured by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Bivariate analysis and multiple linear regression were performed to understand the role of nasopharyngeal ACE2 expression in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ACE2 gene was targeted to measure expression of transmembrane and soluble transcripts.\n\nFindingsAnalysis shows no association between age and nasopharyngeal ACE2 expression in those who tested negative for COVID-19 (P=0{middle dot}092). Mean expression of transmembrane (P=1{middle dot}2e-4), soluble ACE2 (P<0{middle dot}0001) and TMPRSS2 (P<0{middle dot}0001) differed between COVID-19-negative and -positive groups. In bivariate analysis of COVID-19-positive participants, expression of transmembrane ACE2 positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral load (P<0{middle dot}0001), expression of soluble ACE2 negatively correlated (P<0{middle dot}0001), and no correlation was found with TMPRSS2 (P=0{middle dot}694). Multivariable analysis showed that the greatest viral RNA loads were observed in participants with high transmembrane ACE2 expression (B=0{middle dot}886, 95%CI:[0{middle dot}596 to 1{middle dot}18]), while expression of soluble ACE2 may protect against high viral RNA load in the upper respiratory tract (B= -0{middle dot}0990, 95%CI:[-0{middle dot}176 to -0{middle dot}0224]).\n\nInterpretationNasopharyngeal ACE2 expression plays a dual, contrasting role in SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper respiratory tract. Transmembrane ACE2 positively correlates, while soluble ACE2 negatively correlates with viral RNA load after adjusting for age, biological sex and expression of TMPRSS2.\n\nFundingThis project (COV-55) was funded by Genome British Columbia as part of their COVID-19 rapid response initiative.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThis aggregated population study of 219 regions in 11 European countries investigated the effect of the seemingly quasi-randomly assigned school winter holiday week on excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic during spring 2020. A secondary aim was to evaluate the impact of stringency and timing of the government responses to the early inflow of infected cases.\n\nMethodsRegional data on mortality week 14-23 in 2020 compared with the same period 2015-2019 were retrieved from Eurostat and national statistical agencies. Data on initial government responses were obtained from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. Variance-weighted least square regression was used with further adjustment for population density and age distribution.\n\nResultsBeing a region with winter holiday exclusively in week 9 was in the adjusted analysis associated with 16 weekly excess deaths (95% confidence interval 13 to 20) per million inhabitants, which corresponds to 38% of the excess mortality during the study period in these regions. A more stringent response implemented in week 11, corresponding to 10 additional units on the 0-100 ordinal scale, was associated with 20 fewer weekly deaths (95% confidence interval 18 to 22) per million inhabitants.\n\nConclusionsTravelling during winter holiday in week 9 was an amplifying event that contributed importantly to the excess mortality observed in the study area during the spring 2020. Timely government responses to the resulting early inflow of cases was associated with lower excess mortality.",

We aimed to observe the extent of resemblance within the clinical features between the different coronavirus disease groups and to identify unique factors by disease severity that may influence the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Here, we utilize the common data model (CDM), which is the database that houses EMR records transformed into the common format to be used by multiple institutions. For the comparative analyses between the different disease groups as well as the mild and non-mild COVID-19 patients, we used independent t-test, Scheffe post-hoc test, and Games-howell post-hoc test for continuous variables, and chi-square test and Fishers exact test for categorical variables. From the analyses, we selected variables that showed p-values less than 0.05 to predict COVID-19 severity by a nominal logistic regression with adjustments to age and gender. The results showed diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, cancer, pulmonary disease, gastrointestinal disease, and renal disease in all patient groups. The proportions of cancer patients were the highest compared to other comorbidities in every comparative analysis, with no statistical significance. Additionally, we observed high degree of clinical similarity between COVID-19 and SARS patients within more than 50% of the selected clinical variables in the analyses, with no statistical significance between the two groups. Our research effectively utilized the integrated CDM to reflect real-world health challenges in the context of coronavirus. We expect the results from our study to provide clinical insights that can serve as predictor of risk factors for the future coronavirus-derived outbreak as well as the prospective guidelines for the clinical treatments.",

    "abstract": "Drug repurposing provides a rapid approach to meet the urgent need for therapeutics to address COVID-19. To identify therapeutic targets relevant to COVID-19, we conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses, deriving genetic instruments based on transcriptomic and proteomic data for 1,263 actionable proteins that are targeted by approved drugs or in clinical phase of drug development. Using summary statistics from the Host Genetics Initiative and the Million Veteran Program, we studied 7,554 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and >1 million controls. We found significant Mendelian randomization results for three proteins (ACE2: P=1.6x10-6, IFNAR2: P=9.8x10-11, and IL-10RB: P=1.9x10-14) using cis-eQTL genetic instruments that also had strong evidence for colocalization with COVID-19 hospitalization. To disentangle the shared eQTL signal for IL10RB and IFNAR2, we conducted phenome-wide association scans and pathway enrichment analysis, which suggested that IFNAR2 is more likely to play a role in COVID-19 hospitalization. Our findings prioritize trials of drugs targeting IFNAR2 and ACE2 for early management of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe challenges with modeling the spread of Covid-19 are its power-type growth during the middle stages with the exponents depending on time, and the saturation (currently) due to the protective measures. The two-phase solution we propose for the total number of detected cases of Covid-19 describes the actual curves in many countries almost with the accuracy of physics laws. Bessel functions play the key role in our approach. The differential equations we obtain are of universal type; they can describe general momentum and transient responses in behavioral psychology, invasion ecology, etc. Due to a very small number of parameters, namely, the initial transmission rate and the intensity of the hard and soft measures, we obtain a convincing explanation of the surprising uniformity of the curves of the spread in many different areas. This theory can serve as a tool for forecasting the epidemic spread and evaluating the efficiency of the protective measures, which is very much needed for epidemics. As its practical application, the computer programs aimed at providing projections for late stages of Covid-19 proved to be remarkably stable in many countries, including Western Europe, the USA and some in Asia. We provide a projection for the saturation of the 3rd wave in the USA: the corresponding number of total, detected or not, cases can presumably reach then the herd immunity levels (G-strains). This can be used to analyze the efficiency of the vaccinations.",

    "abstract": "Understanding changes in infectiousness during COVID-19 infections is critical to assess the effectiveness of public health measures such as contact tracing. Data from known source-recipient pairs can be used to estimate the average infectiousness profile of infected individuals, and to evaluate the proportion of presymptomatic transmissions. Here, we infer the infectiousness profile of COVID-19 infections using a mechanistic approach, and show that this method provides an improved fit to data from source-recipient pairs compared to previous studies. Our results indicate a higher proportion of presymptomatic transmissions than previously thought, with many transmissions occurring shortly before symptom onset. High infectiousness immediately prior to symptom onset highlights the importance of contact tracing, even if contacts from a short time window before symptom onset alone are traced.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOutbreaks of infectious diseases generate outbreaks of scientific evidence. In 2016 epidemics of Zika virus emerged, largely in Latin America and the Caribbean. In 2020, a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We compared patterns of scientific publications for the two infections over time.\n\nMethodsWe used living systematic review methods to search for and annotate publications according to study design. For Zika virus, a review team performed the tasks for publications in 2016. For SARS-CoV-2, a crowd of 25 volunteer scientists performed the tasks for publications up to May 24, 2020. We used descriptive statistics to categorise and compare study designs over time.\n\nFindingsWe found 2,286 publications about Zika virus in 2016 and 21,990 about SARS-CoV-2 up to 24 May 2020, of which we analysed a random sample of 5294. For both infections, there were more epidemiological than laboratory science studies. Amongst epidemiological studies for both infections, case reports, case series and cross-sectional studies emerged first, cohort and case-control studies were published later. Trials were the last to emerge. Mathematical modelling studies were more common in SARS-CoV-2 research. The number of preprints was much higher for SARS-CoV-2 than for Zika virus.\n\nInterpretationSimilarities in the overall pattern of publications might be generalizable, whereas differences are compatible with differences in the characteristics of a disease. Understanding how evidence accumulates during disease outbreaks helps us understand which types of public health questions we can answer and when.\n\nFundingMJC and HI are funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF grant number 176233).

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe recent outbreak of COVID-19 impacts the mental health of people worldwide. The mental conditions and the associated predictors of adults in Pakistan, the fifth most populous country in the world, during the COVID-19 remains understudied. We aim to investigate distress, anxiety and overall mental health and their associated predictors among Pakistani adults in this pandemic. We specifically examine the mental health issues based on the distance to the epicenter, a predictor that has revealed opposing evidence in other countries based on the theories of typhoon eye effect and ripple effect. The samples consist of 601 adults who were surveyed online about 2.5 months into the outbreak across Pakistan with varying distance to the epicenter of COVID-19 of Karachi in Pakistan.\n\nResultsThe results showed that 9.2% and 19.0% of the participants surpassed the cut-off of distress and anxiety disorders, respectively. Overall, the distance to the epicenter positively predicted the mental health of adults in Pakistan, and family size negatively moderated this effect. The distance to the epicenter negatively predicted distress and anxiety disorders for adults in large families, which are quite common in Pakistan.\n\nConclusionThe evidence of the study interestingly finds the prediction of the mental health of people by their distance to the epicenter depends on the family. The evidence of this study can help to provide the initial indicator for mental health care providers to screen vulnerable groups in Pakistan, a populous country that continues to struggle to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Risk factors for increased risk of death from Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) have been identified1,2 but less is known on characteristics that make communities resilient or vulnerable to the mortality impacts of the pandemic. We applied a two-stage Bayesian spatial model to quantify inequalities in excess mortality at the community level during the first wave of the pandemic in England. We used geocoded data on all deaths in people aged 40 years and older during March-May 2020 compared with 2015-2019 in 6,791 local communities. Here we show that communities with an increased risk of excess mortality had a high density of care homes, and/or high proportion of residents on income support, living in overcrowded homes and/or high percent of people with a non-White ethnicity (including Black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups). Conversely, after accounting for other community characteristics, we found no association between population density or air pollution and excess mortality. Overall, the social and environmental variables accounted for around 15% of the variation in mortality at community level. Effective and timely public health and healthcare measures that target the communities at greatest risk are urgently needed if England and other industrialised countries are to avoid further widening of inequalities in mortality patterns during the second wave.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTo assess the level of knowledge and trust in the policy decisions taken regarding the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic among Epirus Health Study (EHS) participants.\n\nMethodsThe EHS is an ongoing and deeply-phenotyped prospective cohort study that has recruited 667 participants in northwest Greece until August 31st, 2020. Level of knowledge on coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) transmission and COVID-19 severity was labeled as poor, moderate or good. Variables assessing knowledge and beliefs towards the pandemic were summarized overall and by gender, age group (25-39, 40-49, 50-59, [&ge;]60 years) and period of report (before the lifting of lockdown measures in Greece: March 30th to May 3rd, and two post-lockdown time periods: May 4th to June 31st, July 1st to August 31st). An exposure-wide association analysis was conducted to evaluate the associations between 153 explanatory variables and participants knowledge. Correction for multiple comparisons was applied using a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 5%.\n\nResultsA total of 563 participants (49 years mean age; 60% women) had available information on the standard EHS questionnaire, the clinical and biochemical measurements, and the COVID-19-related questionnaire. Percentages of poor, moderate and good knowledge status regarding COVID-19 were 4.5%, 10.0% and 85.6%, respectively. The majority of participants showed absolute or moderate trust in the Greek health authorities for the management of the epidemic (90.1%), as well as in the Greek Government (84.7%) and the official national sources of information (87.4%). Trust in the authorities was weaker in younger participants and those who joined the study after the lifting of lockdown measures (p-value[&le;]0.001). None of the factors examined was associated with participants level of knowledge after correction for multiple testing.\n\nConclusionsHigh level of knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic and trust in the Greek authorities was observed, possibly due to the plethora of good quality publicly available information and the timely management of the pandemic at its early stages in Greece. Information campaigns for the COVID-19 pandemic should be encouraged even after the lifting of lockdown measures to increase public awareness.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChildren are an important population to test for COVID-19 infection, particularly because they may shed the virus without displaying symptoms. Testing children for COVID-19 via sensitive molecular methods is important, although collecting nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens can be challenging. A less invasive mode of specimen collection that yields test results comparable to those from NP specimens would be beneficial to simplify sample collection.\n\nMethodsTo demonstrate that saliva is a suitable specimen for collection from children, the clinical usability/acceptability and the analytic performance of saliva were compared to NP specimens suspended in viral transport medium. Four different FDA EUA-approved real-time RT-PCR assays and one EUA approved saliva collection device were investigated.\n\nResultsThe study population included 526 patients between the ages of 3 and 61 years, 461 (88%) were <18 years, 425 were asymptomatic (81.1%), 92 were symptomatic (17.6%). Saliva mixed with saliva stabilizing buffer was found to yield comparable sensitivity to NP specimens when tested on the AllPlex SARS-CoV-2 molecular test (Seegene Inc). The analytic sensitivity of the AllPlex assay during testing of spiked saliva mixed with SpectrumDNA saliva stabilizer was found to be 250 genomic copies/mL.\n\nConclusionsOf the four FDA EUA-approved SARS-CoV-2 PCR assays studied, we found the AllPlex assay to be best suited for testing saliva specimens collected from children 5 years of age or older. The sensitivity of viral detection was equivalent to NP specimens when saliva specimens were mixed with the saliva stabilizer.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDuring infectious disease epidemics, a key question is whether cases travelling to new locations will trigger local outbreaks. The risk of this occurring depends on a range of factors, such as the transmissibility of the pathogen, the susceptibility of the host population and, crucially, the effectiveness of local surveillance in detecting cases and preventing onward spread. For many pathogens, presymptomatic and/or asymptomatic (together referred to here as nonsymptomatic) transmission can occur, making effective surveillance challenging. In this study, using COVID-19 as a case-study, we show how the risk of local outbreaks can be assessed when nonsymptomatic transmission can occur.\n\nMethodsWe construct a branching process model that includes nonsymptomatic transmission, and explore the effects of interventions targeting nonsymptomatic or symptomatic hosts when surveillance resources are limited. Specifically, we consider whether the greatest reductions in local outbreak risks are achieved by increasing surveillance and control targeting nonsymptomatic or symptomatic cases, or a combination of both.\n\nFindingsSeeking to increase surveillance of symptomatic hosts alone is typically not the optimal strategy for reducing outbreak risks. Adopting a strategy that combines an enhancement of surveillance of symptomatic cases with efforts to find and isolate nonsymptomatic hosts leads to the largest reduction in the probability that imported cases will initiate a local outbreak.\n\nInterpretationDuring epidemics of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, effective surveillance for nonsymptomatic hosts can be crucial to prevent local outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow at an unprecedented rate. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection than the general population but risk factors for HCW infection are not well described.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a prospective sero-epidemiological study of HCWs at a UK teaching hospital using a SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay. Risk factors for seropositivity were analysed using multivariate logistic regression.\n\nFindings410/5,698 (7{middle dot}2%) staff tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Seroprevalence was higher in those working in designated COVID-19 areas compared with other areas (9{middle dot}47% versus 6{middle dot}16%) Healthcare assistants (aOR 2{middle dot}06 [95%CI 1{middle dot}14-3{middle dot}71]; p=0{middle dot}016) and domestic and portering staff (aOR 3{middle dot}45 [95% CI 1{middle dot}07-11{middle dot}42]; p=0{middle dot}039) had significantly higher seroprevalence than other staff groups after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity and COVID-19 working location. Staff working in acute medicine and medical sub-specialities were also at higher risk (aOR 2{middle dot}07 [95% CI 1{middle dot}31-3{middle dot}25]; p<0{middle dot}002). Staff from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds had an aOR of 1{middle dot}65 (95% CI 1{middle dot}32 - 2{middle dot}07; p<0{middle dot}001) compared to white staff; this increased risk was independent of COVID-19 area working. The only symptoms significantly associated with seropositivity in a multivariable model were loss of sense of taste or smell, fever and myalgia; 31% of staff testing positive reported no prior symptoms.\n\nInterpretationRisk of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst HCWs is heterogeneous and influenced by COVID-19 working location, role, age and ethnicity. Increased risk amongst BAME staff cannot be accounted for solely by occupational factors.\n\nFundingWellcome Trust, Addenbrookes Charitable Trust, National Institute for Health Research, Academy of Medical Sciences, the Health Foundation and the NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.\n\nResearch in context\n\nEvidence before this studySpecific risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) are not well defined. Additionally, it is not clear how population level risk factors influence occupational risk in defined demographic groups. Only by identifying these factors can we mitigate and reduce the risk of occupational SARS-CoV-2 infection. We performed a review of the evidence for HCW-specific risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We searched PubMed with the terms \"SARS-CoV-2\" OR \"COVID-19\" AND \"Healthcare worker\" OR \"Healthcare Personnel\" AND \"Risk factor\" to identify any studies published in any language between December 2019 and September 2020. The search identified 266 studies and included a meta-analysis and two observational studies assessing HCW cohort seroprevalence data. Seroprevalence and risk factors for HCW infections varied between studies, with contradictory findings. In the two serological studies, one identified a significant increased risk of seroprevalence in those working with COVID-19 patients (Eyre et al 2020), as well as associations with job role and department. The other study (Dimcheff et al 2020) found no significant association between seropositivity and any identified demographic or occupational factor. A meta-analysis of HCW (Gomez-Ochoa et al 2020) assessed >230,000 participants as a pooled analysis, including diagnoses by both RT-PCR and seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and found great heterogeneity in study design and reported contradictory findings. Of note, they report a seropositivity rate of 7% across all studies reporting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCWs. Nurses were the most frequently affected healthcare personnel and staff working in non-emergency inpatient settings were the most frequently affected group. Our search found no prospective studies systematically evaluating HCW specific risk factors based entirely on seroprevalence data.\n\nAdded value of this studyOur prospective cohort study of almost 6,000 HCWs at a large UK teaching hospital strengthens previous findings from UK-based cohorts in identifying an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure amongst HCWs. Specifically, factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 exposure include caring for confirmed COVID-19 cases and identifying as being within specific ethnic groups (BAME staff). We further delineated the risk amongst BAME staff and demonstrate that occupational factors alone do not account for all of the increased risk amongst this group. We demonstrate for the first time that healthcare assistants represent a key at-risk occupational group, and challenge previous findings of significantly higher risk amongst nursing staff. Seroprevalence in staff not working in areas with confirmed COVID-19 patients was only marginally higher than that of the general population within the same geographical region. This observation could suggest the increased risk amongst HCWs arises through occupational exposure to confirmed cases and could account for the overall higher seroprevalence in HCWs, rather than purely the presence of staff in healthcare facilities. Over 30% of seropositive staff had not reported symptoms consistent with COVID-19, and in those who did report symptoms, differentiating COVID-19 from other causes based on symptom data alone was unreliable.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceInternational efforts to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst HCWs need to be prioritised. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst HCWs is heterogenous but also follows demonstrable patterns. Potential mechanisms to reduce the risk for staff working in areas with confirmed COVID-19 patients include improved training in hand hygiene and personal protective equipment (PPE), better access to high quality PPE, and frequent asymptomatic testing. Wider asymptomatic testing in healthcare facilities has the potential to reduce spread of SARS-CoV-2 within hospitals, thereby reducing patient and staff risk and limiting spread between hospitals and into the wider community. The increased risk of COVID-19 amongst BAME staff cannot be explained by purely occupational factors; however, the increased risk amongst minority ethnic groups identified here was stark and necessitates further evaluation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe current increase in the spread of (SARS-CoV-2) critically needs a multitarget diagnostic assays to promote analytical sensitivity to facilitate the public health actions.\n\nObjectiveThe aim of this study was to develop a new primer-probe set targeting N gene of SARS-CoV-2 to improve the sensitivity for detection of COVID-19(Corona Virus Disease 2019)in multiplex rRT-PCR (Reversetranscript Realtime PCR) and ddPCR (Droplet Digital PCR).\n\nResultsWe designed primers/probes set N(LZU3) targeting the N gene of 2019-nCov and proved its sensitivity in both rRT-PCR and ddPCR. When the quantity of template was 105 copies/reaction, the mean Ct value of N(LZU3) was 32.563, the detection rate was 91.7%. If the quantity of template was 52.5 copies/reaction, the mean Ct value of N(LZU3) was 33.835, and the detection rate was 83.3%, which were similar with that of N(CDC) and N(USA). The calculated lower limit of detection (LOD) of the new primer-probe set N(LZU3) used in rRT-PCR was 118 copies/reaction. We also did one-step ddPCR for detection the same serial dilution of RNA template. It shows good linearity for primer/probe sets N(LZU3). The calculated lower limit of detection (LOD) of N(LZU3) was 22.4 copies/reaction, which was 1.12 copies/ul.\n\nConclusionThe novel primer-probe set(LZU3) targeting N gene of SARS-CoV-2 could be both used in rRT-PCR and ddPCR with better sensitivity, furthermore, ddPCR method had higer sensitivity than rRT-PCR, hence it could significantly improve SARS-CoV-2 detection efficiency in low virus load and asymptomatic infection.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe genome of SARS-CoV-2 is susceptible to mutations during viral replication due to the errors generated by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. These mutations enable the SARS-CoV-2 to evolve into new strains. Viral quasispecies emerge from de novo mutations that occur in individual patients. In combination, these sets of viral mutations provide distinct genetic fingerprints that reveal the patterns of transmission and have utility in contract tracing.\n\nMethodsLeveraging thousands of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we performed a viral pangenome analysis to identify conserved genomic sequences. We used a rapid and highly efficient computational approach that relies on k-mers, short tracts of sequence, instead of conventional sequence alignment. Using this method, we annotated viral mutation signatures that were associated with specific strains. Based on these highly conserved viral sequences, we developed a rapid and highly scalable targeted sequencing assay to identify mutations, detect quasispecies and identify mutation signatures from patients. These results were compared to the pangenome genetic fingerprints.\n\nResultsWe built a k-mer index for thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and identified conserved genomics regions and landscape of mutations across thousands of virus genomes. We delineated mutation profiles spanning common genetic fingerprints (the combination of mutations in a viral assembly) and rare ones that occur in only small fraction of patients. We developed a targeted sequencing assay by selecting primers from the conserved viral genome regions to flank frequent mutations. Using a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples, we identified genetic fingerprints consisting of strain-specific mutations seen across populations and de novo quasispecies mutations localized to individual infections. We compared the mutation profiles of viral samples undergoing analysis with the features of the pangenome.\n\nConclusionsWe conducted an analysis for viral mutation profiles that provide the basis of genetic fingerprints. Our study linked pangenome analysis with targeted deep sequenced SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples. We identified quasispecies mutations occurring within individual patients, mutations demarcating dominant species and the prevalence of mutation signatures, of which a significant number were relatively unique. Analysis of these genetic fingerprints may provide a way of conducting molecular contact tracing.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody measurements can be used to estimate the proportion of a population exposed or infected and may be informative about the risk of future infection. Previous estimates of the duration of antibody responses vary.\n\nMethodsWe present 6 months of data from a longitudinal seroprevalence study of 3217 UK healthcare workers (HCWs). Serial measurements of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid were obtained. Bayesian mixed linear models were used to investigate antibody waning and associations with age, gender, ethnicity, previous symptoms and PCR results.\n\nResultsIn this cohort of working age HCWs, antibody levels rose to a peak at 24 (95% credibility interval, CrI 19-31) days post-first positive PCR test, before beginning to fall. Considering 452 IgG seropositive HCWs over a median of 121 days (maximum 171 days) from their maximum positive IgG titre, the mean estimated antibody half-life was 85 (95%CrI, 81-90) days. The estimated mean time to loss of a positive antibody result was 137 (95%CrI 127-148) days. We observed variation between individuals; higher maximum observed IgG titres were associated with longer estimated antibody half-lives. Increasing age, Asian ethnicity and prior self-reported symptoms were independently associated with higher maximum antibody levels, and increasing age and a positive PCR test undertaken for symptoms with longer antibody half-lives.\n\nConclusionIgG antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid wane within months, and faster in younger adults and those without symptoms. Ongoing longitudinal studies are required to track the long-term duration of antibody levels and their association with immunity to SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.\n\nSummarySerially measured SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid IgG titres from 452 seropositive healthcare workers demonstrate levels fall by half in 85 days. From a peak result, detectable antibodies last a mean 137 days. Levels fall faster in younger adults and following asymptomatic infection.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 pandemics sets the healthcare system to a shortage of ventilators. We aimed at assessing tidal volume (VT) delivery and air recirculation during expiration when one ventilator is divided into 2 patients. The study was performed in a research laboratory in a medical ICU of a University hospital. An ICU-dedicated (V500) and a lower-level ventilator (Elisee 350) were attached to two test-lungs (QuickLung) through a dedicated flow-splitter. A 50 mL/cmH2O Compliance (C) and 5 cmH2O/L/s Resistance (R) were set in both A and B lungs (step1), C50R20 in A / C20R20 in B (step 2), C20R20 in A / C10R20 in B (step 3), and C50R20 in A / C20R5 in B (step 4). Each ventilator was set in volume and pressure control mode to deliver 0.8L VT. We assessed VT from a pneumotachograph placed immediately before each lung, rebreathed volume, and expiratory resistance (circuit and valve). Values are median (1st-3rd quartiles) and compared between ventilators by non-parametric tests. Between Elisee 350 and V500 in volume control VT in A/B patients were 0.381/0.387 vs. 0.412/0.433L in step 1, 0.501/0.270 vs. 0.492/0.370L in step 2, 0.509/0.237 vs. 0.496/0.332L in step 3, and 0.496/0.281 vs. 0.480/0.329L in step 4. In pressure control the corresponding values were 0.373/0.336 vs. 0.430/0.414L, 0.416/0.185/0.322/0.234L, 0.193/0.108 vs. 0.176/0.092L and 0.422/0.201 vs. 0.481/0.329L, respectively (P<0.001 between ventilators at each step for each volume). Rebreathed air volume ranged between 0.7 to 37.8 ml and negatively correlated with expiratory resistance in steps 2 and 3. The lower-level ventilator performed closely to the ICU-dedicated ventilator. Due to dependence of VT to C pressure control should be used to maintain adequate VT at least in one patient when C and/or R changes abruptly and monitoring of VT should be done carefully. Increasing expiratory resistance should reduce rebreathed volume.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVascular thrombosis is common in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Etiologies underlying this complication are unclear.\n\nPurposeTo determine the prevalence of antiphospholipid (aPL), including lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin and anti-{beta}2-glycoprotein-1 antibodies, and its possible association with thrombotic manifestations of COVID-19.\n\nData SourcesWe searched MEDLINE indexed journals on September 24, 2020 using the tool LitCovid and the pre-print server medRxIV.\n\nStudy SelectionOriginal investigations (cross-sectional studies, cohort studies, case series, and research letters) on COVID-19 and thrombosis were included.\n\nData ExtractionData were independently extracted, and compiled into spreadsheets based on the PRISMA principles.\n\nData SynthesisHospitalized patients with COVID-19 showed a higher prevalence of lupus anticoagulant compared to non-COVID-19 patients. Temporally, lupus anticoagulant was generally positive early in the course of illness, whereas anti-cardiolipin and anti-{beta}2-glycoprotein-1 antibodies appeared to emerge later in the disease. Some patients who were aPL-negative at an early time-point after disease onset became aPL-positive at a later time-point. Lupus anticoagulant was independently associated with thrombosis in 60 COVID-19 patients in New York had who had 32 thrombotic events (8 arterial and 24 venous). In 88 patients in Wuhan, who had more than 20 each of arterial and venous thrombotic events, medium/high positivity for multiple aPL was significantly associated with arterial thrombosis. However, the association of aPL with thrombosis was not evident in reports that had an overall lower number of or predominantly venous thrombotic events. Analysis of pooled patients revealed that aPL were significantly more frequent in COVID-19 patients with stroke than stroke patients in the general population. Furthermore, injection of IgG aPL fractions from COVID-19 patients into mice accelerated venous thrombosis.\n\nLimitationLimited data and paucity of prospective studies.\n\nConclusionThe aPL are prevalent in patients with COVID-19 and their presence is associated with thrombosis. Importantly, these antibodies may be a key mechanism of thrombosis in COVID-19. Follow-up studies are required to understand the relationship between aPL and the spectrum of vascular thrombosis during and after infection with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nPrimary Funding SourceNone.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTransgender and non-binary people are disproportionately burdened by barriers to quality healthcare, mental health challenges, and economic hardship. This study examined the impact of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and subsequent control measures on gender-affirming care, mental health, and economic stability among transgender and non-binary people globally.\n\nMethodsWe collected global cross-sectional data from 964 transgender and non-binary adult users of the Hornet and Her apps from April to August 2020 to characterize changes in gender-affirming care, mental health, and economic stability as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted Poisson regression models to assess if access to gender-affirming care and ability to live according to ones gender were related to depressive symptoms, anxiety, and changes in suicidal ideation.\n\nResultsIndividuals resided in 76 countries, including Turkey (27.4%,n=264/964) and Thailand (20.6%,n=205). A majority were non-binary (66.8%,n=644) or transfeminine (29.4%,n=283). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 55.0% (n=320/582) reported reduced access to gender- affirming resources, and 38.0% (n=327/860) reported reduced time lived according to their gender. About half screened positive for depression (50.4%,442/877) and anxiety (45.8%,n=392/856). One in six (17.0%,n=112/659) expected losses of health insurance, and 77.0% (n=724/940) expected income reductions. The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and increased suicidal ideation were 1.63 (95% CI: 1.36-1.97), 1.61 (95% CI: 1.31-1.97), and 1.74 (95% CI: 1.07-2.82) times higher for individuals whose access to gender- affirming resources was reduced versus not.\n\nDiscussionThe COVID-19 pandemic has reduced access to gender-affirming resources and the ability of transgender and non-binary people to live according to their gender worldwide. These reductions may drive the increased depressive symptoms, anxiety, and suicidal ideation reported in this sample. To improve transgender and non-binary health globally, increased access to gender-affirming resources should be achieved through policies (e.g., digital prescriptions), flexible interventions (e.g., telehealth), and support for existing transgender health initiatives.",

    "abstract": "ImportanceIt is unknown how a lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic impacts childrens and adolescents mental and social health.\n\nObjectiveTo compare mental and social health of children and adolescents during the COVID-19 lockdown versus before, identify associated factors, describe the change in atmosphere at home and qualitatively assess the impact of COVID-19 regulations on daily life.\n\nDesignCross-sectional study comparing two Dutch representative samples of children and adolescents (8-18 years); before COVID-19 (Dec2017-July2018) and during the COVID-19 lockdown (April/May 2020).\n\nSettingPopulation-based\n\nParticipantsChildren and adolescents aged 8-18 years (M=13.4, 47.4% male), representative of the Dutch population on key demographics.\n\nExposure(s)COVID-19 pandemic lockdown\n\nMain Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS(R)) domains: Global Health, Peer Relationships, Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms, Anger and Sleep-Related Impairment. Single item on atmosphere at home and open question regarding the impact of the regulations on the child/adolescents daily life\n\nResultsChildren and adolescents reported significantly worse PROMIS T-scores on all domains (absolute mean difference range, 2.1-7.1; absolute 95% CI range, 1.3-7.9) during the COVID-19 lockdown as compared to before COVID-19. More children reported severe Anxiety (during 16.7% vs. before 8.6%; relative risk 1.95; 95% CI 1.55-2.46) and Sleep-Related Impairment (during 11.5% vs. before 6.1%; relative risk 1.89; 95% CI 1.29-2.78). Fewer children reported poor Global Health (during 1.7 vs. before 4.6%; relative risk 0.36; 95% CI 0.20-0.65). More mental and social health complaints during the COVID-19 lockdown were found in children and adolescents growing up in a single-parent family, having [&ge;]three children in the family, a negative change in work situation of parents due to COVID-19 regulations, and having a relative/friend infected with COVID-19. A small effect was found on atmosphere at home during the lockdown compared to before (mean difference, -3.1; 95% CI, -4.1 --2.1). A large majority (>90%) reported a negative impact of the COVID-19 regulations on their daily life.\n\nConclusions and RelevanceThis study showed that governmental regulations regarding lockdown pose a serious mental and social health threat on children and adolescents that should be brought to the forefront of political decision making and mental health care policy, intervention and prevention.\n\nKey pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the impact of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic on mental and social health in children and adolescents compared to before COVID-19?\n\nFindingsThis population-based study shows that during the COVID-19 lockdown children and adolescents report lower mental and social health, especially on anxiety and depressive symptoms.\n\nMeaningIn proposing new COVID regulations (e.g., closing schools) governments should be mindful of the negative impact of a lockdown on mental and social health of children and adolescents.",

    "abstract": "1In response to COVID-19, the international water community rapidly developed methods to quantify the SARS-CoV-2 genetic signal in untreated wastewater. Wastewater surveillance using such methods has the potential to complement clinical testing in assessing community health. This interlaboratory assessment evaluated the reproducibility and sensitivity of 36 standard operating procedures (SOPs), divided into eight method groups based on sample concentration approach and whether solids were removed. Two raw wastewater samples were collected in August 2020, amended with a matrix spike (betacoronavirus OC43), and distributed to 32 laboratories across the U.S. Replicate samples analyzed in accordance with the projects quality assurance plan showed high reproducibility across the 36 SOPs: 80% of the recovery-corrected results fell within a band of +/- 1.15-log10 genome copies/L with higher reproducibility observed within a single SOP (standard deviation of 0.13-log10). The inclusion of a solids removal step and the selection of a concentration method did not show a clear, systematic impact on the recovery-corrected results. Other methodological variations (e.g., pasteurization, primer set selection, and use of RT-qPCR or RT-dPCR platforms) generally resulted in small differences compared to other sources of variability. These findings suggest that a variety of methods are capable of producing reproducible results, though the same SOP or laboratory should be selected to track SARS-CoV-2 trends at a given facility. The methods showed a 7-log10 range of recovery efficiency and limit of detection highlighting the importance of recovery correction and the need to consider method sensitivity when selecting methods for wastewater surveillance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIntensive Care Unit (ICU), anaesthetic and theatres staff have faced significant challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic which have the potential to adversely affect their mental health\n\nAimsTo identify the rates of probable mental health disorder in ICU and anaesthetic staff in six English hospitals during June and July 2020\n\nMethodsAn anonymised brief web-based survey comprising standardised questionnaires examining depression, anxiety symptoms, symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), wellbeing and alcohol use was administered to staff.\n\nResults709 participants completed the surveys comprising 291 (41%) doctors, 344 (48.5%) nurses, and 74 (10.4%) other healthcare staff. Over half (58.8%) reported good wellbeing, however 45.4% met the threshold for probable clinical significance on at least one of the following measures: severe depression (6.3%), PTSD (39.5%), severe anxiety (11.3%) or problem drinking (7.2%). 13.4% of respondents reported frequent thoughts of being better off dead, or of hurting themselves in the past two weeks. We found that doctors consistently reported better mental health than nurses.\n\nConclusionsWe found substantial rates of probable mental health disorders, and thoughts of self-harm, amongst ICU staff; these difficulties were especially prevalent in nurses.

    "abstract": "We aimed to summarize reliable medical evidence by the meta-analysis of all published clinical trials that investigated the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of vaccine candidates against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and medRxiv databases were used to select the studies. 7094 articles were identified initially and 43 were retrieved for more detailed evaluation. 5 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were selected. A total of 1604 subjects with either vaccines or placebo infections were included in the meta-analysis within the scope of these articles. According to the results, there is an increase in total adverse events for subjects with either low (95% CI: 1.90-4.29) or high (CI: 2.65-5.63) dose vaccination. The adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccine are mainly local ones including pain, itching, and redness, and no significant difference was identified in the systemic reactions. All adverse effects were transient and resolved within a few days. Moreover, the neutralizing and IgG antibody levels post different dose vaccinations were all significantly increased at day 14/21 (P = 0.0004 and P = 0.0003, respectively) and day 28/35 (P < 0.00001) in vaccine groups compared to placebo controls. Besides, the levels of neutralizing and IgG antibodies were also elevated significantly at from day 14 to 35, versus day 0 (All P < 0.001). In conclusion, our analysis suggests that the current COVID-19 vaccine candidates are safe, tolerated, and immunogenic, which provides important information for further development, evaluation, and clinical application of COVID-19 vaccine.",

    "abstract": "AIMWe assessed predictors of in-hospital mortality in people with prediabetes and diabetes hospitalized for COVID-19 infection and developed a risk score for identifying those at the highest risk of a fatal outcome.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODSA combined prospective and retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted in 10 sites in Austria on 247 people with diabetes or newly diagnosed prediabetes, who were hospitalised for COVID-19. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality and predictor variables at the time of admission included clinical data, comorbidities of diabetes or laboratory data. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify significant predictors and develop a risk score for in-hospital mortality.\n\nRESULTSThe mean age of people hospitalized (n=238) for COVID-19 was 71.1 {+/-} 12.9 years, 63.6% were males, 75.6% had type 2 diabetes, 4.6% had type 1 diabetes, and 19.8% had prediabetes. The mean duration of hospital stay was 18 {+/-} 16 days, 23.9% required ventilation therapy, and 24.4% died in the hospital. Mortality rate in people with diabetes was numerically higher (26.7%) as compared to those with prediabetes (14.9%) but without statistical significance (p=0.128). A score including age, arterial occlusive disease, CRP, eGFR and AST levels at admission predicted in-hospital mortality with a C-statistics of 0.889 (95%CI: 0.837 - 0.941) and calibration of 1.000 (p=0.909).\n\nCONCLUSIONSThe in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 was high in people with diabetes and not significantly different to the risk in people with prediabetes. A risk score using five routinely available patient parameters demonstrated excellent predictive performance for assessing in-hospital mortality.",

    "abstract": "Delirium is a serious and common complication among critically ill patients with COVID-19. The objective of this study was to characterize the clinical course of delirium for COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit, including post-discharge cognitive outcomes. A retrospective chart review was conducted for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (n=148) admitted to an intensive care unit at Michigan Medicine between 3/1/2020 and 5/31/2020. Delirium was identified in 107/148 (72%) patients in the study cohort, with median (interquartile range) duration lasting 10 (4 - 17) days. Sedative regimens, inflammation, deviation from delirium prevention protocols, and hypoxic-ischemic injury were likely contributing factors, and the most common disposition for delirious patients was a skilled care facility (41/148, 38%). Among patients who were delirious during hospitalization, 4/17 (24%) later tested positive for delirium at home based on caretaker assessment, 5/22 (23%) demonstrated signs of questionable cognitive impairment or cognitive impairment consistent with dementia, and 3/25 (12%) screened positive for depression within two months after discharge. Overall, patients with COVID-19 commonly experience a prolonged course of delirium in the intensive care unit, likely with multiple contributing factors. Furthermore, neuropsychological impairment may persist after discharge.",

    "abstract": "ImportanceKnowing the transmissibility of asymptomatic infections and risk of infection from household and community exposures is critical to SARS-CoV-2 control. Limited previous evidence is based primarily on virologic testing, which disproportionately misses mild and asymptomatic infections. Serologic measures are more likely to capture all previously infected individuals.\n\nObjectiveEstimate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection from household and community exposures, and identify key risk factors for transmission and infection.\n\nDesignHousehold serosurvey and transmission model.\n\nSettingPopulation-based serosurvey in Geneva, Switzerland\n\nParticipants4,524 household members five years and older from 2,267 households enrolled April-June 2020.\n\nExposuresSARS-CoV-2 infected (seropositive) household members and background risk of community transmission.\n\nMain outcomes and measuresPast SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed through anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by ELISA. Chain-binomial models based on the number of infections within households were used to estimate extra-household infection risk by demographics and reported extra-household contacts, and infection risk from exposure to an infected household member by demographics and infectors symptoms. Infections attributable to exposure to different types of infectious individuals were estimated.\n\nResultsThe chance of being infected by a single SARS-CoV-2 infected household member was 17.2% (95%CrI 13.6-21.5%) compared to a cumulative extra-household infection risk of 5.1% (95%CrI 4.5-5.8%). Infection risk from an infected household member increased with age, from 7.5% (95%CrI 1.3-20.3%) among 5-9 years to 30.2% (95%CrI 14.3-48.2%) among those [&ge;]65 years. Working-age adults (20-49 years) had the highest extra-household infection risk. Seropositive household members not reporting symptoms had 74.8% lower odds (95%CrI 43.8-90.3%) of infecting another household member compared to those reporting symptoms, accounting for 19.6% (95%CrI 12.9-24.5%) of all household infections.\n\nConclusions and RelevanceThe risk of infection from exposure to a single infected household member was four-times that of extra-household exposures over the first wave of the pandemic. Young children had a lower risk from infection from household members. Asymptomatic infections are far less likely to transmit than symptomatic ones but do cause infections. While the small households in Geneva limit the contribution of household spread, household transmission likely plays a greater role in other settings.",

    "abstract": "PurposeResearch is beginning to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on people with pre-existing mental health conditions. Our paper addresses a lack of in-depth qualitative research exploring their experiences and perceptions of how life has changed at this time.\n\nMethodsWe used qualitative interviews (N=49) to explore experiences of the pandemic for people with pre-existing mental health conditions. In a participatory, coproduced approach, researchers with lived experiences of mental health conditions conducted interviews and analysed data as part of a multi-disciplinary research team.\n\nResultsExisting mental health difficulties were exacerbated for many people. People experienced specific psychological impacts of the pandemic, struggles with social connectedness, and inadequate access to mental health services, while some found new ways to cope and connect to community. New remote ways to access mental health care, including digital solutions, provided continuity of care for some but presented substantial barriers for others. People from black and ethnic minority (BAME) communities experienced heightened anxiety, stigma and racism associated with the pandemic, further impacting their mental health.\n\nConclusionThere is a need for evidence-based solutions to achieve accessible and effective mental health care in response to the pandemic, especially remote approaches to care. Further research should explore the long-term impacts of COVID-19 on people with pre-existing mental health conditions. Particular attention should be paid to understanding inequalities of impact on mental health, especially for people from BAME communities.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo evaluate the benefits and risks of any type of zinc intervention to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2.\n\nDesignA living, systematic review and meta-analysis, incorporating rapid review methods.\n\nData sources17 English and Chinese databases and clinical trial registries were searched in April/May 2020, with additional covid-19 focused searches in June and August 2020.\n\nEligibilitycriteria and analysisRandomized control trials (RCTs) published in any language comparing zinc to a control to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2. Other viral respiratory tract infections (RTIs) were included, but the certainty of evidence downgraded twice for indirectness. Screening, data extraction, risk of bias appraisal (RoB-2 tool) and verification was performed by calibrated, single reviewers. RCTs with adult populations were prioritised for analysis.\n\nResults123 RCTs were identified. None were specific to SARS-CoV-2 nor other coronaviruses. 28 RCTs evaluated oral (15-45mg daily), sublingual (45-300mg daily), or topical nasal (0.09-2.6 mg daily) zinc to prevent or treat nonspecific viral RTIs in 3,597 adults without zinc deficiency. Compared to placebo, zinc prevented 5 mild to moderate RTIs per 100 person-months, including in older adults (95% confidence interval 1 to 9) (number needed to treat (NTT)=20). There was no significant difference in the rates of non-serious adverse events (AE). For RTI treatment, a clinically important reduction in peak symptom severity scores was found for zinc compared to placebo (mean difference 1.2 points, 0.7 to 1.7), but not average daily symptom severity (standardised mean difference 0.2, 0.1 to 0.4). 19 fewer per 100 adults were at risk of remaining symptomatic over the first 7 days (2 to 38, NNT=5) and the mean duration of symptoms was 2 days shorter (0.2 to 3.5), however, there was substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 82% and 97%). 14 more per 100 experienced a non-serious AE (4 to 16, NNT=7) such as nausea, or mouth or nasal irritation. No differences in illness duration nor AE were found when zinc was compared to active controls. No serious AE, including copper deficiency, were reported by any RCT. Quality of life outcomes were not assessed. Confidence in these findings for SARS-CoV-2 is very low due to serious indirectness and some concerns about bias for most outcomes.\n\nConclusionsZinc is a potential therapeutic candidate for preventing and treating SARS-CoV-2, including older adults and adults without zinc deficiency (very low certainty). Zinc may also help to prevent other viral RTIs during the pandemic (moderate certainty) and reduce the severity and duration of symptoms (very low certainty). The pending results from seven RCTs evaluating zinc for SARS-CoV-2 will be tracked.\n\nSystematic review registrationPROSPERO CRD42020182044",

    "abstract": "At least since March 2020, the multiorgan disease COVID-19 has a firm grip on the world. Although most of the cases are mild, patients from risk populations could develop a cytokine storm, which is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and organ failure. The present paper will introduce the small molecule MP1032, describe its mode of action, and give rationale why it is a promising option for prevention/treatment of SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm. MP1032 is a phase-pure anhydrous polymorph of 5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-pthalazinedione sodium salt that exhibits good stability and bioavailability. The physiological action of MP1032 is based on a multi-target mechanism including localized, self-limiting antioxidant activities that were demonstrated in a model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced joint inflammation. Furthermore, immune-regulatory and PARP-1 modulating properties, coupled with antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 were shown in various cell models. Efficacy has been preclinically elucidated in LPS-induced endotoxemia, a model with excessively activated immune responses that shares many similarities to COVID-19. So far, during oral clinical development with three-months daily administrations, no serious adverse drug reactions occurred highlighting the outstanding safety profile of MP1032.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has become a major public health issue worldwide. Developing and evaluating rapid and easy-to-perform diagnostic tests is an absolute priority. The current prospective study was designed to assess diagnostic performances of an antigen-based rapid detection test (COVID-VIRO(R)) in a real-life setting.\n\nMethodsTwo nasopharyngeal specimens of symptomatic or asymptomatic adult patients hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases Department or voluntarily accessing the COVID-19 Screening Department of the Regional Hospital of Orleans, France, were concurrently collected. COVID VIRO(R) diagnostic specificity and sensitivity were assessed in comparison to real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results. A subgroup of patients underwent an additional oropharyngeal and/or a saliva swab for rapid testing.\n\nResults121 patients already having a confirmed infection and 127 patients having no evidence of recent or ongoing infection were enrolled, for a total of 248 couple of nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Overall COVID-VIRO(R) sensitivity was 96.7% (IC: 93.5%-99.9%). In asymptomatic patients, patients having symptoms for more than 4 days and those having a RT-qPCR Cycle threshold value >32, sensitivity was of 100%, 95.8% and 96.9% respectively. The concordance between RT-qPCR and COVID VIRO(R) rapid test was 100% for the 127 patients with no SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nConclusionCOVID-VIRO(R) test had 100% specificity and above 95% sensitivity, better than WHO recommendations (specificity [&ge;]97-100%, sensitivity [&ge;]80%). These rapid tests are particularly interesting for large-scale screening in Emergency Department, low resource settings and airports.",

    "abstract": "In December 2019, the outbreak of corona virus disease, also known as COVID-19, was first reported in Wuhan, China [1]. Within only one month, the disease quickly spread to the United States through the transmission of respiratory droplets released when an infected individual sneezes or coughs [2]. Throughout the course of 9 months, the US reported over 8 million cases and 204,000 deaths, affecting the daily lives of American citizens [3]. As trends in corona virus cases are changing daily, its important to monitor these trends and observe the causes for the increase and decrease in new cases. The trends in new corona virus cases in the US as well as New Jersey are simulated using a modified Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. The new case graphs from the simulations reflect the new case trends in both the US and New Jersey and can be used to understand the mechanism behind the rates of corona virus infection as well as predict future corona virus trends. Comparisons between the results of the simulations and observed data show the effectiveness of control measures such as quarantine, physical distancing, and wearing masks. The extended time period of control measures taken in New Jersey led to a gradual decline in new cases reported daily while the US new cases showed a second wave of growth after control measures were implemented to a lesser extent.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for noninvasive respiratory support devices has dramatically increased, sometimes exceeding hospital capacity. The full-face Decathlon snorkeling mask, EasyBreath(R) (EB(R) mask), has been adapted to deliver continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) as an emergency respiratory interface. We aimed to assess the performance of this modified EB(R) mask.\n\nMethodsCPAP set at 5, 10, and 15 cmH2O was delivered to 10 healthy volunteers with a high-flow system generator set at 40, 80, and 120 L min-1 and with a turbine-driven ventilator during both spontaneous and loaded (resistor) breathing. Inspiratory CO2 partial pressure (PiCO2), pressure inside the mask, breathing pattern and electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) were measured at all combinations of CPAP/flows delivered, with and without the resistor.\n\nResultsUsing the high-flow generator set at 40 L min-1, the PiCO2 significantly increased and the system was unable to maintain the target CPAP of 10 and 15 cmH2O and a stable pressure within the respiratory cycle; conversely, the turbine-driven ventilator did. EAdi significantly increased with flow rates of 40 and 80 L min-1 but not at 120 L min-1 and with the turbine-driven ventilator.\n\nConclusionsEB(R) mask can be safely used to deliver CPAP only under strict constraints, using either a high-flow generator at a flow rate greater than 80 L min-1, or a high-performance turbine-driven ventilator.",

    "abstract": "The national COVID-19 conversation in the US has mostly focused on urban areas, without sufficient examination of another geography with large vulnerable populations: the suburbs. While suburbs are often thought of as areas of uniform affluence and racial homogeneity, over the past 20 years, poverty and diversity have increased substantially in the suburbs. In this study, we compare geographic and temporal trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths in Louisiana, one of the few states with high rates of COVID-19 during both the spring and summer. We find that incidence and mortality rates were initially highest in New Orleans. By the second peak, trends reversed: suburban areas experienced higher rates than New Orleans and similar rates to other urban and rural areas. We also find that increased social vulnerability was associated with increased positivity and incidence during the first peak. During the second peak, these associations reversed in New Orleans while persisting in other urban, suburban, and rural areas. The work draws attention to the high rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths in suburban areas and the importance of metropolitan-wide actions to address COVID-19.\n\nRegistrationN/A\n\nFunding sourceNIH (DP5OD26429) and RWJF (77644)\n\nCode and data availabilityCode for replication along with data is available here: https://github.com/alinasmahl1/COVID_Louisiana_Suburban/.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesTo determine the impact of restrictions on mobility on reducing transmission of COVID-19.\n\nDesignDaily incidence rates lagged by 14 days were regressed on mobility changes using LOESS regression and logit regression between the day of the 100th case in each country to August 31, 2020.\n\nSetting34 OECD countries plus Singapore and Taiwan.\n\nParticipantsGoogle mobility data were obtained from people who turned on mobile device-based global positioning system (GPS) and agreed to share their anonymized position information with Google.\n\nInterventionsWe examined the association of COVID-19 incidence rates with mobility changes, defined as changes in categories of domestic location, against a pre-pandemic baseline, using country-specific daily incidence data on newly confirmed COVID-19 cases and mobility data.\n\nResultsIn two thirds of examined countries, reductions of up to 40% in commuting mobility (to workplaces, transit stations, retailers, and recreation) were associated with decreased COVID-19 incidence, more so early in the pandemic. However, these decreases plateaued as mobility remained low or decreased further. We found smaller or negligible associations between mobility restriction and incidence rates in the late phase in most countries.\n\nConclusionMild to moderate degrees of mobility restriction in most countries were associated with reduced incidence rates of COVID-19 that appear to attenuate over time, while some countries exhibited no effect of such restrictions. More detailed research is needed to precisely understand the benefits and limitations of mobility restrictions as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICSince SARS-CoV-2 became a pandemic, restrictions on mobility such as limitations on travel and closure of offices, restaurants, and shops have been imposed in an unprecedented way in both scale and scope to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the absence of effective treatment options or a vaccine. Although mobility restriction has also brought about tremendous costs such as negative economic growth and other collateral impacts on health such as increased morbidity and mortality from lack of access to other essential health services, little evidence exists on the effectiveness of mobility restriction for the prevention of disease transmission. A search of PUBMED and Google Scholar for publications on this topic through Sep 20, 2020 revealed that most of the evidence on the effectiveness of physical distancing comes from mathematical modeling studies using a variety of assumptions. One study investigated only the combined effect of several interventions, including physical distancing, among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.\n\nWHAT THIS STUDY ADDSThis is the first study to investigate the association between change in mobility and incidence of COVID-19 globally using real-time measures of mobility at the population level. For this, we used Google Global Mobility data and the daily incidence of COVID-19 for 36 countries from the day of 100th case detection through August 31, 2020. Our findings from LOESS regression show that in two-thirds of countries, reductions of up to 40% in commuting mobility were associated with decreased COVID-19 incidence, more so early in the pandemic. This decrease, however, plateaued as mobility decreased further. We found that associations between mobility restriction and incidence became smaller or negligible in the late phase of the pandemic in most countries. The reduced incidence rate of COVID-19 cases with a mild to moderate degree of mobility restriction in most countries suggests some value to limited mobility restriction in early phases of epidemic mitigation. The lack of impact in some others, however, suggests further research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the distinguishing factors for when mobility restrictions are helpful in decreasing viral transmission. Governments should carefully consider the level and period of mobility restriction necessary to achieve the desired benefits and minimize harm.",

The special capital region of Jakarta is the only province among 34 provinces in Indonesia with an average Testing Positivity Rate (TPR) below 5% recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). The transmission model is based on a discrete-time compartmental epidemiological model incorporating suspected cases. The quantitative evaluation is measured based on the estimation of the time-varying effective reproduction number ([R]t). Our results show the LSSR has been successfully suppressed the spread of COVID-19 in Jakarta, which was indicated by [R]t < 1. However, once the LSSR was relaxed, the effective reproduction number increased significantly. The model is further used for short-term forecasting to mitigate the course of the pandemic.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRemdesivir (RDV) is the only antiviral drug registered currently for treatment of COVID-19 after a few clinical trials with controversial results. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of RDV in patients with COVID-19 in real world settings.\n\nMethodsPatients were selected from 1496 individuals included in the SARSTer national database; 122 of them received therapy with RDV and 211 were treated with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-based therapy. The primary end-point of effectiveness was clinical improvement in the ordinal 8-point scale, which was defined as a 2-point decrease from baseline to 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of hospitalization. The secondary end-points of effectiveness included: death rate, rate of no clinical improvement within 28 days of hospitalization in the ordinal scale, rate of the need for constant oxygen therapy, duration of oxygen therapy, rate of the need for mechanical ventilation, total hospitalization time, and rate of positive RT PCR for SARS-CoV-2 after 30 days.\n\nFindingsSignificantly higher rates of clinical improvement, by 15% and 10% respectively, were observed after RDV treatment compared to LPV/r at days 21 and 28. The difference between regimens increased with worsening of oxygen saturation (SpO2) and depending on the baseline score from the ordinal scale. Statistically significant differences supporting RDV were also noted regarding the rate of no clinical improvement within 28 days of hospitalization and hospitalization duration in patients with baseline SpO2 [&le;]90%. In the logistic regression model only the administration of remdesivir was independently associated with at least a 2-point improvement in the ordinal scale between baseline and day 21.\n\nInterpretationIn conclusion, data collected in this retrospective, observational, real world study supported use of remdesivir for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection particularly in patients with oxygen saturation [&le;]95%.",

    "abstract": "The ambient conditions surrounding liquid droplets determine their growth or shrinkage. However, the precise fate of a liquid droplet expelled from a respiratory puff as dictated by its surroundings and the puff itself has not yet been fully quantified. From the view of airborne disease transmission, such as SARS-CoV-2, knowledge of such dependencies are critical. Here we employ direct numerical simulations (DNS) of a turbulent respiratory vapour puff and account for the mass and temperature exchange with respiratory droplets and aerosols. In particular, we investigate how droplets respond to different ambient temperatures and relative humidity (RH) by tracking their Lagrangian statistics. We reveal and quantify that in cold and humid environments, as there the respiratory puff is supersaturated, expelled droplets can first experience significant growth, and only later followed by shrinkage, in contrast to the monotonic shrinkage of droplets as expected from the classical view by William F. Wells (1934). Indeed, cold and humid environments diminish the ability of air to hold water vapour, thus causing the respiratory vapour puff to super-saturate. Consequently, the super-saturated vapour field drives the growth of droplets that are caught and transported within the humid puff. To analytically predict the likelihood for droplet growth, we propose a model for the axial RH based on the assumption of a quasi-stationary jet. Our model correctly predicts super-saturated RH conditions and is in good quantitative agreement with our DNS. Our results culminate in a temperature-RH map that can be employed as an indicator for droplet growth or shrinkage.\n\nSignificance StatementInfluence of environmental conditions on airborne diseases transmission is an important issue, especially during the pandemic of COVID-19. Human-to-human transmission is mediated by the transport of virus-laden respiratory droplets. Here we investigate the problem from a fluid mechanics perspective by conducting numerical simulations to quantify the fate of respiratory droplets in a warm humid coughing puff under different ambient conditions. We reveal a non-intuitive regime with considerable growth of respiratory droplets, dominated by a super-saturated vapour field, preferentially occurring in cold and humid environments. We further propose a theoretical model that accurately predicts the condition for droplet growth. Our work should inform socializing policies and ventilation strategies for controlling indoor ambient conditions to mitigate dispersion of droplets from asymptomatic individuals.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundQuantifying occupational risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers can inform efforts to improve healthcare worker and patient safety and reduce transmission. This study aimed to quantify demographic, occupational, and community risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among healthcare workers in a large metropolitan healthcare system.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed data from a cross-sectional survey conducted from April through June of 2020 linking risk factors for occupational and community exposure to COVID-19 with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. A multivariable logistic regression model was fit to quantify risk factors for infection. Participants were employees and medical staff members who elected to participate in SARS-CoV-2 serology testing offered to all healthcare workers as part of a quality initiative, and who completed a survey on exposure to COVID-19 and use of personal protective equipment. Exposures of interest included known demographic risk factors for COVID-19, residential zip code incidence of COVID-19, occupational exposure to PCR test-positive healthcare workers or patients, and use of personal protective equipment. The primary outcome of interest was SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity.\n\nResultsSARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was estimated to be 5.7% (95% CI: 5.2%-6.1%) among 10,275 healthcare workers. Community contact with a person known or suspected to have COVID-19 (aOR=1.9, 95% CI:1.4-2.5) and zip code level COVID-19 incidence (aOR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0-2.0) increased the odds of infection. Black individuals were at high risk (aOR=2.0, 95% CI:1.6-2.4). Overall, occupational risk factors accounted for 27% (95% CI: 25%-30%) of the risk among healthcare workers and included contact with a PCR test-positive healthcare worker (aOR=1.2, 95% CI:1.0-1.6).\n\nConclusionsCommunity risk factors, including contact with a COVID-19 positive individual and residential COVID-19 incidence, are more strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among healthcare workers than exposure in the workplace.",

    "abstract": "Rapid tests to evaluate SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses are urgently needed to decipher protective immunity and aid monitoring vaccine-induced immunity. Using a rapid whole blood assay requiring minimal amount of blood, we measured qualitatively and quantitatively SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell responses in 31 healthcare workers, using flow cytometry. 100% of COVID-19 convalescent participants displayed a detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell response. SARS-CoV-2-responding cells were also detected in 40.9% of participants with no COVID-19-associated symptoms or who tested PCR negative. Phenotypic assessment indicated that, in COVID-19 convalescent participants, SARS-CoV-2 CD4 responses displayed an early differentiated memory phenotype with limited capacity to produce IFN{gamma}. Conversely, in participants with no reported symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 CD4 responses were enriched in late differentiated cells, co-expressing IFN{gamma} and TNF and also Granzyme B. This proof of concept study presents a scalable alternative to PBMC-based assays to enumerate and phenotype SARS-CoV-2-responding T cells, thus representing a practical tool to monitor adaptive immunity in vaccine trials.\n\nSummaryIn this proof of concept study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses are easily detectable using a rapid whole blood assay requiring minimal blood volume. Such assay could represent a suitable tool to monitor adaptive immunity in vaccine trials.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare professionals (HCPs) are at the frontline in the fight against COVID-19 and are at an increased risk of becoming infected with coronavirus. Risk of infection can be minimized by use of proper personal protective equipment (PPE). This study assessed the availability of PPE and satisfaction of HCPs in six public hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted from 9th to 26th June 2020. The study hospitals included: Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Zewditu Memorial Hospital, Ghandi Memorial Hospital, Menelik II Hospital, Yekatit 12 Hospital Medical College and St. Paul Hospital Millennium Medical College. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the data and Chi-square test was used to assess the association between the groups. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with the satisfaction level of healthcare workers with regard to the availability and use of proper PPE during the current COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1,134 (92.3%) valid questionnaires from a possible 1,228 were included in the analysis. The mean ({+/-}SD) age of the participants was 30.26{+/-}6.43 year and 52.6% were females. Nurses constituted about 40% of the overall sample, followed by physicians (22.2%), interns (10.8%), midwives (10.3%) and others (16.7%). An overall shortage of PPE was reported in all study hospitals. The majority (77%) of the healthcare professionals reported that their hospital did not have adequate PPE. A critical shortage of N95 respirator was particularly reported, the self-reported availability of N95 increased from 13% to 24% before and during COVID-19, respectively. The self-reported use of N95 increased from 9% to 21% before and during COVID-19, respectively. Almost 72% of the respondents were dissatisfied with the availability of PPE in their hospital. The independent predictors of the respondents satisfaction level about PPE were male gender (adjusted OR=1.39, 95% CI:1.05-1.85), healthcare workers who reported that PPE was adequately available in the hospital (adjusted OR=7.53, 95% CI:5.08-11.16), and preparedness to provide care to COVID-19 cases (adjusted OR=1.65, 95% CI:1.22-2.12). A critical shortage of appropriate PPE both before and during COVID-19 was identified. The high level of dissatisfaction with the availability of PPE might potentially lead to a lower level of preparedness and readiness to fight against COVID-19. Therefore, urgent efforts are needed to adequately supply the healthcare facilities with appropriate PPE to alleviate the challenges.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare professionals are at higher risk of contracting the novel coronavirus due to their work exposure in the healthcare settings. Practicing appropriate preventive measures to control COVID-19 infection is one of the most important interventions that healthcare workers are expected to use. The aim of this study was to assess the level of risk perception and practices of preventive measures of COVID-19 among health workers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 9th to 26th June 2020 among healthcare professionals working at six public hospitals in Addis Ababa. Data were collected using a self-administered structured questionnaire. Frequency, percentage, and mean were used to summarize the data. A binary logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with risk perception about COVID-19. A total of 1,134 participants were surveyed. Wearing facemask (93%), hand washing for at least 20 seconds (93%), covering mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing (91%), and avoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth (91%) were the commonly self-reported preventive practices. About 88% perceived that they were worried about the risk of becoming infected with coronavirus, and majority (91%) worried about the risk of infection to their family. The mean score of overall fear and worry of COVID-19 was 2.37 on a scale of 1 to 3. Respondents who ever provided clinical care to COVID-19 patients were more likely to report fear and worry (adjusted OR=1.34, 95% CI:1.02-1.91), however those who ever participated in Ebola or SARS outbreaks were less likely to report fear and worry due to COVID-19 crisis (adjusted OR=0.66, 95% CI:0.48-0.90). This study has revealed widespread practices of preventive measures and the highest perceived risk of COVID-19 among healthcare workers. Therefore, an effective risk communication intervention should be implemented to ensure the maintenance of appropriate practices during the current COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, gay and other men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States (US) report similar or fewer sexual partners and reduced HIV testing and care access. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use has declined. We estimated the potential impact of COVID-19 on HIV incidence and mortality among US MSM.\n\nMethodsWe used a calibrated HIV transmission model for MSM in Baltimore, Maryland, and available data on COVID-19-related disruptions to predict impacts of data-driven reductions in sexual partners(0%,25%,50%), condom use(5%), HIV testing(20%), viral suppression(10%), PrEP initiations(72%), PrEP use(9%) and ART initiations(50%), exploring different disruption durations and magnitudes. We estimated the median (95% credible interval) change in cumulative new HIV infections and deaths among MSM over one and five years, compared with a scenario without COVID-19-related disruptions.\n\nFindingsA six-month 25% reduction in sexual partners among Baltimore MSM, without HIV service changes, could reduce new HIV infections by 12{middle dot}2%(11{middle dot}7,12{middle dot}8%) and 3{middle dot}0%(2{middle dot}6,3{middle dot}4%) over one and five years, respectively. In the absence of changes in sexual behaviour, the six-month data-driven disruptions to condom use, testing, viral suppression, PrEP initiations, PrEP use and ART initiations combined were predicted to increase new HIV infections by 10{middle dot}5%(5{middle dot}8,16{middle dot}5%) over one year, and by 3{middle dot}5%(2{middle dot}1,5{middle dot}4%) over five years. A 25% reduction in partnerships offsets the negative impact of these combined service disruptions on new HIV infections (overall reduction 3{middle dot}9%(-1{middle dot}0,7{middle dot}4%), 0{middle dot}0%(-1{middle dot}4,0{middle dot}9%) over one, five years, respectively), but not on HIV deaths (corresponding increases 11{middle dot}0%(6{middle dot}2,17{middle dot}7%), 2{middle dot}6%(1{middle dot}5,4{middle dot}3%)). The predicted impacts of reductions in partnerships or viral suppression doubled if they lasted 12 months or if disruptions were twice as large.\n\nInterpretationMaintaining access to ART and adherence support is of the utmost importance to minimise excess HIV-related mortality due to COVID-19 restrictions in the US, even if accompanied by reductions in sexual partnerships.\n\nFundingNIH\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe COVID-19 pandemic and responses to it have disrupted HIV prevention and treatment services and led to changes in sexual risk behaviour in the United States, but the overall potential impact on HIV transmission and HIV-related mortality is not known. We searched PubMed for articles documenting COVID-related disruptions to HIV prevention and treatment and changes in sexual risk behaviour in the United States, published between 1st January and 7th October 2020, with no language restrictions, using the terms COVID* AND (HIV OR AIDS) AND (\"United States\" OR US). We identified three cross-sectional surveys assessing changes in sexual risk behaviour among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States, one finding a reduction, one a slight increase, and one no change in partner numbers during COVID-19 restrictions. Two of these studies also found reductions in reported HIV testing, HIV care and/or access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among MSM due to COVID-19. A separate study from a San Francisco clinic found declines in viral suppression among its clients during lockdown. We searched PubMed for articles estimating the impact of COVID-related disruptions on HIV transmission and mortality published between 1st January 2020 and 12th October 2020, with no language restrictions, using the following terms: COVID* AND model* AND (HIV OR AIDS). We identified two published studies which had used mathematical modelling to estimate the impact of hypothetical COVID-19-related disruptions to HIV programmes on HIV-related deaths and/or new HIV infections in Africa, another published study using modelling to estimate the impact of COVID-19-related disruptions and linked HIV and SARS-CoV-2 testing on new HIV infections in six cities in the United States, and a pre-print reporting modelling of the impact of COVID-19-related disruptions on HIV incidence among men who have sex with men in Atlanta, United States. None of these studies were informed by data on the size of these disruptions. The two African studies and the Atlanta study assessed the impact of disruptions to different healthcare disruptions separately, and all found that the greatest negative impacts on new HIV infections and/or deaths would arise from interruptions to antiretroviral therapy. They all found smaller effects on HIV-related mortality and/or incidence from other healthcare disruptions, including HIV testing, PrEP use and condom supplies. The United States study assessing the impact of linked HIV and SARS-CoV-2 testing estimated that this could substantially reduce HIV incidence.\n\nAdded value of this studyWe used mathematical modelling to derive estimates of the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions on HIV incidence and mortality among MSM in the United States, directly informed by data from the United States on disruptions to HIV testing, antiretroviral therapy and pre-exposure prophylaxis services and reported changes in sexual risk behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also assessed the impact of an HIV testing campaign during COVID-19 lockdown.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceIn the United States, maintaining access to antiretroviral therapy and adherence support for both existing and new users will be crucial to minimize excess HIV-related deaths arising from the COVID-19 pandemic among men who have sex with men. While reductions in sexual risk behaviour may offset increases in new HIV infections arising from disruptions to HIV prevention and treatment services, this will not offset the additional HIV-related deaths which are also predicted to occur. There are mixed findings on the impact of an HIV testing campaign among US MSM during COVID-19 lockdown. Together, these studies highlight the importance of maintaining effective HIV treatment provision during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Classification and early detection of severe COVID-19 patients is urgently required to establish an effective treatment. Here, we tested the utility of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to classify and predict the severity of COVID-19 in a clinical setting. We used this technology to analyse the mass spectra profiles of the sera from 80 COVID-19 patients, clinically classified as mild (33), severe (26) and critical (21), and 20 healthy controls. We found a clear variability of the serum peptidome profile depending on COVID-19 severity. Seventy-eight peaks were significantly different and 12 at least four fold more intense in the set of critical patients than in the mild ones. Analysis of the resulting matrix of peak intensities by machine learning approaches classified severe (severe and critical) and non-severe (mild) patients with a 90% of accuracy. Furthermore, machine learning predicted correctly the favourable outcome of the severe patients in 85% of the cases and the unfavourable in 38% of the cases. Finally, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis of sera identified five proteins that were significantly upregulated in the critical patients. They included serum amyloid proteins A1 and A2, which probably yielded the most intense peaks with m/z 11,530 and 11,686 detected by MALDI-TOF MS.\n\nIn summary, we demonstrated the potential of the MALDI-TOF MS as a bench to bedside technology to aid clinicians in their decisions to classify COVID-19 patients and predict their evolution.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIvermectin is one among several potential drugs explored for its therapeutic and preventive role in COVID-19 infection. The study was aimed to explore the association between ivermectin prophylaxis and development of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers.\n\nMethodsA hospital-based matched case-control study was conducted among healthcare workers of AIIMS Bhubaneswar, India, from September to October 2020. Profession, gender, age and date of diagnosis were matched for 186 case-control pairs. Cases and controls were healthcare workers who tested positive and negative, respectively, for COVID-19 by RT-PCR. Exposure was defined as the intake of ivermectin and/or hydroxychloroquine and/or vitamin-C and/or other prophylaxis for COVID-19. Data collection and entry was done in Epicollect5, and analysis was performed using STATA version 13. Conditional logistic regression models were used to describe the associated factors for COVID-19 infection.\n\nResultsIvermectin prophylaxis was taken by 77 controls and 38 cases. Two-dose ivermectin prophylaxis (0.27, 95% CI, 0.15-0.51) was associated with 73% reduction of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers for the following one month, those who were involved in physical activity (3.06 95% CI, 1.18-7.93) for more than an hour/day were more likely to contract COVID-19 infection. Type of household, COVID duty, single-dose ivermectin prophylaxis, vitamin-C prophylaxis and hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis were not associated with COVID-19 infection.\n\nConclusionTwo-dose ivermectin prophylaxis at a dose of 300 g/kg with a gap of 72 hours was associated 73% reduction of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers for the following one-month. Further research is required before its large scale use.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundREACT-1 measures prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in representative samples of the population in England using PCR testing from self-administered nose and throat swabs. Here we report interim results for round 6 of observations for swabs collected from the 16th to 25th October 2020 inclusive.\n\nMethodsREACT-1 round 6 aims to collect data and swab results from 160,000 people aged 5 and above. Here we report results from the first 86,000 individuals. We estimate prevalence of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, reproduction numbers (R) and temporal trends using exponential growth or decay models. Prevalence estimates are presented both unweighted and weighted to be representative of the population of England, accounting for response rate, region, deprivation and ethnicity. We compare these interim results with data from round 5, based on swabs collected from 18th September to 5th October 2020 inclusive.\n\nResultsOverall prevalence of infection in the community in England was 1.28% or 128 people per 10,000, up from 60 per 10,000 in the previous round. Infections were doubling every 9.0 (6.1, 18) days with a national reproduction number (R) estimated at 1.56 (1.27, 1.88) compared to 1.16 (1.05, 1.27) in the previous round. Prevalence of infection was highest in Yorkshire and The Humber at 2.72% (2.12%, 3.50%), up from 0.84% (0.60%, 1.17%), and the North West at 2.27% (1.90%, 2.72%), up from 1.21% (1.01%, 1.46%), and lowest in South East at 0.55% (0.45%, 0.68%), up from 0.29% (0.23%, 0.37%). Clustering of cases was more prevalent in Lancashire, Manchester, Liverpool and West Yorkshire, West Midlands and East Midlands. Interim estimates of R were above 2 in the South East, East of England, London and South West, but with wide confidence intervals. Nationally, prevalence increased across all age groups with the greatest increase in those aged 55-64 at 1.20% (0.99%, 1.46%), up 3-fold from 0.37% (0.30%, 0.46%). In those aged over 65, prevalence was 0.81% (0.58%, 0.96%) up 2-fold from 0.35% (0.28%, 0.43%). Prevalence remained highest in 18 to 24-year olds at 2.25% (1.47%, 3.42%).\n\nConclusionThe co-occurrence of high prevalence and rapid growth means that the second wave of the epidemic in England has now reached a critical stage. Whether via regional or national measures, it is now time-critical to control the virus and turn R below one if further hospital admissions and deaths from COVID-19 are to be avoided.",

    "abstract": "In this work we propose a delay differential equation as a lumped parameter or compartmental infectious disease model featuring high descriptive and predictive capability, extremely high adaptability and low computational requirement. Whereas the model has been developed in the context of COVID-19, it is general enough to be applicable mutatis mutandis to other diseases as well. Our fundamental modeling philosophy consists of a decoupling of public health intervention effects, immune response effects and intrinsic infection properties into separate terms. All parameters in the model are directly related to the disease and its management; we can measure or calculate their values a priori basis our knowledge of the phenomena involved, instead of having to extrapolate them from solution curves. Our model can accurately predict the effects of applying or withdrawing interventions, individually or in combination, and can quickly accommodate any newly released information regarding, for example, the infection properties and the immune response to an emerging infectious disease. After demonstrating that the baseline model can successfully explain the COVID-19 case trajectories observed all over the world, we systematically show how the model can be expanded to account for heterogeneous transmissibility, detailed contact tracing drives, mass testing endeavours and immune responses featuring different combinations of limited-time sterilizing immunity, severity-reducing immunity and antibody dependent enhancement.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 has highlighted social and health injustices in the US. Structural inequalities have increased the likelihood of immigrants contracting COVID-19, by being essential workers and through poverty that forces this population to continue working. Rural and urban immigrant families may face different concerns. Using a telephone survey in May 2020 of 105 Latinx families in an existing study, quantitative and qualitative data were gathered on work and household economics, childcare and education, healthcare, and community climate. Analyses show that, although rural and urban groups experienced substantial economic effects, impacts were more acute for urban families. Rural workers reported fewer workplace protective measures for COVID-19. For both groups, fear and worry, particularly about finances and children, dominated reports of their situations with numerous reports of experiencing stress and anxiety. The experience of the pandemic is interpreted as an example of contextual vulnerability of a population already experiencing structural violence through social injustice.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundClose contact with children may provide cross-reactive immunity to SARs-CoV-2 due to more frequent prior coryzal infections from seasonal coronaviruses. Alternatively, close contact with children may increase risk of SARs-CoV-2 infection. We investigated whether risk of infection with SARs-CoV-2 and severe outcomes differed between adults living with and without children.\n\nMethodsWorking on behalf of NHS England, we conducted a population-based cohort study using primary care data and pseudonymously-linked hospital and intensive care admissions, and death records, from patients registered in general practices representing 40% of England. Using multivariable Cox regression, we calculated fully-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of outcomes from 1st February-3rd August 2020 comparing adults living with and without children in the household.\n\nFindingsAmong 9,157,814 adults [&le;]65 years, living with children 0-11 years was not associated with increased risks of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 related hospital or ICU admission but was associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 death (HR 0.75, 95%CI 0.62-0.92). Living with children aged 12-18 years was associated with a small increased risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection (HR 1.08, 95%CI 1.03-1.13), but not associated with other COVID-19 outcomes. Living with children of any age was also associated with lower risk of dying from non-COVID-19 causes. Among 2,567,671 adults >65 years there was no association between living with children and outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2. We observed no consistent changes in risk following school closure.\n\nInterpretationFor adults living with children there is no evidence of an increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. These findings have implications for determining the benefit-harm balance of children attending school in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFundingThis work was supported by the Medical Research Council MR/V015737/1.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched MEDLINE on 19th October 2020 for population-based epidemiological studies comparing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease in people living with and without children. We searched for articles published in 2020, with abstracts available, and terms \"(children or parents or dependants) AND (COVID or SARS-CoV-2 or coronavirus) AND (rate or hazard or odds or risk), in the title, abstract or keywords. 244 papers were identified for screening but none were relevant. One additional study in preprint was identified on medRxiv and found a reduced risk of hospitalisation for COVID-19 and a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection among adult healthcare workers living with children.\n\nAdded value of this studyThis is the first population-based study to investigate whether the risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes from COVID-19 differ between adults living in households with and without school-aged children during the UK pandemic. Our findings show that for adults living with children there is no evidence of an increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes although there may be a slightly increased risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection for working-age adults living with children aged 12 to 18 years. Working-age adults living with children 0 to 11 years have a lower risk of death from COVID-19 compared to adults living without children, with the effect size being comparable to their lower risk of death from any cause. We observed no consistent changes in risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes from COVID-19 comparing periods before and after school closure.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceOur results demonstrate no evidence of serious harms from COVID-19 to adults in close contact with children, compared to those living in households without children. This has implications for determining the benefit-harm balance of children attending school in the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundConcerns have been raised that the response to the UK COVID-19 pandemic may have worsened physical and mental health, and reduced use of health services. However, the scale of the problem is unquantified, impeding development of effective mitigations. We asked what has happened to general practice contacts for acute physical and mental health outcomes during the pandemic?\n\nMethodsUsing electronic health records from the Clinical Research Practice Datalink (CPRD) Aurum (2017-2020), we calculated weekly primary care contacts for selected acute physical and mental health conditions (including: anxiety, depression, acute alcohol-related events, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] exacerbations, cardiovascular and diabetic emergencies). We used interrupted time series (ITS) analysis to formally quantify changes in conditions after the introduction of population-wide restrictions ( lockdown) compared to the period prior to their introduction in March 2020.\n\nFindingsThe overall population included 9,863,903 individuals on 1st January 2017. Primary care contacts for all conditions dropped dramatically after introduction of population-wide restrictions. By July 2020, except for unstable angina and acute alcohol-related events, contacts for all conditions had not recovered to pre-lockdown levels. The largest reductions were for contacts for: diabetic emergencies (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.25-0.50), depression (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.52-0.53), and self-harm (OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.54-0.58).\n\nInterpretationThere were substantial reductions in primary care contacts for acute physical and mental conditions with restrictions, with limited recovery by July 2020. It is likely that much of the deficit in care represents unmet need, with implications for subsequent morbidity and premature mortality. The conditions we studied are sufficiently severe that any unmet need will have substantial ramifications for the people experiencing the conditions and healthcare provision. Maintaining access must be a key priority in future public health planning (including further restrictions).\n\nFundingWellcome Trust Senior Fellowship (SML), Health Data Research UK.\n\nRESULTS IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSA small study in 47 GP practices in a largely deprived, urban area of the UK (Salford) reported that primary care consultations for four broad diagnostic groups (circulatory disease, common mental health problems, type 2 diabetes mellitus and malignant cancer) declined by 16-50% between March and May 2020, compared to what was expected based on data from January 2010 to March 2020. We searched Medline for other relevant evidence of the indirect effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical and mental health from inception to September 25th 2020, for articles published in English, with titles including the search terms (\"covid*\" or \"coronavirus\" or \"sars-cov-2\"), and title or abstracts including the search terms (\"indirect impact\" or \"missed diagnos*\" or \"missing diagnos*\" or \"delayed diagnos*\" or ((\"present*\" or \"consult*\" or \"engag*\" or \"access*\") AND (\"reduction\" or \"decrease\" or \"decline\")). We found no further studies investigating the change in primary care contacts for specific physical- and mental-health conditions indirectly resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or its control measures. There has been a reduction in hospital admissions and presentations to accident and emergency departments in the UK, particularly for myocardial infarctions and cerebrovascular accidents. However, there is no published evidence specifically investigating the changes in primary care contacts for severe acute physical and mental health conditions.\n\nAdded value of this studyTo our knowledge this is the first study to explore changes in healthcare contacts for acute physical and mental health conditions in a large population representative of the UK. We used electronic primary care health records of nearly 10 million individuals across the UK to investigate the indirect impact of COVID-19 on primary care contacts for mental health, acute alcohol-related events, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, and cardiovascular and diabetic emergencies up to July 2020. For all conditions studied, we found primary care contacts dropped dramatically following the introduction of population-wide restriction measures in March 2020. By July 2020, with the exception of unstable angina and acute alcohol-related events, primary care contacts for all conditions studied had not recovered to pre-lockdown levels. In the general population, estimates of the absolute reduction in the number of primary care contacts up to July 2020, compared to what we would expect from previous years varied from fewer than 10 contacts per million for some cardiovascular outcomes, to 12,800 per million for depression and 6,600 for anxiety. In people with COPD, we estimated there were 43,900 per million fewer contacts for COPD exacerbations up to July 2020 than what we would expect from previous years.\n\nImplicatins of all the available evidenceWhile our results may represent some genuine reduction in disease frequency (e.g. the restriction measures may have improved diabetic glycaemic control due to more regular daily routines at home), it is more likely the reduced primary care conatcts we saw represent a substantial burden of unmet need (particularly for mental health conditions) that may be reflected in subsequent increased mortality and morbidity. Health service providers should take steps to prepare for increased demand in the coming months and years due to the short and longterm ramifications of reduced access to care for severe acute physical and mental health conditions. Maintaining access to primary care is key to future public health planning in relation to the pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Multiple studies have shown loss of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies over time after infection, raising concern that humoral immunity against the virus is not durable. If immunity wanes quickly, millions of people may be at risk for reinfection after recovery from COVID-19. However, memory B cells (MBC) could provide durable humoral immunity even if serum neutralizing antibody titers decline. We performed multi-dimensional flow cytometric analysis of S protein receptor binding domain (S-RBD)-specific MBC in cohorts of ambulatory COVID-19 patients with mild disease, and hospitalized patients with moderate to severe disease, at a median of 54 (39-104) days after onset of symptoms. We detected S-RBD-specific class-switched MBC in 13 out of 14 participants, including 4 of the 5 participants with lowest plasma levels of anti-S-RBD IgG and neutralizing antibodies. Resting MBC (rMBC) made up the largest proportion of S-RBD-specific class-switched MBC in both cohorts. FCRL5, a marker of functional memory when expressed on rMBC, was dramatically upregulated on S-RBD-specific rMBC. These data indicate that most SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals develop S-RBD-specific, class-switched MBC that phenotypically resemble germinal center-derived B cells induced by effective vaccination against other pathogens, providing evidence for durable B cell-mediated immunity against SARS-CoV-2 after recovery from mild or severe COVID-19 disease.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=125 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/20220996v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@89a49borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@95cac0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@320bc1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a1da2a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Herein we provide a living summary of the data generated during the COVID Moonshot project focused on the development of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitors. Our approach uniquely combines crowdsourced medicinal chemistry insights with high throughput crystallography, exascale computational chemistry infrastructure for simulations, and machine learning in triaging designs and predicting synthetic routes. This manuscript describes our methodologies leading to both covalent and non-covalent inhibitors displaying protease IC50 values under 150 nM and viral inhibition under 5 uM in multiple different viral replication assays. Furthermore, we provide over 200 crystal structures of fragment-like and lead-like molecules in complex with the main protease. Over 1000 synthesized and ordered compounds are also reported with the corresponding activity in Mpro enzymatic assays using two different experimental setups. The data referenced in this document will be continually updated to reflect the current experimental progress of the COVID Moonshot project, and serves as a citable reference for ensuing publications. All of the generated data is open to other researchers who may find it of use.",

    "abstract": "Antibody engineering technologies face increasing demands for speed, reliability and scale. We developed CeVICA, a cell-free antibody engineering platform that integrates a novel generation method and design for camelid heavy-chain antibody VHH domain-based synthetic libraries, optimized in vitro selection based on ribosome display and a computational pipeline for binder prediction based on CDR-directed clustering. We applied CeVICA to engineer antibodies against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and identified >800 predicted binder families. Among 14 experimentally-tested binders, 6 showed inhibition of pseudotyped virus infection. Antibody affinity maturation further increased binding affinity and potency of inhibition. Additionally, the unique capability of CeVICA for efficient and comprehensive binder prediction allowed retrospective validation of the fitness of our synthetic VHH library design and revealed direction for future refinement. CeVICA offers an integrated solution to rapid generation of divergent synthetic antibodies with tunable affinities in vitro and may serve as the basis for automated and highly parallel antibody generation.",

Immunizations using three different doses of PRAK-03202 induces antigen specific (Spike, envelope and membrane proteins) humoral response and neutralizing potential. PBMCs from convalescent patients, when exposed to PRAK-03202, showed lymphocyte proliferation and elevated IFN-{gamma} levels suggestive of conservation of epitopes and induction of T helper 1 (Th1)-biased cellular immune responses. These data support the clinical development and testing of PRAK-03202 for use in humans.",

    "abstract": "Seasonal coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1) are endemic to the human population, regularly infecting and reinfecting humans while typically causing asymptomatic to mild respiratory infections. It is not known to what extent reinfection by these viruses is due to waning immune memory or antigenic drift of the viruses. Here, we address the influence of antigenic drift on immune evasion of seasonal coronaviruses. We provide evidence that at least two of these viruses, OC43 and 229E, are undergoing adaptive evolution in regions of the viral spike protein that are exposed to human humoral immunity. This suggests that reinfection may be due, in part, to positively-selected genetic changes in these viruses that enable them to escape recognition by the immune system. It is possible that, as with seasonal influenza, these adaptive changes in antigenic regions of the virus would necessitate continual reformulation of a vaccine made against them.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Covid-19 pandemic has caused generous and well-developed healthcare systems to collapse. This paper quantifies how much system congestion may have increased mortality rates, using distance to the ICU as a proxy for access to emergency care.\n\nMethodsWe match daily death registry data for almost 1,500 municipalities in Lombardy, Italy, to data on geographical location of all ICU beds in the region. We then analyze how system congestion increases mortality in municipalities that are far from the ICU through a differences-in-differences regression model.\n\nFindingsWe find that Covid-19 mortality is up to 60% higher in the average municipality - which is 15 minutes driving away from the closest ICU - than in a municipality with an ICU in town. This difference is larger in areas and in days characterized by an abnormal number of calls to the emergency line.\n\nInterpretationWe interpret these results as suggesting that a sudden surge of critical patients may have congested the healthcare system, forcing emergency medical services to prioritize patients in the most proximate communities in order to maximize the number of lives saved. Through some back-of-the-envelope calculations, we estimate that Lombardys death toll from the first Covid-19 outbreak could have been 25% lower had all municipalities had ready access to the ICU. Drawing a lesson from Lombardys tale, governments should strengthen the emergency care response and palliate geographical inequalities to ensure that everyone in need can receive critical care on time during new outbreaks.\n\nFundingNo funding.",

    "abstract": "PurposeDetermining the triggering factor of the sudden surge of the daily new COVID-19 cases arising in most European countries during 2020 Autumn.\n\nMethodsThe dates of the surge were determined using a fitting of the two last months reported daily new cases in 18 European countries of latitude ranging from 39{degrees} to 62{degrees}.\n\nResultsThe study proves no correlation between the country surge date and its 2 weeks preceding temperature or humidity, but shows an impressive linear correlation with its latitude. The country surge date corresponds to the time when its sun UV daily dose drops below {approx} 34% of that of 0{degrees} latitude. Introducing reported seasonal blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration variation into reported link between acute respiratory track infection risk with 25(OH)D concentration quantitatively explains the surge dynamics.\n\nConclusionsSeveral studies already substantiated a 25(OH)D concentration impact on COVID-19 severity. However by comparing different patients populations, discriminate whether low 25(OH)D concentration is a real factor of covid-19 severity or only a marker of another weakness being the primary severity factor can be challenging. The date of the surge is an intrapopulation observation and has the benefit to be only triggered by a parameter globally affecting the population, i.e. the sun UV daily dose decreases. The results support that low 25(OH)D concentration is thus well a contributing factor of COVID-19 severity, which joined with the previous studies makes a convincing bundle of evidence",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic and governmental lockdown measures disproportionally impacts older adults. This study presents the results from a psychiatric helpline for older adults in Mannheim, Germany, during the lockdown, set up to provide information and psychosocial support measures. We aim to elucidate the needs of older adults, their reported changes and the psychological impact during the initial stages of the health crisis.\n\nMethods55 older adults called the psychiatric helpline between April and June 2020. Information on demographics, previous diagnosis of psychiatric and somatic diseases as well as changes in daily life due to the pandemic was collected anonymously. Current mental health status was assessed using the depression HAMD-7 and the anxiety HAM-A scales.\n\nResultsMost callers were women, older adults (M = 74.69 years), single and retired. 69% of callers reported new or an increase in psychiatric symptoms, with anxiety and depressive symptoms being the most common ones. Age was significantly negatively correlated to higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. Individuals with a previous diagnosis of a psychiatric disease reported significantly higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than those without a diagnosis.\n\nConclusionIn older adults, the perceived psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis appears to ameliorate with age. Individuals with a history of psychiatric disease are most vulnerable to negative mental health outcomes. Rapid response in the form of a geriatric helpline are useful initiatives to support the needs and the psychological well-being of older adults during a health crisis.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe management of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 should rely on early recognition of the risk for progression to severe respiratory failure (SRF) and its prevention. We investigated if early suPAR (soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor)-guided anakinra treatment could prevent COVID-19-assocated SRF.\n\nMethodsIn this open-label prospective trial, 130 patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia SARS-CoV-2 and suPAR levels [&ge;]6 g/l were assigned to subcutaneous anakinra 100mg once daily for 10 days. The primary outcome was the incidence of SRF at day 14. Secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality, changes in sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, of cytokine-stimulation pattern and of circulating inflammatory mediators. Equal number of propensity score-matched comparators for comorbidities, severity on admission and standard-of care (SOC) were studied.\n\nResultsThe incidence of SRF was 22.3% (95% CI, 16.0-30.2%) among anakinra-treated patients and 59.2% (95% CI, 50.6-67.3%; P: 4.6 x 10-8) among SOC comparators (hazard ratio, 0.30; 95%CI, 0.20-0.46). 30-day mortality was 11.5% (95% CI, 7.1-18.2%) and 22.3% (95% CI, 16.0-30.2%) respectively (hazard ratio 0.49; 95% CI 0.25-0.97%; P: 0.041). Anakinra treatment was associated with decrease in SOFA score and in circulating interleukin (IL)-6, sCD163 and sIL2-R; the serum IL-10/IL-6 ratio on day 7 was inversely associated with the change in SOFA score. Duration of stay at the intensive care unit and at hospital was shortened compared to the SOC group; the cost of hospitalization was decreased.\n\nConclusionsEarly suPAR-guided anakinra treatment is associated with decrease of the risk for SRF and restoration of the pro- /anti-inflammatory balance.\n\nTrial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04357366",

    "abstract": "While SARS-CoV-2 infection has pleiotropic and systemic effects in some patients, many others experience milder symptoms. We sought a holistic understanding of the severe/mild distinction in COVID-19 pathology, and its origins. We performed a whole-blood preserving single-cell analysis protocol to integrate contributions from all major cell types including neutrophils, monocytes, platelets, lymphocytes and the contents of serum. Patients with mild COVID-19 disease display a coordinated pattern of interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression across every cell population and these cells are systemically absent in patients with severe disease. Severe COVID-19 patients also paradoxically produce very high anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and have lower viral load as compared to mild disease. Examination of the serum from severe patients demonstrates that they uniquely produce antibodies with multiple patterns of specificity against interferon-stimulated cells and that those antibodies functionally block the production of the mild disease-associated ISG-expressing cells. Overzealous and auto-directed antibody responses pit the immune system against itself in many COVID-19 patients and this defines targets for immunotherapies to allow immune systems to provide viral defense.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryIn severe COVID-19 patients, the immune system fails to generate cells that define mild disease; antibodies in their serum actively prevents the successful production of those cells.",

    "abstract": "We have previously reported that the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody, STI-2020, potently inhibits cytopathic effects of infection by genetically diverse clinical SARS-CoV-2 pandemic isolates in vitro, and has demonstrated efficacy in a hamster model of COVID-19 when administered by the intravenous route immediately following infection. We now have extended our in vivo studies of STI-2020 to include disease treatment efficacy, profiling of biodistribution of STI-2020 in mice when antibody is delivered intranasally (IN) or intravenously (IV), as well as pharmacokinetics in mice following IN antibody administration. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters were treated with STI-2020 using these routes, and treatment effects on severity and duration of COVID-19-like disease in this model were evaluated. In SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters, treatment with STI-2020 12 hours post-infection using the IN route led to a decrease in severity of clinical disease signs and a more robust recovery during 9 days of infection as compared to animals treated with an isotype control antibody. Treatment via the IV route using the same dose and timing regimen resulted in a decrease in the average number of consecutive days that infected animals experienced weight loss, shortening the duration of disease and allowing recovery to begin more rapidly in STI-2020 treated animals. Following IN administration in mice, STI-2020 was detected within 10 minutes in both lung tissue and lung lavage. The half-life of STI-2020 in lung tissue is approximately 25 hours. We are currently investigating the minimum effective dose of IN-delivered STI-2020 in the hamster model as well as establishing the relative benefit of delivering neutralizing antibodies by both IV and IN routes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCurrent transmission rates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are still increasing and many countries are facing second waves of infections. Rapid SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is often unavailable but could support public health organizations and hospitals in monitoring and determining transmission links. Here we report the use of reverse complement polymerase chain reaction (RC-PCR), a novel technology for WGS of SARS-CoV-2 enabling library preparation in a single PCR saving time, resources and enables high throughput screening. Additionally, we show SARS-CoV-2 diversity and possible transmission within the Radboud university medical center (Radboudumc) during September 2020 using RC-PCR WGS.\n\nMethodsA total of 173 samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March and September 2020 were selected for whole-genome sequencing. Ct values of the samples ranged from 16 to 42. They were collected from 83 healthcare workers and three patients at the Radboudumc, in addition to 64 people living in the area around the hospital and tested by the local health services. For validation purposes, nineteen of the included samples were previously sequenced using Oxford Nanopore Technologies and compared to RC-PCR WGS results. The applicability of RC-PCR WGS in outbreak analysis for public health service and hospitals was tested on six suspected clusters containing samples of healthcare workers and patients with an epidemiological link.\n\nFindingsRC-PCR resulted in sequencing data for 146 samples. It showed a genome coverage of up to 98,2% for samples with a maximum Ct value of 32. Comparison to Oxford Nanopore technologies gives a near-perfect agreement on 95% of the samples (18 out of 19). Three out of six clusters with a suspected epidemiological link were fully confirmed, in the others, four healthcare workers were not associated. In the public health service samples, a previously unknown chain of transmission was confirmed.\n\nSignificance statementSAR-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing using RC-PCR is a reliable technique and applicable for use in outbreak analysis and surveillance. Its ease of use, high-trough screening capacity and wide applicability makes it a valuable addition or replacement during this ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.\n\nFundingNone\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSAt present whole genome sequencing techniques for SARS-CoV-2 have a large turnover time and are not widely available. Only a few laboratories are currently able to perform large scale SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. This restricts the use of sequencing to aid hospital and community infection prevention.\n\nAdded value of this studyHere we present clinical and technical data on a novel Whole Genome Sequencing technology, implementing reverse-complement PCR. It is able to obtain high genome coverage of SARS-CoV-2 and confirm and exclude epidemiological links in 173 healthcare workers and patients. The RC-PCR technology simplifies the workflow thereby reducing hands on time. It combines targeted PCR and sequence library construction in a single PCR, which normally takes several steps. Additionally, this technology can be used in concordance with the widely available range of Illumina sequencers.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceRC-PCR whole genome sequencing technology enables rapid and targeted surveillance and response to an ongoing outbreak that has great impact on public health and society. Increased use of sequencing technologies in local laboratories can help prevent increase of SARS-CoV-2 spreading by better understanding modes of transmission.",

    "abstract": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor has been identified as the key adhesion molecule for the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. However, there is no evidence that human genetic variation in ACE2 is singularly responsible for COVID-19 susceptibility. Therefore, we performed a multi-level characterization of genes that interact with ACE2 (ACE2-gene network) for their over-represented biological properties in the context of COVID-19.\n\nThe phenome-wide association of 51 genes including ACE2 with 4,756 traits categorized into 26 phenotype categories, showed enrichment of immunological, respiratory, environmental, skeletal, dermatological, and metabolic domains (p<4e-4). Transcriptomic regulation of ACE2-gene network was enriched for tissue-specificity in kidney, small intestine, and colon (p<4.7e-4). Leveraging the drug-gene interaction database we identified 47 drugs, including dexamethasone and spironolactone, among others.\n\nConsidering genetic variants within {+/-} 10 kb of ACE2-network genes we characterized functional consequences (among others) using miRNA binding-site targets. MiRNAs affected by ACE2-network variants revealed statistical over-representation of inflammation, aging, diabetes, and heart conditions. With respect to variants mapped to the ACE2-network, we observed COVID-19 related associations in RORA, SLC12A6 and SLC6A19 genes.\n\nOverall, functional characterization of ACE2-gene network highlights several potential mechanisms in COVID-19 susceptibility.

    "abstract": "Following its emergence in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic resulting in unprecedented efforts to reduce transmission and develop therapies and vaccines (WHO Emergency Committee, 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). Rapidly generated viral genome sequences have allowed the spread of the virus to be tracked via phylogenetic analysis (Hadfield et al., 2018; Pybus et al., 2020; Worobey et al., 2020). While the virus spread globally in early 2020 before borders closed, intercontinental travel has since been greatly reduced, allowing continent-specific variants to emerge. However, within Europe travel resumed in the summer of 2020, and the impact of this travel on the epidemic is not well understood. Here we report on a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, 20A.EU1, that emerged in Spain in early summer, and subsequently spread to multiple locations in Europe, accounting for the majority of sequences by autumn. We find no evidence of increased transmissibility of this variant, but instead demonstrate how rising incidence in Spain, resumption of travel across Europe, and lack of effective screening and containment may explain the variants success. Despite travel restrictions and quarantine requirements, we estimate 20A.EU1 was introduced hundreds of times to countries across Europe by summertime travellers, likely undermining local efforts to keep SARS-CoV-2 cases low. Our results demonstrate how genomic surveillance is critical to understanding how travel can impact SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and thus for informing future containment strategies as travel resumes.\n\nCAVEATSO_LI20A.EU1 most probably rose in frequency in multiple countries due to travel and difference in SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. There is no evidence that it spreads faster.\nC_LIO_LIThere are currently no data to evaluate whether this variant affects the severity of the disease.\nC_LIO_LIWhile dominant in some countries, 20A.EU1 has not taken over everywhere and diverse variants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to circulate across Europe. 20A.EU1 is not the cause of the European  second wave.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "We developed a simple and user-friendly simulator called MD Corona that is based on a multiagent model and describes the transmission dynamics of coronavirus for a given location considering three setting parameters: population density, social-isolation rate, and effective transmission probability. The latter is represented by the Coronavirus Protection Index (CPI) - a measurement of a given territorys vulnerability to the coronavirus that includes characteristics of the health system and socioeconomic development as well as infrastructure. The dynamic model also relies on other real epidemiological parameters. The model is calibrated by using immunity surveys and provides accurate predictions and indications of the different spread dynamic mechanisms. Our simulation studies clearly demonstrate the existence of multiple epidemic curves in the same city due to different vulnerabilities to the virus across regions. And it elucidates the phenomenon of the epidemic slowing despite a reduction in social-distancing policies, understood as a consequence of \"local protection bubbles.\" The simulator can be used for scientific outreach purposes, bringing science closer to the general public in order to raise awareness and increase engagement about the effectiveness of social distancing in reducing the transmissibility of the virus, but also to support effective actions to mitigate the spread of the virus.",

    "abstract": "ImportanceImportance: The interplay between COVID-19 pandemic and asthma in children is still unclear.\n\nObjectiveWe evaluated the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on childhood asthma outcomes.\n\nDesignThe PeARL multinational cohort included children with asthma and non-asthmatic controls recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic and compared current disease activity with data available from the previous year.\n\nSettingPediatric outpatient clinics.\n\nParticipantsThe study included 1,054 children with asthma and 505 non-asthmatic controls, aged between 4-18 years, from 25 pediatric departments, from 15 countries globally.\n\nExposuresCOVID-19 pandemic first wave, starting from the date of the first fatality in the respective country.\n\nMain outcomes and measuresWe assessed the pandemics impact on the frequency of respiratory infections, emergency presentations and hospital admissions in asthmatic versus non-asthmatic participants, controlling for confounding factors including the pandemics duration and the frequency of such acute events during 2019. Using paired analyses, we evaluated the impact of the pandemic on the annualized frequency of asthma attacks and the previously mentioned acute events, asthma control, and pulmonary function in children with asthma, compared to their baseline disease activity, during the preceding year.\n\nResultsDuring the pandemic, children with asthma experienced fewer upper respiratory tract infections, episodes of pyrexia, emergency visits, hospital admissions, asthma attacks and hospitalizations due to asthma, in comparison to the preceding year. Sixty-six percent of asthmatic children had improved asthma control while in 33% the improvement exceeded the minimally clinically important difference. Pre-bronchodilatation FEV1 and peak expiratory flow rate were also improved during the pandemic.\n\nWhen compared to non-asthmatic controls, children with asthma were not found to be at increased risk of LRTIs, episodes of pyrexia, emergency visits or hospitalizations during the pandemic. However, an increased risk of URTIs emerged.\n\nConclusions and relevanceChildhood asthma outcomes, including control, were improved during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, probably because of reduced exposure to asthma triggers and increased treatment adherence. The decreased frequency of acute episodes does not support the notion that childhood asthma may be a risk factor for COVID-19. Furthermore, the potential for improving childhood asthma outcomes through environmental control becomes apparent.\n\nKey PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat was the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on childhood asthma outcomes?\n\nFindingsDuring the first wave of the pandemic, children with asthma have experienced improved outcomes, as evidenced by fewer asthma attachks, hospitalizations, improved scores in validated asthma control measures and improved pulmonary function.\n\nMeaningThis is the first study to show a positive impact of COVID-19 pandemic on childhood asthma activity. This is probably the result of reduced exposure to asthma triggers and increased treatment adherence. The decreased frequency of acute episodes does not support the hypothesis that childhood asthma may be a risk factor for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted planned annual antibiotic mass drug administration (MDA) activities which have formed the cornerstone of the largely successful global efforts to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem.\n\nMethodsUsing a mathematical model we investigate the impact of interruption to MDA in trachoma-endemic settings. We evaluate potential measures to mitigate this impact and consider alternative strategies for accelerating progress in those areas where the trachoma elimination targets may not be achievable otherwise.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate that for districts which were hyperendemic at baseline, or where the trachoma elimination thresholds have not already been achieved after 3 rounds of MDA, the interruption to planned MDA could lead to a delay greater than the duration of interruption. We also show that an additional round of MDA in the year following MDA resumption could effectively mitigate this delay. For districts where probability of elimination under annual MDA was already very low, we demonstrate that more intensive MDA schedules are needed to achieve agreed targets.\n\nConclusionThrough appropriate use of additional MDA, the impact of COVID-19 in terms of delay to reaching trachoma elimination targets can be effectively mitigated. Additionally, more frequent MDA may accelerate progress towards 2030 goals.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA significant decrease in the number of cases of emergency medical care during the first phase of the Corona pandemic has been reported from various regions of the world. Due to the lack of or delayed use of medical assistance, particularly in the case of time-critical clinical pictures (myocardial infarction, stroke), a corona collateral damage syndrome is postulated regarding possible health consequences. The present study investigates changes in the use of preclinical and clinical emergency care and effects on overall mortality in a rural area.\n\nMethodsThe number of patients in the emergency department at the Klinikum Hochrhein and the ambulance service were retrospectively aggregated and analyzed regarding the total number and selected tracer diagnoses and alarm keywords. The investigation period was the 9th to 22nd calendar week 2020 compared to the identical period of the previous year. In addition, the death rates in the district were collected directly from the registries and related to the number of patients in emergency care.\n\nResultsOverall, the number of patients in clinical and preclinical emergency care declined significantly during the investigation period. This concerned in particular emergency inpatient treatment of patients with exacerbations or complications of severe chronic diseases. At the same time, excess mortality occurred in April 2020, which was still highly significant even after excluding deaths on or with COVID-19.\n\nDiscussionOnly about 55 % of the excess mortality in April 2020 can be attributed to COVID-19 and is associated with the decline in inpatient emergency treatment, especially of chronically ill patients. Since a drift of patients with the use of other service providers is unlikely, we assume that fears of infection in overburdened hospitals, one-sided public communication and reporting, and the extent of contact restrictions have contributed significantly to the decline in case numbers and to excess mortality (collateral damage).\n\nConclusionFor similar situations in the future, it is strongly recommended to make crisis communication and media coverage more balanced so as not to prevent people with acute health problems from receiving medical assistance. Contact restrictions should be critically reviewed and limited to the objectively necessary minimum.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesTo determine the extent and nature of changes in utilisation of healthcare services during COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDesignSystematic review\n\nEligibilityEligible studies compared utilisation of services during COVID-19 pandemic to at least one comparable period in prior years. Services included visits, admissions, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Studies were excluded if from single-centres or studied only COVID-19 patients.\n\nData sourcesPubMed, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and pre-prints were searched, without language restrictions, until August 10, using detailed searches with key concepts including COVID-19, health services and impact.\n\nData analysisRisk of bias was assessed by adapting ROBINS-I and Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care tool. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics, graphical figures, and narrative synthesis.\n\nOutcome measuresPrimary outcome was change in service utilisation between pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. Secondary outcome was the change in proportions of users of healthcare services with milder or more severe illness (e.g. triage scores).\n\nResults3097 unique references were identified, and 81 studies across 20 countries included, reporting on >11 million services pre-pandemic and 6.9 million during pandemic. For the primary outcome, there were 143 estimates of changes, with a median 37% reduction in services overall (interquartile range -51% to -20%), comprising median reductions for visits of 42%(-53% to -32%), admissions, 28%(-40% to -17%), diagnostics, 31%(-53% to -24%), and for therapeutics, 30%(-57% to -19%). Among 35 studies reporting secondary outcomes, there were 60 estimates, with 27(45%) reporting larger reductions in utilisation among people with a milder spectrum of illness, and 33 (55%) reporting no change.\n\nConclusionsHealthcare utilisation decreased by about a third during the pandemic, with considerable variation, and with greater reductions among people with less severe illness. While addressing unmet need remains a priority, studies of health impacts of reductions may help health-systems prioritise higher-value care in the post-pandemic recovery.\n\nFunding, Study registrationNo funding was required. PROSPERO: CRD42020203729\n\nStrengths and limitations of this study- The review is the first broad synthesis of global studies of pandemic related changes in utilisation across all categories of healthcare services.\n- The review provides novel findings informing design of future studies of pandemic-related changes in utilisation and its impacts.\n- Limitations include the possibility of publication bias and the potential of our eligibility criteria to exclude important data sources such as studies in single-centres and unpublished datasets from health systems.\n- Heterogenous designs and settings precluding meta-analysis.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe recovery of other respiratory viruses in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported, either at the time of a SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis (co-infection) or subsequently (superinfection). However, data on the prevalence, microbiology and outcomes of co-infection and super infection are limited. The purpose of this study was to examine occurrence of respiratory co-infections and superinfections and their outcomes among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nPatients and MethodsWe searched literature databases for studies published from October 1, 2019, through June 11, 2020. We included studies that reported clinical features and outcomes of co-infection or super-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. We followed PRISMA guidelines and we registered the protocol with PROSPERO as: CRD42020189763.\n\nResultsOf 1310 articles screened, 48 were included in the random effects meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of co-infection was 12% (95% confidence interval (CI): 6%-18%, n=29, I2=98%) and that of super-infection was 14% (95% CI: 9%-21%, n=18, I2=97%). Pooled prevalence of pathogen type stratified by co- or super-infection: viral co-infections, 4% (95% CI: 2%-7%); viral super-infections, 2% (95% CI: 0%-7%); bacterial co-infections, 4% (95% CI: 1%-8%); bacterial super-infections, 6% (95% CI: 2%-11%); fungal co-infections, 4% (95% CI: 1%-8%); and fungal super-infections, 4% (95% CI: 0%-11%). Compared to those with co-infections, patients with super-infections had a higher prevalence of mechanical ventilation [21% (95% CI: 13%-31%) vs. 7% (95% CI: 2%-15%)] and greater average length of hospital stay [mean=12.5 days, standard deviation (SD) =5.3 vs. mean=10.2 days, SD= 6.7].\n\nConclusionsOur study showed that as many as 14% of patients with COVID-19 have super-infections and 12% have co-infections. Poor outcomes were associated with super-infections. Our findings have implications for diagnostic testing and therapeutics, particularly in the upcoming respiratory virus season in the Northern Hemisphere.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that has rapidly expanded to become a pandemic, resulting in millions of deaths worldwide. The cytokine storm is caused by the release of inflammatory agents and results in a physiologic disruption. Tocilizumab is an IL-6 receptor antagonist with the ability to suppress the cytokine storm in critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nMethodsThis was a multi-center study of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, admitted between 3/13/20 and 4/16/20, requiring mechanical ventilation. Parameters that were evaluated included age, sex, race, usage of steroids, inflammatory markers, and comorbidities. Early dosing was defined as a tocilizumab dose administered prior to or within one (1) day of intubation. Late dosing was defined as a dose administered greater than one (1) day after intubation. A control group that was treated only with standard of care, and without tocilizumab, was utilized for comparison (untreated).\n\nFindingsWe studied 118 patients who required mechanical ventilation. Eighty-one (81) received tocilizumab, compared to 37 who were untreated. Early tocilizumab therapy was associated with a statistically significant decrease in mortality as compared to patients who were untreated (p=0.003). Dosing tocilizumab late was associated with an increased mortality compared to the untreated group (p=0.006).\n\nInterpretationEarly tocilizumab administration was associated with decreased mortality in critically ill SARS-Co-V-2 patients, but a potential detriment was suggested by dosing later in a patients course.\n\nFundingThis work did not receive outside funding or sponsorship.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic seems to have a different picture in Africa; the first case was identified in the continent after it has already caused a significant loss to the rest of the world and the reported number of cases and mortality rate has been low. Understanding the characteristics and outcome of the pandemicin the African setup is therefore crucial.\n\nAimTo assess the characteristics and outcome of COVID-19 patients and to identify determinants of the disease outcome among patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia.\n\nMethodsA prospective cohort study was conducted among 1345 consecutively admitted RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients from July to September, 2020. Frequency tables, KM plots, median survival times and Log-rank test were used to describe the data and compare survival distribution between groups. Cox proportional hazard survival model was used to identify determinants of time to clinical improvement and the independent variables, where adjusted hazard ratio, P-value and 95% CI for adjusted hazard ratio were used for testing significance and interpretation of results. Binary logistic regression model was used to assess the presence of a statistically significant association between disease outcome and the independent variables, where adjusted odds ratio, P-value and 95% CI for adjusted odds ratio were used for testing significance and interpretation of results\n\nResultsAmong the study population, 71 (5.3%) died, 72 (5.4%) were transferred and the rest 1202 (89.4%) were clinically improved. The median time to clinical improvement was 14 days. On the multivariable Cox proportional hazard model; temperature (AHR= 1.135, 95% CI= 1.011, 1.274, p-value=0.032), COVID-19 severity (AHR= 0.660, 95% CI= 0.501, 0.869, p-value=0.003), and cough (AHR= 0.705, 95% CI= 0.519, 0.959, p-value=0.026) were found to be significant determinants of time to clinical improvement. On the binary logistic regression, the following factors were found to be significantly associated with disease outcome; SPO2 (AOR= 0.302, 95% CI= 0.193, 0.474, p-value=0.0001), shortness of breath (AOR= 0.354, 95% CI= 0.213, 0.590, p-value=0.0001) and diabetes mellitus (AOR= 0.549, 95% CI= 0.337, 0.894, p-value=0.016).\n\nConclusionsThe average duration of time to clinical improvement was 14 days and 89.4 % of the patients achieved clinical improvement. The mortality rate of the studied population is lower than reports from other countries including those in Africa. Having severe COVID-19 disease severity and presenting with cough were found to be associated with delayed clinical improvement of the disease. On the other hand, being hyperthermic is associated with shorter disease duration (faster time to clinical improvement). In addition, lower oxygen saturation and subjective complaint of shortness of breath and being diabetic were associated with unfavorable disease outcome. Therefore, patients with these factors should be followed cautiously for a better outcome.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAntibody testing can help define how protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is and how long this immunity lasts. Many antibody tests have been evaluated in hospitalised rather than community based COVID-19 cases. Virtus Respiratory Research Ltd (Virtus) has developed its own quantitative IgM and IgG SARS CoV-2 antibody assay. We report its validation and performance characteristics and compare its performance with the Abbott Architect and Roche Elecsys assays in community COVID cases.\n\nMethodsWe developed a quantitative antibody test to detect IgM and IgG to the SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein (the Virtus test) and validated this test in 107 \"true positive\" sera from 106 community-managed and 1 hospitalised COVID-19 cases and 208 \"true negative\" serum samples. We validated the Virtus test against a neutralising antibody test. We determined sensitivities of the Abbott test in the 107 true positive samples and the Roche test in a subset of 75 true positive samples.\n\nResultsThe Virtus quantitative test was positive in 93 of 107 (87%) community cases of COVID-19 and both IgM and IgG levels correlated strongly with neutralising antibody titres (r=0.75 for IgM, r=0.71 for IgG, P<0.0001 for both antibodies). The specificity of the Virtus test was 98.6% for low level antibody positives, 99.5% for moderate positives and 100% for high or very high positives. The Abbott test had a sensitivity of 68%. In the 75 sample subset, the Virtus test was positive in 91%, the Roche test in 69%.\n\nConclusionsThe Abbott and Roche tests had sensitives of 68% and 69% respectively in this community set of COVID-19 sera, while the Virtus test had sensitivities of 87% and 91% in the same sample sets. The strong positive correlation with virus neutralization suggests a positive Virtus quantitative antibody test is likely predictive of protective against recurrent COVID-19.\n\nFundingThe development of the Virtus test and sample testing with all antibody tests was funded by Virtus Respiratory Research Ltd. The research studies providing 111 of the 208 of the \"true negative\" samples was supported by MRC Grant numbers MR/M025330/1 and G1100238 and by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Imperial Biomedical Research Centre (BRC), SLJ is a NIHR Emeritus Senior Investigator and is funded in part by European Research Council Advanced Grant 788575 and the Asthma UK Clinical Chair (grant CH11SJ).

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 quickly spread in the worldwide population by contact with oral and respiratory secretions of infected individuals, imposing social restrictions to control the infection. Massive testing is essential to breaking the chain of COVID-19 transmission. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of at-home self-collected samples - saliva and combined nasal-oropharyngeal swabs (NOP) - for SARS-CoV-2 detection in a telemedicine platform for COVID-19 surveillance. We analyzed 201 patients who met the criteria of suspected COVID-19. NOP sampling were combined (nostrils and oropharynx) and saliva collected using a cotton pad device. Detection of SARS-COV-2 was performed by using the Altona RealStar(R) SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit 1.0. According to our data, there was an overall significant agreement ({kappa} coefficient value of 0.58) between the performances of saliva and NOP. Assuming that positive results in either sample represent true infections, 70 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 were identified, with 52/70 being positive in NOP and 55/70 in saliva. This corresponds to sensitivities of 74.2% (95% CI; 63.7% to 83.1%) for NOP and 78.6% (95% CI; 67.6% to 86.6%) for saliva. We also found a strong correlation ({beta}-coefficients < 1) between the cycle threshold values in saliva and NOP. Ageusia was the only symptom associated with patients SARS-CoV-2 positive only in NOP (p=0.028). In conclusion, our data show the feasibility of using at-home self-collected samples (especially saliva), as an adequate alternative for SARS-CoV-2 detection. This new approach of testing can be useful to develop strategies for COVID-19 surveillance and for guiding public health decisions.",

    "abstract": "Frailty has been linked to increased risk of COVID-19 mortality, but evidence is mainly limited to hospitalized older individuals and analyses in community samples are scarce. This study aims to assess and compare the predictive abilities of different frailty measures - the frailty phenotype (FP), frailty index (FI), and Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS), and comorbidity, measured using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), on COVID-19 mortality in a UK community sample of adults aged 52-86 years. We analyzed (i) the full sample of 428,754 UK Biobank participants and (ii) a subsample of 2,287 COVID-19 positive UK Biobank participants with data on COVID-19 outcomes between March 1 and September 21, 2020. COVID-19 positivity was confirmed by PCR, hospital records and/or death registers. Logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, smoking, ethnicity, and socioeconomic variables with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were used in the modelling. Overall, 391 individuals died of COVID-19. In the full sample, all frailty measures and the CCI were associated with COVID-19 mortality but only the HFRS and CCI improved the predictive ability of a model including age and sex, yielding AUCs>0.80. However, when restricting analyses to the COVID-19 positive subsample, which had an over-representation of frail individuals, similar improvement in AUCs was not observed in which only the CCI was significantly associated with COVID-19 mortality. Our results suggest that HFRS and CCI can be used in COVID-19 mortality risk stratification at the population level, but they show limited added value in COVID-19 positive individuals.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInformation on COVID-19 in representative community surveillance is limited, particularly regarding cycle threshold (Ct) values (a proxy for SARS-CoV-2 viral load) and symptoms.\n\nMethodsWe included all positive nose and throat swabs between 26 April-11 October 2020 from the UKs national COVID-19 Infection Survey, tested by RT-PCR for the N, S and ORF1ab genes. We investigated predictors of median Ct value using quantile regression.\n\nResults1892(0.22%) of 843,851 results were positive, 1362(72%), 185(10%) and 345(18%) for 3, 2 or 1 genes respectively. Ct for different genes were strongly correlated (rho=0.99) with overall median Ct 26.2 (IQR 19.7-31.1; range 10.3-37.6), corresponding to [~]2,500 dC/ml (IQR 80-240,000). Ct values were independently lower in those reporting symptoms, with more genes detected, and in first (vs. subsequent) positives per-participant, with no evidence of independent effects of sex, ethnicity, age, deprivation or other test characteristics (p>0.20). Whilst single-gene positives without reported symptoms almost invariably had Ct>30, triple-gene positives without reported symptoms had widely varying Ct. Incorporating pre-test probability and Ct values, 1547(82%) and 112(6%) positives had \"higher\" or \"lower\" supporting evidence for genuine infection. Ct values, symptomatic percentages and supporting evidence changed over time. With lower positivity in the summer, there were proportionally more \"lower\" evidence positives, and \"higher\" evidence positives had higher Ct values (p<0.0001), suggesting lower viral burden. Declines in mean/median Ct values were apparent throughout August and preceded increases in positivity rates.\n\nConclusionsCommunity SARS-CoV-2 infections show marked variation in viral load. Ct values could be a useful epidemiological early-warning indicator.\n\nSUMMARYCycle threshold (Ct) values in community SARS-CoV-2 infections from national surveillance vary markedly, including over time and by symptoms (1892 (0.22%) positive nose and throat swabs, 843,851 tested). Ct values could be a useful epidemiological early warning indicator.",

    "abstract": "The clinical and scientific communities rely on serology testing to analyze the degree of antibody-mediated immunity afforded to recovered patients from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neutralizing antibodies present in COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) remains a practical therapy to treat COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization. However, it remains unclear how long antibody levels persist in CCP donors after recovery. An accurate estimation of antibody kinetics in CCP donors provide an important observation to further define the extent of long-term immunity in recovered patient and simultaneously inform CCP collection processes in efforts to improve CCP dosing and therapeutic outcome. In this study, we analyzed 63 donors and measured antibody levels using two high throughput screening assays (HTSA) designed to detect antibodies targeting the spike protein (S1) and nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 and monitored antibody levels between 2-8 consecutive donations. We show that anti-S1 antibody levels, as measured using the Ortho Total Ig HTSA, increased over time in repeat CCP donors while anti-NP antibody levels, as measured using the Abbott IgG HTSA, were unchanged or decreased over time. When we normalized these data, we found that both the absolute levels of anti-S1 antibodies and the ratio between S1 and NP antibodies tends to increase over time. These data have important implications for the convalescent donation process, patient protection from future infection and characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 immune response.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have had a particularly high impact on the health and wellbeing of people with pre-existing mental disorders. This may include higher than expected mortality rates due to severe infections themselves, due to other comorbidities, or through increased suicide rates during lockdown. However, there has been very little published information to date on causes of death in mental health service users. Taking advantage of a large mental healthcare database linked to death registrations, we describe numbers of deaths within specific underlying-cause-of-death groups for the period from 1st March to 30th June in 2020 and compare these with the same four-month periods in 2015-2019. In past and current service users, there were 2561 deaths in March-June 2020, compared to an average of 1452 for the same months in 2015-19: an excess of 1109. The 708 deaths with COVID-19 as the underlying cause in 2020 accounted for 63.8% of that excess. The remaining excess was accounted for by unnatural/unexplained deaths and by deaths recorded as due to neurodegenerative conditions, with no excess in those attributed to cancer, circulatory disorders, digestive disorders, respiratory disorders, or other disease codes. Of 295 unexplained deaths in 2020 with missing data on cause, 162 (54.9%) were awaiting a formal death notice (i.e. the group that included deaths awaiting a coroners inquest) - an excess of 129 compared to the average of previous years, accounting for 11.6% of the excess in total deaths.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDecisions regarding the continued need for control measures to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 rely on accurate and up-to-date information about the number of people and risk factors for testing positive. Existing surveillance systems are not based on population samples and are generally not longitudinal in design.\n\nMethodsFrom 26 April to 19 September2020, 514,794 samples from 123,497 individuals were collected from individuals aged 2 years and over from a representative sample of private households from England. Participants completed a questionnaire and nose and throat swab were taken. The percentage of individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was estimated over time using dynamic multilevel regression and post-stratification, to account for potential residual non-representativeness. Potential changes in risk factors for testing positive over time were also evaluated using multilevel regression models.\n\nFindingsBetween 26 April and 19 September 2020, in total, results were available from 514,794 samples from 123,497 individuals, of which 489 were positive overall from 398 individuals. The percentage of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 changed substantially over time, with an initial decrease between end of April and June, followed by low levels during the summer, before marked increases end of August and September 2020. Having a patient-facing role and working outside your home were important risk factors for testing positive in the first period but not (yet) in the second period of increased positivity rates, and age (young adults) being an important driver of the second period of increased positivity rates. A substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms (53%-70%, dependent on calendar time).\n\nInterpretationImportant risk factors for testing positive varied substantially between the initial and second periods of higher positivity rates, and a substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be important for managing the epidemic moving forwards.\n\nFundingThis study is funded by the Department of Health and Social Care. KBP, ASW, EP and JVR are supported by the National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit (NIHR HPRU) in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance at the University of Oxford in partnership with Public Health England (PHE) (NIHR200915).

The views expressed are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the National Health Service, NIHR, Department of Health, or PHE.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSUnprecedented control measures, such as national lockdowns, have been widely implemented to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Decisions regarding the continued need for social distancing measures in the overall population, specific subgroups and geographic areas heavily rely on accurate and up-to-date information about the number of people and risk factors for testing positive. We searched PubMed and medRxiv and bioRxiv preprint servers up to 6 June 2020 for epidemiological studies using the terms \"SARS-CoV-2\" and \"prevalence\" or \"incidence\" without data or language restrictions. Most studies were small or had only information about current presence of the virus for a small subset of patients, or used data not representative of the community, such as hospital admissions, deaths or self-reported symptoms. Large population-based studies, such as the current study, are required to understand risk factors and the dynamics of the epidemic.\n\nAdded value of this studyThis is the first longitudinal community survey of SARS-CoV-2 infection at national and regional levels in the UK. With more than 500,000 swabs from more than 120,000 individuals this study provides robust evidence that the percentage of individuals from the general community in England testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 clearly declined between end of April and June 2020,, followed by consistently low levels during the summer, before marked increases end of August and September 2020. Risk factors for testing positive varied substantially between the initial and second periods of higher positivity rates, with having a patient-facing role and working outside your home being important risk factors in the first period but not (yet) in the second period, and age (young adults) being an important driver of the second period of increased positivity rates. Positive tests commonly occurred without symptoms being reported.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceThe observed decline in the percentage of individuals testing positive adds to the increasing body of empirical evidence and theoretical models that suggest that the lockdown imposed on 23 March 2020 in England was associated, at least temporarily, with a decrease in infections. Important risk factors for testing positive varied substantially between the initial and second periods of higher positivity rates, and a substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be important for managing the epidemic moving forwards.",

    "abstract": "The UK enacted an intensive, nationwide lockdown on March 23 2020 to mitigate transmission of COVID-19. As restrictions began to ease, resurgence in transmission has been targeted by geographically-limited interventions of various stringencies. Determining the optimal spatial scale for local interventions is critical to ensure interventions reach the most at risk areas without unnecessarily restricting areas at low risk of resurgence. Here we use detailed human mobility data from Facebook to determine the spatially-explicit network community structure of the UK before and during the lockdown period, and how that has changed in response to the easing of restrictions and to locally-targeted interventions. We found that the mobility network became more sparse and the number of mobility communities decreased under the national lockdown. During this period, there was no evidence of re-routing in the network. Communities in which locally-targeted interventions have happened following resurgence did not show reorganization but did show small decreases in measurable mobility effects in the Facebook dataset. We propose that geographic communities detected in Facebook or other mobility data be part of decision making for determining the spatial extent or boundaries of interventions in the UK. These data are available in near real-time, and allow quantification of changes in the distribution of the population across the UK, as well as peoples travel patterns to give data-driven metrics for geographically-targeted interventions.\n\nSignificance StatementLarge-scale intensive interventions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have affected human movement patterns. Mobility data show spatially-explicit network structure, but it is not clear if that structure changed in response to national or locally-targeted interventions. We used daily Facebook for Good mobility data to quantify changes in the travel network in the UK during the national lockdown, and in response to local interventions. The network community structure inherent in these networks can help quantify which areas are at risk of resurgence, or the extent of locally-targeted interventions aiming to suppress transmission. We showed that spatial mobility data available in real-time can give information on connectivity that can be used to optimise the scale of geographically-targeted interventions.",

Indeed when the disease had first appeared, in the accelerating stage the spread pattern was observed to have followed a highly nonlinear pattern that could be said to be approximately exponential or sub-exponential. As to why in the resurgence the growth has become hyper-exponential is another matter. But this has been happening in Europe and how long this would continue cannot be predicted. It may so happen that in the countries in which retardation has already been taking place, there may be resurgence of the disease. It was observed that in the World as a whole, retardation was on the threshold during the second half of September. But if the resurgence happens to follow the hyper-exponential growth pattern in different countries, there may be resurgence in the World as a whole.",

For control counties we used the median of the gathering dates.\n\nSettingThe United States\n\nPopulation8.4 million in the counties holding mass gatherings, and 324 Million in the rest of the counties in the United States.\n\nMain Outcome MeasureChange in COVID-19 incidence rate per 100,000 capita during the two weeks following mass gatherings.\n\nResultsIn the two weeks following the gatherings, the COVID-19 incidence increased significantly in 14 of 20 counties. The county with the highest incidence increase (3.8-fold) had the 2nd lowest incidence before the gathering. The county with the highest decrease (0.4-fold) had the 3rd highest incidence before the gathering. At the gathering date, the average incidence of counties with gatherings was lower than the rest of the United States, and after the gathering, it increased 1.5-fold, while the rest of the United States increased 1.02-fold.\n\nConclusionThese results suggest that even outdoor gatherings in areas with low COVID-19 incidence are followed by increased infections, and that further precautions should be taken at such gatherings.\n\nWhat is already known on the topicMass gatherings have been linked to COVID-19 infections, but it is less clear how much it happens outdoors, and in areas with low incidence.\n\nWhat this study addsCOVID-19 infections increased significantly in 14 of 20 counties that held mass gathering rallies in the United States, 19 of which were outdoors. The county with the highest incidence increase (3.8-fold) was outdoors and had a low incidence before the gathering. The average incidence of all 20 counties with gatherings was lower at the gathering day compared with the rest of the United State, and it increased 1.5-fold following the gatherings. Our findings suggest a need for precautions in mass gatherings, even when outdoors and in areas with a low incidence of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the utility of widespread molecular testing for surveillance and diagnostic detection of SARS-CoV-2. Reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) has enabled testing outside of the standard clinical laboratory PCR infrastructure, with simple and rapid tests supplementing the existing, standard methods. However, current LAMP tests have detected single targets and required separate reactions for controls or multiple targets. As flu season arrives in the Northern Hemisphere the ability to screen for multiple viral targets will be increasingly important, and the ability to include internal control assays in the RT-LAMP test allows for decreased resource use and increased throughput. Here we describe a multiplexing approach to RT-LAMP with four targets (SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A, Influenza B, and internal control human RNA) in a single reaction using real-time and endpoint fluorescence detection. This increase to the functionality of RT-LAMP will, we hope, enable even broader adoption of this power molecular testing approach to aid in the global fight against this continuing public health threat.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe prevalence and persistence of antibodies following a peak SARS-CoV-2 infection provides insights into its spread in the community, the likelihood of reinfection and potential for some level of population immunity.\n\nMethodsPrevalence of antibody positivity in England, UK (REACT2) with three cross-sectional surveys between late June and September 2020. 365104 adults used a self-administered lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test for IgG. A laboratory comparison of LFIA results to neutralization activity in panel of sera was performed.\n\nResultsThere were 17,576 positive tests over the three rounds. Antibody prevalence, adjusted for test characteristics and weighted to the adult population of England, declined from 6.0% [5.8, 6.1], to 4.8% [4.7, 5.0] and 4.4% [4.3, 4.5], a fall of 26.5% [-29.0, -23.8] over the three months of the study. There was a decline between rounds 1 and 3 in all age groups, with the highest prevalence of a positive result and smallest overall decline in positivity in the youngest age group (18-24 years: -14.9% [-21.6, -8.1]), and lowest prevalence and largest decline in the oldest group (75+ years: -39.0% [-50.8, -27.2]); there was no change in antibody positivity between rounds 1 and 3 in healthcare workers (+3.45% [-5.7, +12.7]).\n\nThe decline from rounds 1 to 3 was largest in those who did not report a history of COVID-19, (-64.0% [-75.6, -52.3]), compared to -22.3% ([-27.0, -17.7]) in those with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed on PCR.\n\nDiscussionThese findings provide evidence of variable waning in antibody positivity over time such that, at the start of the second wave of infection in England, only 4.4% of adults had detectable IgG antibodies using an LFIA. Antibody positivity was greater in those who reported a positive PCR and lower in older people and those with asymptomatic infection. These data suggest the possibility of decreasing population immunity and increasing risk of reinfection as detectable antibodies decline in the population.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has disproportionately affected older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions. Research has focused on short-term outcomes in hospital, and single organ involvement. Consequently, impact of long COVID (persistent symptoms three months post-infection) across multiple organs in low-risk individuals is yet to be assessed.\n\nMethodsAn ongoing prospective, longitudinal, two-centre, observational study was performed in individuals symptomatic after recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Symptoms and organ function (heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, spleen) were assessed by standardised questionnaires (EQ-5D-5L, Dyspnoea-12), blood investigations and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, defining single and multi-organ impairment by consensus definitions.\n\nFindingsBetween April and September 2020, 201 individuals (mean age 44 (SD 11.0) years, 70% female, 87% white, 31% healthcare workers) completed assessments following SARS-CoV-2 infection (median 140, IQR 105-160 days after initial symptoms). The prevalence of pre-existing conditions (obesity: 20%, hypertension: 6%; diabetes: 2%; heart disease: 4%) was low, and only 18% of individuals had been hospitalised with COVID-19. Fatigue (98%), muscle aches (88%), breathlessness (87%), and headaches (83%) were the most frequently reported symptoms. Ongoing cardiorespiratory (92%) and gastrointestinal (73%) symptoms were common, and 42% of individuals had ten or more symptoms.\n\nThere was evidence of mild organ impairment in heart (32%), lungs (33%), kidneys (12%), liver (10%), pancreas (17%), and spleen (6%). Single (66%) and multi-organ (25%) impairment was observed, and was significantly associated with risk of prior COVID-19 hospitalisation (p<0.05).\n\nInterpretationIn a young, low-risk population with ongoing symptoms, almost 70% of individuals have impairment in one or more organs four months after initial symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are implications not only for burden of long COVID but also public health approaches which have assumed low risk in young people with no comorbidities.\n\nFundingThis work was supported by the UKs National Consortium of Intelligent Medical Imaging through the Industry Strategy Challenge Fund, Innovate UK Grant 104688, and also through the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 719445.",

Here we report results from the fifth round of observations for swabs collected from the 18th September to 5th October 2020. This report updates and should be read alongside our round 5 interim report.\n\nMethodsRepresentative samples of the population aged 5 years and over in England with sample size ranging from 120,000 to 175,000 people at each round. Prevalence of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, estimation of reproduction number (R) and time trends between and within rounds using exponential growth or decay models.\n\nResults175,000 volunteers tested across England between 18th September and 5th October. Findings show a national prevalence of 0.60% (95% confidence interval 0.55%, 0.71%) and doubling of the virus every 29 (17, 84) days in England corresponding to an estimated national R of 1.16 (1.05, 1.27). These results correspond to 1 in 170 people currently swab-positive for the virus and approximately 45,000 new infections each day. At regional level, the highest prevalence is in the North West, Yorkshire and The Humber and the North East with strongest regional growth in North West, Yorkshire and The Humber and West Midlands.\n\nConclusionRapid growth has led to high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in England, with highest rates in the North of England. Prevalence has increased in all age groups, including those at highest risk. Improved compliance with existing policy and, as necessary, additional interventions are required to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community and limit the numbers of hospital admissions and deaths from COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic in the UK has been characterised by periods of exponential growth and decline, as different non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are brought into play. During the early uncontrolled phase of the outbreak (early March 2020) there was a period of prolonged exponential growth with epidemiological observations such as hospitalisation doubling every 3-4 days (growth rate r {approx} 0.2). The enforcement of strict lockdown measures led to a noticeable decline in all epidemic quantities (r {approx} -0.06) that slowed during the summer as control measures were relaxed (r {approx} -0.02). Since August, infections, hospitalisations and deaths have been rising (precise estimation of the current growth rate is difficult due to extreme regional heterogeneity and temporal lags between the different epidemiological observations) and various NPIs have been applied locally throughout the UK in response.\n\nControlling any rise in infection is a compromise between public health and societal costs, with more stringent NPIs reducing cases but damaging the economy and restricting freedoms. Currently, NPI imposition is made in response to the epidemiological state, are of indefinite length and are often imposed at short notice, greatly increasing the negative impact. An alternative approach is to consider planned, limited duration periods of strict NPIs aiming to purposefully reduce prevalence before such emergency NPIs are required. These \"precautionary breaks\" may offer a means of keeping control of the epidemic, while their fixed duration and the forewarning may limit their society impact. Here, using simple analysis and age-structured models matched to the unfolding UK epidemic, we investigate the action of precautionary breaks. In particular we consider their impact on the prevalence of infection, as well as the total number of predicted hospitalisations and deaths. We find that precautionary breaks provide the biggest gains when the growth rate is low, but offer a much needed brake on increasing infection when the growth rate is higher, potentially allowing other measures (such as contact tracing) to regain control.",

    "abstract": "This study applied causal criteria in directed acyclic graphs for handling covariates in associations for prognosis of severe COVID-19 (Corona virus disease 19) cases. To identify nonspecific blood tests and risk factors as predictors of hospitalization due to COVID-19, one has to exclude noisy predictors by comparing the concordance statistics (AUC) for positive and negative cases of SARS-CoV-2 (acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Predictors with significant AUC at negative stratum should be either controlled for their confounders or eliminated (when confounders are unavailable). Models were classified according to the difference of AUC between strata. The framework was applied to an open database with 5644 patients from Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Brazil with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction) exam. C-reactive Protein (CRP) was a noisy predictor: hospitalization could have happen due to causes other than COVID-19 even when SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR is positive and CRP is reactive, as most cases are asymptomatic to mild. Candidates of characteristic response from moderate to severe inflammation of COVID-19 were: combinations of eosinophils, monocytes and neutrophils, with age as risk factor; and creatinine, as risk factor, sharpens the odds ratio of the model with monocytes, neutrophils, and age.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionCOVID-19 outbreak has imposed an eight-week confinement in France. During this period, children and their families were exposed to a full-time home life. The aim of this study was to assess the emotional experience and tolerance of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in this particular context.\n\nMethodA clinical survey was proposed to parents and rated by professionals once a week during the quarantine period in France. 95 autistic children followed by the child and adolescent psychiatry department of Tours university hospital were assessed from the 18th of March to the 8th of May. The following clinical points were investigated: child anxiety, family anxiety, behavior problems, impact on sleep, impact on appetite, impact on school work, family tension, confinement intolerance, difficulties to follow a schedule, isolation behavior.\n\nResultsDespite minor changes in family anxiety and school work, no difference was highlighted between clinical scores collected at the beginning and at the end of this period. ASD children with or without intellectual disability had non-significant clinical changes during quarantine. This evolution was also independent of the accommodation type (house or apartment) and the parental status (relationship, separated or isolated).\n\nConclusionThe sameness dimension in autism and parents adaptation may be involved in this clinical stability during COVID confinement. Moreover, specialized tools and support provided by professionals could have participated to these outcomes and must be regularly promoted in order to help families in this still difficult period.",

    "abstract": "The lockdown and social distancing policy imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have had a widespread impact on mental healthcare service provision and use. Previous reports from the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in South London) highlighted a shift to virtual contacts among those accessing community mental health and home treatment teams and an increase in deaths over the pandemics first wave. However, there is a need to quantify this for individuals with particular vulnerabilities, including those with learning disabilities and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Taking advantage of the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource with 24-hourly updates of electronic mental health records data, this paper describes daily caseloads and contact numbers (face-to-face and virtual) for individuals with potential neurodevelopmental disorders across community, specialist, crisis and inpatient services. The report focussed on the period 1st January to 31st July 2020. We also report on daily accepted and discharged trust referrals, total trust caseloads and daily inpatient admissions and discharges for individuals with potential neurodevelopmental disorders. In addition, daily deaths are described for all current and previous SLaM service users with potential neurodevelopmental disorders over this period. In summary, comparing periods before and after 16th March 2020 there was a shift from face-to-face contacts to virtual contacts across all teams. The largest declines in caseloads and total contacts were seen in Home Treatment Team, Liaison/A&E and Older Adult teams. Reduced accepted referrals and inpatient admissions were observed and there was an 103% increase in average daily deaths in the period after 16th March, compared to the period 1st January to 15th March (or a 282% increase if the 2-month period from 16th March to 15th May was considered alone).",

    "abstract": "Prognostic models to predict the risk of clinical deterioration in acute COVID-19 are required to inform clinical management decisions. Among 75,016 consecutive adults across England, Scotland and Wales prospectively recruited to the ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium (ISARIC4C) study, we developed and validated a multivariable logistic regression model for in-hospital clinical deterioration (defined as any requirement of ventilatory support or critical care, or death) using 11 routinely measured variables. We used internal-external cross-validation to show consistent measures of discrimination, calibration and clinical utility across eight geographical regions. We further validated the final model in held-out data from 8,252 individuals in London, with similarly consistent performance (C-statistic 0.77 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.78); calibration-in-the-large 0.01 (-0.04 to 0.06); calibration slope 0.96 (0.90 to 1.02)). Importantly, this model demonstrated higher net benefit than using other candidate scores to inform decision-making. Our 4C Deterioration model thus demonstrates unprecedented clinical utility and generalisability to predict clinical deterioration among adults hospitalised with COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Airborne spread of COVID-19 by infectious aerosol is all but certain. However, easily implemented approaches to assess the actual environmental threat are currently unavailable. We present a simple approach with the potential to rapidly provide information about the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the atmosphere at any location. We used a portable dehumidifier as a readily available and affordable tool to collect airborne virus in the condensate. The dehumidifiers were deployed in selected locations of a hospital ward with patients reporting flu like symptoms which could possibly be due to COVID-19 over three separate periods of one week. Samples were analyzed frequently for both virus envelope protein and SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In several samples across separate deployments, condensate from dehumidifiers tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens and confirmed using two independent assays. RNA was detected, but not attributable to SARS-CoV-2. Our results point to a facile pool testing method to sample air in any location in the world and assess the presence and concentration of the infectious agent in order to obtain quantitative risk assessment of exposure, designate zones as  hot spots and minimize the need for individual testing which may often be time consuming, expensive and laborious.",

    "abstract": "Covid-19 is a pandemic which has affected all parts of the world. Covid-19 is a pandemic which can be controlled only by maintaining social distancing, proper hygiene, wearing mask, hand sanitation and to a extend by wearing face shield. Even though each state has followed their own ways of controlling the infection, awareness among citizens and behaving as responsible citizens is very important in controlling this disease. Contact tracing plays an important role in controlling this pandemic. This paper deals with the effect of Covid-19 in various states of India and also forecasts its effect using machine learning techniques. Regression analysis like Linear and polynomial have been used for analysis of Covid-19, where Kaggle dataset has been used. This helps in understanding the much-affected states in India and helps to understand the infrastructure requirements to handle this pandemic efficiently.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has hit different parts of the world differently: some regions are still in the rise of the first wave, other regions are now facing a decline after a first wave, and yet other regions have started to see a second wave. The current immunity level i in a region is closely related to the cumulative fraction infected, which primarily depends on two factors: a) the initial potential for COVID-19 in the region (often quantified by the basic reproduction number R0), and b) the timing, amount and effectiveness of preventive measures put in place. By means of a mathematical model including heterogeneities owing to age, social activity and susceptibility, and allowing for time-varying preventive measures, the risk for a new epidemic wave and its doubling time, and how they depend on R0, i and the overall effect of the current preventive measures, are investigated. Focus lies on quantifying the minimal overall effect of preventive measures pMin needed to prevent a future outbreak. The first result shows that the current immunity level i plays a more influential roll than when immunity is obtained from vaccination. Secondly, by comparing regions with different R0 and i it is shown that regions with lower R0 and low i may now need higher preventive measures (pMin) compared with other regions having higher R0 but also higher i, even when such immunity levels are far from herd immunity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundStudies show that having some symptoms seems to be associated with more severe disease and poor prognosis. Therefore, knowing who is more susceptible to symptomatic COVID-19 disease is important to provide targeted preventive and management practice. The aim of the study was to assess the determinants of having symptomatic disease among COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia.\n\nMethodsA case-control study was conducted from August to September 2020 among a randomly selected 765 COVID-19 patients (372 Asymptomatic and 393 Symptomatic patients). Chi-square test and independent t-test were used to detect the presence of a statistically significant difference in the characteristics of the cases (symptomatic) and controls (asymptomatic), where p-value of <0.05 considered as having a statistically significant difference. Multivariable binary logistic regression was used to assess a statistically significant association between the independent variables and developing symptomatic COVID-19 where Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR), 95% CIs for AOR, and P-values were used for testing significance and interpretation of results.\n\nResultsThe result of the multivariable binary logistic regression shows that age group (AOR= 1.818, 95% CI= 1.210, 2.731, p-value=0.004 for 30-39 years; AOR= 1.611, 95% CI= 1.016, 2.554, p-value=0.043 for 40-49 years and AOR= 4.076, 95% CI= 2.582, 6.435, p-value=0.0001 for years and above), sex (AOR= 1.672, 95% CI= 1.216, 2.299, p-value=0.002) and history of diabetes mellitus (AOR= 2.406, 95% CI= 1.384, 4.181, p-value=0.002) were found to be significant factors that determine the development of symptomatic disease in COVID-19 patients.\n\nConclusionsDeveloping a symptomatic COVID-19 disease was found to be determined by exposures of old age, male sex, and being diabetic. Therefore, patients with the above factors should be given enough attention in the prevention and management process, including inpatient management, to pick symptoms earlier and to manage accordingly so that these patients can have a favorable treatment outcome.",

    "abstract": "This study uses mobility statistics combined with business census data for the eight Japanese prefectures with the highest COVID-19 infection rates to study the effect of mobility reductions on the effective reproduction number (i.e., the average number of secondary cases caused by one infected person). Mobility statistics are a relatively new data source created by compiling smartphone location data. Based on data for the first wave of infections in Japan, we found that reductions targeting the hospitality industry were more effective than restrictions on general business activities. Specifically, we found that to hold back the pandemic (that is, to reduce the effective reproduction number to one or less for all days), a 20-35% reduction in weekly mobility is required, depending on the region. A lesser goal, 80% of days with one or less observed transmission, can be achieved with a 6-30% reduction in weekly mobility. These are the results if other potential causes of spread are ignored; more careful observations and expanded data sets are needed.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding determinants of developing severe COVID-19 disease is important as studies show that severe disease is associated with worse outcomes.\n\nObjectiveThe study aimed to assess the determinants of COVID-19 disease severity among COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia.\n\nMethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted from June to August 2020 among randomly selected 686 patients. Chi-square test was used to detect the presence of a statistically significant difference in the characteristics of the patients based on disease severity (Mild Vs Moderate Vs Severe), where p-value of <0.05 was considered as having a statistically significant difference. A Multivariable multinomial logistic regression model was used to assess the presence of a significant association between the independent variables and COVID-19 disease severity where Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR), 95% CIs for AOR and P-values were used for testing significance and interpretation of results.\n\nResultsHaving moderate as compared with mild disease was significantly associated with having hypertension (AOR= 2.302, 95% CI= 1.266, 4.184, p-value=0.006), diabetes mellitus (AOR=2.607, 95% CI= 1.307, 5.198, p-value=0.007 for diabetes mellitus), fever (AOR= 6.115, 95% CI= 2.941, 12.716, p-value=0.0001) and headache (AOR= 2.695, 95% CI= 1.392, 5.215, p-value=0.003). Similarly, having severe disease as compared with mild disease was associated with age group (AOR= 4.428, 95% CI= 2.497, 7.853, p-value=0.0001 for 40-59 years and AOR=18.070, 95% CI=9.292, 35.140, p-value=0.0001 for [&ge;] 60 years), sex (AOR=1.842, 95% CI=1.121, 3.027, p-value=0.016), hypertension (AOR= 1.966, 95% CI= 1.076, 3.593, p-value=0.028), diabetes mellitus (AOR= 3.926, 95% CI= 1.964, 7.847, p-value=0.0001), fever (AOR= 13.218, 95% CI= 6.109, 28.601, p-value=0.0001) and headache (AOR= 4.816, 95% CI= 2.324, 9.979, p-value=0.0001). In addition, determinants of severe disease as compared with moderate disease were found to be age group (AOR= 4.871, 95% CI= 2.854, 8.315, p-value=0.0001 for 40-59 years and AOR= 18.906, 95% CI= 9.838, 36.334, p-value=0.0001 for [&ge;] 60 years), fever (AOR= 2.161, 95% CI= 1.286, 3.634, p-value=0.004) and headache (AOR= 1.787, 95% CI= 1.028, 3.107, p-value=0.039).\n\nConclusionsBeing old, male sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and having symptoms of fever and headache were found to be determinants of developing a more severe COVID-19 disease category. We recommend a better preventive practice to be set in place so that these groups of patients can be protected from acquiring the disease. And for those who are already infected, a more careful follow-up and management should be given so that complication and death can be prevented. Furthermore, considering the above non respiratory symptoms as disease severity indicator could be important.",

    "abstract": "The transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) becomes pandemic but presents different incidences in the world. Mathematical models were formulated to describe the coronavirus disease 2019 (CoViD-19) epidemic in each country or region. At the beginning of the pandemic, many authors used the SIR (susceptible, infectious, and recovered compartments) and SEIR (including exposed compartment) models to estimate the basic reproduction number R0 for the CoViD-19 epidemic. These simple deterministic models assumed that the only available collection of the severe CoViD-19 cases transmitted the SARS-CoV-2 and estimated lower values for R0, ranging from 1.5 to 3.0. However, the major flaw in the estimation of R0 provided by the SIR and SEIR models was that the severe CoViD-19 patients were hospitalized, and, consequently, not transmitting. Hence, we proposed a more elaborate model considering the natural history of CoViD-19: the inclusion of asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, mild and severe CoViD-19 compartments. The model also encompassed the fatality rate depending on age. This SEAPMDR model estimated R0 using the severe CoViD-19 data from Sao Paulo State (Brazil) and Spain, yielding higher values for R0, that is, 6.54 and 5.88, respectively. It is worth stressing that this model assumed that severe CoViD-19 cases were not participating in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission chain. Therefore, the SIR and SEIR models are not suitable to estimate R0 at the beginning of the epidemic by considering the isolated severe CoViD-19 data as transmitters.",

    "abstract": "Virologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 has been central to the COVID-19 pandemic response, but interpreting changes in incidence and fraction of positive tests towards understanding the epidemic trajectory is confounded by changes in testing practices. Here, we show that the distribution of viral loads, in the form of Cycle thresholds (Ct), from positive surveillance samples at a single point in time can provide accurate estimation of an epidemics trajectory, subverting the need for repeated case count measurements which are frequently obscured by changes in testing capacity. We identify a relationship between the population-level cross-sectional distribution of Ct values and the growth rate of the epidemic, demonstrating how the skewness and median of detectable Ct values change purely as a mathematical epidemiologic rule without any change in individual level viral load kinetics or testing. Although at the individual level measurement variation can complicate interpretation of Ct values for clinical use, we show that population-level properties reflect underlying epidemic dynamics. In support of these theoretical findings, we observe a strong relationship between the time-varying effective reproductive number, R(t), and the distribution of Cts among positive surveillance specimens, including median and skewness, measured in Massachusetts over time. We use the observed relationships to derive a novel method that allows accurate inference of epidemic growth rate using the distribution of Ct values observed at a single cross-section in time, which, unlike estimates based on case counts, is less susceptible to biases from delays in test results and from changing testing practices. Our findings suggest that instead of discarding individual Ct values from positive specimens, incorporation of viral loads into public health data streams offers a new approach for real-time resource allocation and assessment of outbreak mitigation strategies, even where repeat incidence data is not available. Ct values or similar viral load data should be regularly reported to public health officials by testing centers and incorporated into monitoring programs.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic, is evolving into different genetic variants by accumulating mutations as it spreads globally. In addition to this diversity of consensus genomes across patients, RNA viruses can also display genetic diversity within individual hosts, and co-existing viral variants may affect disease progression and the success of medical interventions. To systematically examine the intra-patient genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2, we processed a large cohort of 3939 publicly-available deeply sequenced genomes with specialised bioinformatics software, along with 749 recently sequenced samples from Switzerland. We found that the distribution of diversity across patients and across genomic loci is very unbalanced with a minority of hosts and positions accounting for much of the diversity. For example, the D614G variant in the Spike gene, which is present in the consensus sequences of 67.4% of patients, is also highly diverse within hosts, with 29.7% of the public cohort being affected by this coexistence and exhibiting different variants. We also investigated the impact of several technical and epidemiological parameters on genetic heterogeneity and found that age, which is known to be correlated with poor disease outcomes, is a significant predictor of viral genetic diversity.\n\nAuthor SummarySince it arose in late 2019, the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) behind the COVID-19 pandemic has mutated and evolved during its global spread. Individual patients may host different versions, or variants, of the virus, hallmarked by different mutations. We examine the diversity of genetic variants coexisting within patients across a cohort of 3939 publicly accessible samples and 749 recently sequenced samples from Switzerland. We find that a small number of patients carry most of the diversity, and that patients with more diversity tend to be older. We also find that most of the diversity is concentrated in certain regions and positions of the virus genome. In particular, we find that a variant reported to increase infectivity is among the most diverse positions. Our study provides a large-scale survey of within-patient diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 genome.",

    "abstract": "AimTo estimate time to recovery/convalescence and identify determinants among COVID-19 infected patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n\nMethodsA prospective cohort study was conducted among a randomly selected sample of 360 COVID-19 patients who were on follow up from 2nd June to 5th July 2020. Kaplan Meier plots, median survival times, and Log-rank test were used to describe the data and compare survival distribution between groups. Association between time to recovery/ convalescence and determinants was assessed using the Cox proportional hazard survival model, where hazard ratio, P-value, and 95% CI for hazard ratio were used for testing significance.\n\nResultsThe mean age of the participants was 32.4 years ({+/-} 12.5 years). On admission, 86.9 % had mild COVID-19, 78.6% were asymptomatic and 11.4% of the patients had a history of pre-existing co-morbid illness. The Median time to recovery/ convalescence among the study population was 16 days. The log-rank test shows that having non-mild (moderate and severe) disease, having one or more symptoms at presentation, and presenting with respiratory and constitutional symptoms seems to extend the time needed to achieve recovery. The Final Cox regression result shows that the presence of symptom at presentation was found to be a significant factor that affects time to recovery/ convalescence, the rate of achieving recovery/ convalescence among symptomatic patients was 44% lower than patients who were asymptomatic at presentation (HR= 0.560, 95% CI= 0.322-0.975, p-value=0.040).\n\nConclusionsPresence of symptom was found to be associated with delayed viral clearance. This implies symptomatic patients are more likely to be infectious because of the prolonged viral shedding in addition to the presence of a more concentrated virus in the upper respiratory tract that enhances the transmission. Therefore, attention should be given in the isolation and treatment practice of COVID-19 patients with regard to presence of symptom.\n\nKey MessagesO_LIThe study assessed the time to RT-PCR proven recovery (two consecutive negative viral shedding) and identified determinants that affected the time.\nC_LIO_LISymptomatic infection is associated with delayed viral clearance.\nC_LIO_LIThe finding of the study could be used to guide the isolation and treatment practice.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPeople with active cancer are recognised as at risk of COVID-19 complications, but it is unclear whether the much larger population of cancer survivors is at elevated risk. We aimed to address this by comparing cancer survivors and cancer-free controls for (i) prevalence of comorbidities considered risk factors for COVID-19; and (ii) risk of severe influenza, as a marker of susceptibility to severe outcomes from epidemic respiratory viruses.\n\nMethodsWe included survivors ([&ge;]1 year) of the 20 most common cancers, and age, sex and general practice-matched cancer-free controls, derived from UK primary care data linked to cancer registrations, hospital admissions and death registrations. Comorbidity prevalences were calculated 1 and 5 years from cancer diagnosis. Risk of hospitalisation or death due to influenza was compared using Cox models adjusted for baseline demographics and comorbidities.\n\nFindings108,215 cancer survivors and 523,541 cancer-free controls were included. Cancer survivors had more asthma, other respiratory, cardiac, diabetes, neurological, renal, and liver disease, and less obesity, compared with controls, but there was variation by cancer site. There were 205 influenza hospitalisations/deaths, with cancer survivors at higher risk than controls (adjusted HR 2.78, 95% CI 2.04-3.80). Haematological cancer survivors had large elevated risks persisting for >10 years (HR overall 15.17, 7.84-29.35; HR >10 years from cancer diagnosis 10.06, 2.47-40.93). Survivors of other cancers had evidence of raised risk up to 5 years from cancer diagnosis only (HR 2.22, 1.31-3.74).\n\nInterpretationRisks of severe COVID-19 outcomes are likely to be elevated in cancer survivors. This should be taken into account in policies targeted at clinical risk groups, and vaccination for both influenza, and, when available, COVID-19, should be encouraged in cancer survivors.\n\nFundingWellcome Trust, Royal Society, NIHR.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSFew data are available to date on how COVID-19 affects cancer survivors. We searched PubMed with the keywords \"influenza cancer survivors\" to identify studies that compared severe influenza outcomes in cancer survivors and in a control group. No study was identified.\n\nAdded value of this studyIn this matched cohort study of routinely collected electronic health records, we demonstrated raised risks of influenza hospitalisation or mortality in survivors from haematological malignancies for >10 years after diagnosis, and in survivors from solid cancers up to 5 years after diagnosis.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceCancer survivorship appears to be an important risk factor for severe influenza outcomes, suggesting that cancer survivors may also be at raised risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes. This should be taken into account in public health policies targeted at protecting clinical risk groups. Influenza vaccination should be encouraged in this group, and may need to be extended to a wider population of medium- to long-term cancer survivors than currently recommended.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEarly observational studies suggested that the use of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, specifically angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, may increase the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and adversely affect the prognosis or survival of infected patients. To explore the impact of RAS inhibitor use on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, from all published studies.\n\nMethods and FindingsA systematic review and meta-analysis of the use of RAS inhibitors in relation to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and/or the severity and mortality associated with COVID-19 was conducted. English language bibliographic databases PubMed, Web of Science, OVID Embase, Scopus, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, searched from Jan 1st, 2020 to July 20th, 2020. 58 observational studies (69,200 COVID-19 patients and 3,103,335 controls) were included. There was no difference in the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection between RAS inhibitor users and non-users (unadjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.21), (adjusted OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.02), (adjusted HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.31). There was no significant difference in the severe Covid-19 case rate between RAS inhibitor users and non-users (unadjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.36), (adjusted OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.12), or in mortality due to COVID-19 between RAS inhibitor users and non-users (unadjusted OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.44), (adjusted OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23), (adjusted HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.14).\n\nConclusionsIn the most comprehensive analysis of all available data to date, treatment with RAS inhibitors was not associated with increased risk of infection, severity of disease, or mortality due to COVID-19. The best available evidence suggests that these treatments should not be discontinued on the basis of concern about risk associated with COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOutbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 have occurred worldwide in Long Term Care Facilities (LTCFs), but the reasons why some facilities are particularly vulnerable to infection are poorly understood. We aimed to identify risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outbreaks in LTCFs.\n\nMethodsCross-sectional survey of all LTCFs providing dementia care or care to adults >65 years in England with linkage to SARS-CoV-2 test results. Exposures included: LTCF characteristics, staffing factors, and use of disease control measures. Main outcomes included risk factors for infection and outbreaks, estimated using multivariable logistic regression, and survey and test-based weighted estimates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence.\n\nFindings5126/9081 (56%) LTCFs participated in the survey, with 160,033 residents and 248,594 staff. The weighted period prevalence of infection in residents and staff respectively was 10.5% (95% CI: 9.9-11.1%) and 3.8% (95%: 3.4-4.2%) and 2724 LTCFs (53.1%) had [&ge;]1 infection. Odds of infection and/or outbreaks were reduced in LTCFs that paid sickness pay, cohorted staff, did not employ agency staff and had higher staff to resident ratios. Higher odds of infection and outbreaks were identified in facilities with more admissions, lower cleaning frequency, poor compliance with isolation and \"for profit\" status.\n\nInterpretationHalf of LTCFs had no cases suggesting they remain vulnerable to outbreaks. Reducing transmission from staff requires adequate sick pay, minimal use of temporary staff, improved staffing ratios and staff cohorting. Transmission from residents is associated with the number of admissions to the facility and poor compliance with isolation.\n\nFundingUK Government Department of Health & Social Care\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSCOVID-19 outbreaks have occurred worldwide in long-term care facilities (LTCFs), which provide care to elderly and vulnerable residents, and are associated with high mortality. The reasons why LTCFs are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 are poorly understood. Most studies of risk factors for COVID-19 to date have been limited by scale, and poor quality administrative, demographic and infection control data. We conducted a systematic search on 27 July 2020 in MEDLINE Ovid, WHO COVID-19 database and in MedRxiv to identify studies reporting risk factors for COVID-19 infection or outbreaks in LTCFs, with no date or language restrictions. We used the search terms \"COVID-19\", \"SARS-CoV-2\", \"coronavirus\" and \"care home\", \"nursing home\", \"long term care facilit\" and excluded studies that did not investigate LTCF-level risk factors. 14 studies met our inclusion criteria comprising 11 cross-sectional studies and 3 surveys. The largest cross-sectional study was conducted in 9395 specialised nursing facilities across 30 states in USA; the largest survey was conducted in 124 LTCFs in Haute-Garrone region of France. Risk of bias was high across all studies, and results could not be pooled due to heterogeneity between studies. Main risk factors for infection and/or outbreaks related to the size of the facility, lower ratios of staff to residents, urban location, higher occupancy, and the community prevalence of infection. Only one study collected data on the use of disease control measures during the pandemic, and no studies provided data on risk factors such as the use of temporary staff, or the impact of staff working across multiple locations.\n\nAdded value of this studyWe conducted a national telephone survey with managers of all LTCFs in England which provided dementia care or care to residents aged > 65 years to collect data on the number of staff and residents in each facility, confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, characteristics of the facility e.g.size, staffing (use of temporary staff, staffing ratios, sickness pay) and disease control measures such as cohorting and isolation. We identified risk factors for infection in residents and staff, outbreaks (defined as [&ge;]1 case per LTCF) and large outbreaks using logistic regression. We also estimated the proportion of staff and residents who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Responses were obtained from 5126 of out 9081 (56%) of eligible LTCFs. To our knowledge, this is the largest and most detailed survey of risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outbreaks that has been conducted in LTCFs.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceAlmost half of LTCFs surveyed in this study did not report any cases of infection, and remain vulnerable to infection and outbreaks, highlighting the need for effective control measures. Reducing transmission from staff requires adequate sick pay, minimal use of temporary staff, improved staffing ratios and staff cohorting. Transmission from residents is associated with the number of admissions to the facility and poor compliance with control measures such as isolation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundREACT-1 is a community survey of PCR confirmed swab-positivity for SARS-CoV-2 among random samples of the population in England. This interim report includes data from the fifth round of data collection currently underway for swabs sampled from the 18th to 26th September 2020.\n\nMethodsRepeated cross-sectional surveys of random samples of the population aged 5 years and over in England with sample size ranging from 120,000 to 160,000 people in each round of data collection. Collection of self-administered nose and throat swab for PCR and questionnaire data. Prevalence of swab-positivity by round and by demographic variables including age, sex, region, ethnicity. Estimation of reproduction number (R) between and within rounds, and time trends using exponential growth or decay model. Assessment of geographical clustering based on boundary-free spatial model.\n\nResultsOver the 9 days for which data are available, we find 363 positives from 84,610 samples giving a weighted prevalence to date of 0.55% (0.47%, 0.64%) in round 5. This implies that 411,000 (351,000, 478,000) people in England are virus-positive under the assumption that the swab assay is 75% sensitive. Using data from the most recent two rounds, we estimate a doubling time of 10.6 (9.4, 12.0) days covering the period 20th August to 26th September, corresponding to a reproduction number R of 1.47 (1.40, 1.53). Using data only from round 5 we estimate a reproduction number of 1.06 (0.74, 1.46) with probability of 63% that R is greater than 1. Between rounds 4 and 5 there was a marked increase in unweighted prevalence at all ages. In the most recent data, prevalence was highest in the 18 to 24 yrs age group at 0.96% (0.68%, 1.36%). At 65+ yrs prevalence increased [~]7-fold between rounds 4 and 5 from 0.04% (0.03%, 0.07%) to 0.29% (0.23%, 0.37%). Prevalence increased in all regions between rounds 4 and 5, giving the highest unweighted prevalence in round 5 in the North West at 0.86% (0.69%, 1.06%). In London, prevalence increased [~]5-fold from 0.10% (0.06%, 0.17%) to 0.49% (0.36%, 0.68%). Regional R values ranged from 1.32 (1.16,1.50) in Yorkshire and the Humber to 1.63 (1.42, 1.88) in the East Midlands over the same period. In the most recent data, there was extensive clustering in the North West, Midlands and in and around London with pockets of clustering in other regions including the South West, North East and East of England. Odds of swab-positivity were [~]2-fold higher in people of Asian and Black ethnicity compared with white participants.\n\nConclusionRapid growth has led to high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in England among all regions and age groups, including those age groups at highest risk. Although there is evidence of a recent deceleration in the epidemic, current levels of prevalence will inevitably result in additional hospitalisations and mortality in coming weeks. A re-doubling of public health efforts is needed to return to a declining phase of the epidemic.",

    "abstract": "In the situation where expansion of coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19) does not stop, there is concern about co-infection of people with the seasonal influenza infections from late autumn to winter 2020. Therefore, the importance of supplying vaccines against the seasonal influenza has been pointed out all over the world. As an example in Japan, the number of people infected with the seasonal influenza, hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, and pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF), which are the seasonal infectious diseases in the 2020 season, has decreased remarkably compared to the number of people infected each year. It is believed that the significant reduction in the number of people infected with these seasonal infectious diseases is a result of the pervasive hand washing, wearing masks and maintaining social distance in COVID-19 rea. To examine the correlation between the three factors of the number of people with each seasonal infectious disease, the mask wearing rate, and the outing rate, we created a three-dimensional scatter plot based on these three factors using principal component analysis. Our research findings demonstrated preventive effect of no going out against co-infection with the seasonal influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBrazil has the third-highest number of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases worldwide. Understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 from reported cases is challenging due to heterogeneous testing rates. We estimated the number of COVID-19 cases in Brazil on a national and regional level using digital technology.\n\nMethodsWe used a web-based application to perform a population-based survey from March 21st to August 29th, 2020 in Brazil. We obtained responses from 243 461 individuals across all federative units, who answered questions on COVID-19-related symptoms, chronic diseases and address of residence. COVID-19 was defined as at least one of the following: fever, cough, dyspnea and nasal flaring, associated with a history of close contact with a suspect or confirmed COVID-19 case in the previous 14 days. A stratified two-stage weighted survey analysis was performed to estimate the population level prevalence of COVID-19 cases.\n\nResultsAfter calibration weighing, we estimated that 10 339 461 cases of COVID-19 occurred, yielding a 2.75 estimated infection per officially reported case. Estimated/reported ratios varied across Brazilian states and were higher in states with lower human development indexes. Areas with lower income levels displayed higher rates of COVID-19 cases (66 vs 38 cases/1000 people in the lowest and highest income strata respectively, p<0.001), but presented lower rates of COVID-19 testing.\n\nConclusionIn this population-based survey using digital technology in Brazil, we estimated that the COVID-19 case rates were 2.75 times higher than officially reported. The estimated per reported case ratios were higher in areas with worse socioeconomic status.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic exposed difficulties in scaling current quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based diagnostic methodologies for large-scale infectious disease testing. Bottlenecks include the lengthy multi-step process of nucleic acid extraction followed by qPCR readouts, which require costly instrumentation and infrastructure, as well as reagent and plastic consumable shortages stemming from supply chain constraints. Here we report a novel Oil Immersed Lossless Total Analysis System (OIL-TAS), which integrates RNA extraction and detection onto a single device that is simple, rapid, cost effective, uses minimal supplies and requires reduced infrastructure to perform. We validated the performance of OIL-TAS using contrived samples containing inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viral particles, which show that the assay can reliably detect an input concentration of 10 copies/L and sporadically detect down to 1 copy/L. The OIL-TAS method can serve as a faster, cheaper, and easier-to-deploy alternative to current qPCR-based methods for infectious disease testing.",

    "abstract": "Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, many rumors have emerged. Given prior research linking rumor exposure to mental well-being, we conducted a nation-wide survey to document the base rate of rumor exposure and factors associated with rumor vulnerability. Between March to July 2020, 1237 participants were surveyed on 5 widely-disseminated COVID-19 rumors (that drinking water frequently could be preventive, that eating garlic could be preventive, that the outbreak arose because of bat soup consumption, that the virus was created in an American lab, and that the virus was created in a Chinese lab). For each rumor, participants reported whether they had heard, shared or believed each rumor. Although most participants had been exposed to COVID-19 rumors, few shared or believed these. Sharing behaviors sometimes occurred in the absence of belief; however, education emerged as a protective factor for both sharing and belief. Together, our results suggest that campaigns targeting skills associated with higher education (e.g. epistemology) may prove more effective than counter-rumor messages.\n\nHighlightsO_LIPrior studies linked exposure to COVID-19 rumors with poor mental health.\nC_LIO_LIIn a community sample, most participants reported having heard rumors.\nC_LIO_LIFew participants shared or believed rumors.\nC_LIO_LISharing sometimes occurred in the absence of belief.\nC_LIO_LIMore educated individuals believed and shared fewer rumors.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "An unprecedented outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the form of peculiar pneumonia has spread globally since its first case at Wuhan, China, in December 2019, increasing infected cases and mortality at a pandemic speed. Thus, forecasting the COVID-19 pandemic became a key research interest for both the epidemiologists and statisticians. These future predictions are useful for the effective allocation of health care resources, stockpiling, and help in strategic planning for clinicians, government authorities, and public-health policymakers after understanding the extent of the effect. The main objective of this paper is to develop the most suitable forecasting model that can generate real-time short-term (ten days) and long-term (fifty days) out-of-sample forecasts of COVID-19 outbreaks for eight profoundly affected countries, namely the United States of America, Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa, Mexico, Spain, and Iran. A novel hybrid approach based on the Theta model and Autoregressive neural network (ARNN) model, named Theta-ARNN (TARNN) model, is proposed. The proposed method outperforms previously available single and hybrid forecasting models for COVID-19 predictions in most data sets. In addition, the ergodicity and asymptotic stationarity of the proposed TARNN model are established which is of particular interest in nonlinear time series literature. An R-Shiny application is created for implementation of TARNN model and is publicly available1.",

    "abstract": "Over the last months, cases of SARS-CoV-2 surged repeatedly in many countries and could often be controlled with non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing. We analyzed de-identified GPS tracking data from 1.15 to 1.4 million cell phones in Germany per day between March-November 2020 to identify encounters between individuals and statistically evaluate large-scale contact behavior. Using graph sampling theory we estimated the contact index (CI), a metric for number and heterogeneity of contacts and found that the contact index, and not the total number of contacts, is an accurate predsictor for the effective reproduction number R. A high correlation between CI and R occurring more than two weeks later allows timely assessment of the social behavior well before the infections become detectable. The CI quantifies the role of superspreading and allows assigning risks to specific contact behavior. We provide a critical CI-value beyond which R is expected to rise above 1 and propose to use it to leverage the social distancing interventions for the coming months.",

    "abstract": "A major issue in identification of protective T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 lies in distinguishing people infected with SARS-CoV-2 from those with cross-reactive immunity generated by exposure to other coronaviruses. We characterised SARS-CoV-2 T cell immune responses in 168 PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects and 118 seronegative subjects without known SARS-CoV-2 exposure using a range of T cell assays that differentially capture immune cell function. Strong ex vivo ELISpot and proliferation responses to multiple antigens (including M, NP and ORF3) were found in those who had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 but were rare in pre-pandemic and unexposed seronegative subjects. However, seronegative doctors with high occupational exposure and recent COVID-19 compatible illness showed patterns of T cell responses characteristic of infection, indicating that these readouts are highly sensitive. By contrast, over 90% of convalescent or unexposed people showed proliferation and cellular lactate responses to spike subunits S1/S2, indicating pre-existing cross-reactive T cell populations. The detection of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 is therefore critically dependent on the choice of assay and antigen. Memory responses to specific non-spike proteins provides a method to distinguish recent infection from pre-existing immunity in exposed populations.",

    "abstract": "The shortage of N95 masks have spurred efforts on developing safe and scientifically-validated decontamination and reuse protocols that are easily scalable and universally applicable even in low-resource settings. We report on the development and implementation of a heat-based N95 mask decontamination system in a large hospital setting (Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India) with over 8000 N95 masks from about 1400 individual users decontaminated and in reuse till date. We describe the challenges and constraints in choosing a proven, scalable, and easy-to-implement decontamination solution. We discuss the heat treatment and particle filtration efficiency measurement experiments done to validate a decontamination treatment protocol at a target temperature of 70{degrees}C for a duration of 60 minutes, and the scaling up of this method using a standard hot drying cabinet at the hospital. The logistics of ensuring optimal utilization of the decontamination facility without compromising on basic safety principles are detailed. Our method relies on equipment available in standard hospitals, is simple to set-up, scalable, and can be easily replicated in low-resource settings. We further believe such limited reuse strategies, even in times of abundant N95 mask availability, would not only be cost-saving but also be environmentally responsible in reducing the amount of medical waste.",

Objectives To describe outcomes with high-flow oxygen delivered through nasal cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in COVID-19 AHRF and identify individual factors associated with failure. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized adults with COVID-19 treated with HFNC and/or NIPPV to describe rates of success (live discharge without endotracheal intubation (ETI)), and identify characteristics associated with failure (ETI and/or in-hospital mortality) using Fine-Gray sub-distribution hazard models. Results A total of 331 and 747 patients received HFNC and NIPPV as the highest level of non-invasive respiratory support, respectively; 154 (46.5%) in the HFNC cohort and 167 (22.4%) in the NIPPV cohort were successfully discharged without requiring ETI. In adjusted models, significantly increased risk of HFNC and NIPPV failure was seen among patients with cardiovascular disease (subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) 1.82; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.17-2.83 and sHR 1.40; 95% CI 1.06-1.84), respectively, and among those with lower oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2) ratio at HFNC and NIPPV initiation (sHR, 0.32; 95% CI 0.19-0.54, and sHR 0.34; 95% CI 0.21-0.55, respectively). Conclusions A significant proportion of patients receiving non-invasive respiratory modalities for COVID-19 AHRF achieved successful discharge without requiring ETI, with lower success rates among those with cardiovascular disease or more severe hypoxia. The role of non-invasive respiratory modalities in COVID-19 related AHRF requires further consideration.",

    "abstract": "How do we forecast an emerging pandemic in real time in a purely data-driven manner? How to leverage rich heterogeneous data based on various signals such as mobility, testing, and/or disease exposure for forecasting? How to handle noisy data and generate uncertainties in the forecast? In this paper, we present DO_SCPLOWEEPC_SCPLOWCO_SCPLOWOVIDC_SCPLOW, an operational deep learning framework designed for real-time COVID-19 forecasting. DO_SCPLOWEEPC_SCPLOW-CO_SCPLOWOVIDC_SCPLOW works well with sparse data and can handle noisy heterogeneous data signals by propagating the uncertainty from the data in a principled manner resulting in meaningful uncertainties in the forecast. The deployed framework also consists of modules for both real-time and retrospective exploratory analysis to enable interpretation of the forecasts. Results from real-time predictions (featured on the CDC website and FiveThirtyEight.com) since April 2020 indicates that our approach is competitive among the methods in the COVID-19 Forecast Hub, especially for short-term predictions.",

Method: We conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study and data from 99,993 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were analyzed. Results: The overall risk of reinfection (28 or more elapsed days between both episodes onset) was 0.21%, and older subjects and those with mild primary disease were at reduced risk of reinfection. Healthcare workers and immunosuppressed or renal patients had at greater risk of SARS-COV-2 reinfection. Conclusions: If replicated in other populations, these results may be useful to prioritize efforts focusing on the reduction of SARS-COV-2 spread and the related burden.",

    "abstract": "We provide an explanation for the apparent discrepancy between the dynamic of the positive COVID-19 test rates and of the numbers of COVID-19-related hospital and intensive care admissions and deaths in France. We highlight the existence of a latency period of around 5 weeks between the infections of young individual (generally asymptomatic) to older individuals that may have a severe form of the disease and may be hospitalized. If the overall positive detection rate provided relevant information until the end of August, since the beginning of September the overall positive detection rate has reached a plateau and no longer provides relevant information on the current state of the epidemic. We show that the incidence rate in the 70+ age group is a relevant and early indicator of the epidemic. Furthermore, we have shown an identical doubling time of around 15 days for the following indicators: the incidence rate for the 70+ age group, the number of new admissions to hospital, intensive care unit admissions and deaths.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Soon, it has spread out across the world and become an ongoing pandemic. In Bangladesh, the first case of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was detected on March 8, 2020. Since then, not many significant studies have been conducted to understand the transmission dynamics of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh. In this study, we estimated the basic reproduction number R0 of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh. Methods: The data of daily confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh and the reported values of generation time of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) for Singapore and Tianjin, China, were collected. We calculated the basic reproduction number R0 by applying the exponential growth (EG) method. Epidemic data of the first 76 days and different values of generation time were used for the calculation. Results: The basic reproduction number R0 of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh is estimated to be 2.66 [95% CI: 2.58-2.75], optimized R0 is 2.78 [95% CI: 2.69-2.88] using generation time 5.20 with a standard deviation of 1.72 for Singapore. Using generation time 3.95 with a standard deviation of 1.51 for Tianjin, China, R0 is estimated to be 2.15 [95% CI: 2.09-2.20], optimized R0 is 2.22 [95% CI: 2.16-2.29]. Conclusions: The calculated basic reproduction number R0 of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh is significantly higher than 1, which indicates its high transmissibility and contagiousness.",

    "abstract": "Under public health emergencies, particularly an early epidemic, it is fundamental that genetic and other healthcare data is shared across borders in both a timely and accurate manner before the outbreak of a global pandemic. However, although the COVID-19 pandemic has created a tidal wave of data, most patient data is siloed, not easily accessible, and due to low sample size, largely not actionable. Based on the precision medicine platform Shivom, a novel and secure data sharing and data analytics marketplace, we developed a versatile pandemic preparedness platform that allows healthcare professionals to rapidly share and analyze genetic data. The platform solves several problems of the global medical and research community, such as siloed data, cross-border data sharing, lack of state-of-the-art analytic tools, GDPR-compliance, and ease-of-use. The platform serves as a central marketplace of  discoverability. The platform combines patient genomic & omics data sets, a marketplace for AI & bioinformatics algorithms, new diagnostic tools, and data-sharing capabilities to advance virus epidemiology and biomarker discovery. The bioinformatics marketplace contains some preinstalled COVID-19 pipelines to analyze virus- and host genomes without the need for bioinformatics expertise. The platform will be the quickest way to rapidly gain insight into the association between virus-host interactions and COVID-19 in various populations which can have a significant impact on managing the current pandemic and potential future disease outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "The IFR (Infection Fatality Risk) is one of the most important parameters of an infectious disease. If properly estimated, the observed number of deaths divided by the IFR can be used to estimate the current number of infections and, if immunity is permanent, we can estimate the fraction of susceptible which can be used to plan reopening of activities and vaccine deployment, when these become available. Here we suggest how to use the observed deaths by COVID-19 in an arbitrary population as a surrogate for the progression of the epidemic with the purpose of decision making. We compare several estimates of IFR for SARS-CoV-2 with our estimate that uses the number of additional deaths in households in a database population of 159,150 laboratory-confirmed (RT-qPCR) COVID-19 by SARS-COV-2 in Mexico. The main result is that if the number of deaths in a region is close to 2 per thousand individuals, the fraction of remaining susceptible may be too small for the vaccine to make a difference in the total number of infected.",

    "abstract": "Background. By mid-September of 2020, the number of daily new infections in India have crossed 95,000. To facilitate an intuition for the spatio-temporal development of the pandemic and to help resource deployment planning, we analyze and describe how the disease burden almost-predictably shifted from large metropolitan districts to sub-urban districts. Methods. We gathered the publicly available granular data from 186 different districts (equivalent of counties) on their COVID-19 infections and deaths during the 15 April to 31 August 2020 period. These districts presented an active case burden of 559,566 and a cumulative 2,715,656 infections as of August 31. The epidemiological data of these districts was fit to a susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-recovered-dead (SAIRD) model and the underlying epidemic parameters for each of these districts during the course of 4 months was estimated. We validated these parameters against known epidemiological characteristic distributions and analyzed them to understand their changes in space-time during the pandemic. Findings. The center of the burden of the current-active infections which on May 15 was in the large metro districts with most international access shifted continuously and smoothly shifted towards districts which could be accessed by domestic airports and by trains. A linear trend-analysis showed a continuous improvement in most epidemic parameters consistently across the districts with four categories of accessibility from an international travel perspective - large metro, metro, urban and sub-urban districts. The reproduction numbers improved from 1.77{+/-}0.58 on May 15 to 1.07{+/-} 0.13 on August 31 in large metro districts (p-Value of trend 0.0001053); and from 1.58{+/-}0.39 on May 15 to 0.94{+/-}0.11 on August 31 in sub-urban districts (p-Value of trend 0.0067). The recovery rate per infected person per day improved from 0.0581{+/-}0.009 on May 15 to 0.091{+/-}0.010 on August 31 in large metro districts (p-Value of trend 0.26.10^{-12}); and from 0.059{+/-}0.011 on May 15 to 0.100{+/-}0.010 on August 31 in sub-urban districts (p-Value of trend 0.12.10{-16}). The death rate of symptomatic individuals which includes the case-fatality-rate as well as the time from symptoms to death, consistently decreased from 0.0025{+/-}0.0014 on May 15 to 0.0013{+/-}0.0003 on August 31 in large metro districts (p-Value of trend 0.0010); and from 0.0018{+/-}0.0008 on May 15 to 0.0014{+/-}0.0003 on August 31 in sub-urban districts (p-Value of trend 0.2789. Interpretation. As the daily infections continue to rise at a national level, it is important to notice a `local-flattening' in larger metro districts, and a shift of the pandemic-burden towards smaller sized districts in a clear hierarchical fashion of accessibility from an international travel perspective. The pandemic burden shifting towards remotely accessible regions, with possibly lesser health care facilities, is a call for attention to the re-organization of resources.",

    "abstract": "Recent findings suggest that an adequate test-trace-isolate (TTI) strategy is needed to prevent a secondary COVID-19 wave with the reopening of society in the UK. Here we assess the potential importance of mandatory masks in the parts of community and in secondary schools. We show that, assuming current TTI levels, adoption of masks in secondary schools in addition to community settings can reduce the size of a second wave, but will not prevent it; more testing of symptomatic people, tracing and isolating of their contacts is also needed. To avoid a second wave, with masks mandatory in secondary schools and in certain community settings, under current tracing levels, 68% or 46% of those with symptomatic infection would need to be tested if masks effective coverage were 15% or 30% respectively, compared to 76% and 57% if masks are mandated in community settings but not secondary schools.",

    "abstract": "During a crisis, the messaging platform WhatsApp allows crisis-related information to be disseminated quickly. Although case studies have documented how WhatsApp has shaped crisis outcomes in both beneficial and harmful ways, little is known about: (i) how crisis-related content is spread; (ii) characteristics of users based on usage patterns; or (iii) how usage patterns link to well-being. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, this study used the experience sampling method to track the daily WhatsApp usage of 151 adults throughout one week (capturing a total of 924 days of crisis-related communication). Each day, participants reported the extent to which they had received, forwarded, or discussed COVID-19- related content. During the week-long monitoring, most participants (94.7%) reported at least one COVID-19 related use of WhatsApp. Those who engaged with more COVID-19 content in personal chats were more likely to report having COVID-19 thoughts throughout the day. We further observed that around 1 in 10 individuals (14%) were chronic users who received and shared forwarded COVID-19 messages at a high volume; this group may represent everyday \"super spreaders\" of crisis-related content. Together, these findings provide an empirical base for policy makers to manage risk communication during large-scale crises.",

    "abstract": "Recently, respiratory aerosols with diameters smaller than 100 m have been con- firmed as important vectors for the spread of SARS-CoV-2. While cloth masks afford some protection for larger ballistic droplets, they are typically inefficient at filtering these aerosols and require specialized fabrication devices to produce. We describe a fabrication technique that makes use of a folding procedure (origami) to transform a filtration material into a mask. These origami masks can be fabricated by non-experts at minimal cost and effort, provide adequate filtration efficiencies, and are easily scaled to different facial sizes. Using a mannequin fit test simulator, we demonstrate that these masks can provide optimal filtration efficiency and ease of breathing with minimal leak- age. Because this mask provides greater comfort compared to commercial alternatives, it is likely to promote greater mask wearing tolerance and acceptance.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION.Prevention measures are highly important to poor communities because surveillance and access to health care may be limited.OBJECTIVES We aimed establish measures to contain and suppress the spread of COVID-19, associating education, active case tracking, and humanitarian aid in two needy communities in Brazil. The adherence to the measures and evolution of the number of cases were verified during the project.MATERIALS AND METHODS.The target population consisted of approximately 1300 participants(350 families). A collection of epidemiological data was performed in family members registered for the project. Rapid tests were performed on people who had symptoms and their contacts. Scientific information through audio-visual materials,educational pamphlets written in colloquial language, food parcels,masks,hygiene and cleaning materials were provided directly to family nuclei. RESULTS The common needs faced by families were food inputs and/or ready-to-eat food, mentioned by 91.4% (233) of the people, and hygienic and cleaning materials, mentioned by 30.6% (78) of the people. Only 34.9% (84) of families had 70% rubbing alcohol or hand sanitizer gel at home.The most frequently cited sources of information on COVID-19 were television [cited by 82.4% (210) of the people]; social media [25.5% (65)]; friends, neighbours, or family members [13.7% (35)]; and radio [11.4% (29)] .A total of 83.7% (175) stated that the actions helped them to avoid leaving the community.CONCLUSIONS Community isolation may be the best way to contain the spread of pandemics in fragile populations with low socio-economic status.Educational actions combined with rapid testing and humanitarian aid were objective forms to promote community isolation.",

    "abstract": "Background With shortages of face-masks continuing to be reported worldwide, critical questions like whether or not there is an adequate alternative to commercially manufactured face-masks continue to linger especially in low- and middle- income settings. This study aimed at addressing this through testing and comparing various materials and forms of face-masks for filtration efficiency, breathability, microbial cleanliness, distance-dependent fitness, and re-usability of different face-masks procured from face-mask vendors in Kampala, Uganda. Methods This was a laboratory-based descriptive study that applied new protocols and already existing protocols with substantive modifications to ten different types of face-mask types each in quadruplicate to achieve each specified aim. Results Surgical face-masks had better filtration efficiency, distance-dependent fitness and breathability compared to other face-masks tested. Decontamination of these face-masks with 70% ethanol negatively affected their efficacy. Locally-made double layered face-masks had better: filtration efficiency, distance-dependent fitness and breathability compared to other locally-made cloth face-masks, and re-usability compared to all the face-mask types that had been tested. Discussion/conclusions Locally-made double layered cloth face-masks could serve as alternative face-masks especially for populations in low- and middle- income settings like Uganda while allowing restricted use of surgical face-masks and other respirators like the KN95 to high-risk groups only.",

    "abstract": "This study sought to provide an early description of mental health service activity before and after national implementation of social distancing for COVID-19. A time series analysis was carried out of daily service-level activity on data from a large mental healthcare provider in southeast London, from 01.02.2020 to 31.03.2020, comparing activity before and after 16.03.2020: i) inpatient admissions, discharges and numbers, ii) contact numbers and daily caseloads (Liaison, Home Treatment Teams, Community Mental Health Teams); iii) numbers of deaths for past and present patients. Daily face-to-face contact numbers fell for liaison, home treatment and community services with incomplete compensatory rises in non-face-to-face contacts. Daily caseloads fell for all services, apart from working age and child/adolescent community teams. Inpatient numbers fell 13.6% after 16th March, and daily numbers of deaths increased by 61.8%.",

    "abstract": "Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, daily counts of confirmed cases and deaths have been publicly reported in real-time to control the virus spread. However, substantial undocumented infections have obscured the true prevalence of the virus. A machine learning framework was developed to estimate time courses of actual new COVID-19 cases and current infections in 50 countries and 50 U.S. states from reported test results and deaths, as well as published epidemiological parameters. Severe under-reporting of cases was found to be universal. Our framework projects for countries like Belgium, Brazil, and the U.S. ~10% of the population has been once infected. In the U.S. states like Louisiana, Georgia, and Florida, more than 4% of the population is estimated to be currently infected, as of September 3, 2020, while in New York the fraction is 0.12%. The estimation of the actual fraction of currently infected people is crucial for any definition of public health policies, which up to this point may have been misguided by the reliance on confirmed cases.",

    "abstract": "The subset of patients who develop critical illness in Covid-19 have extensive inflammation affecting the lungs[PMID: 32526193] and are strikingly different from other patients: immunosuppressive therapy benefits critically-ill patients, but may harm some non-critical cases.[PMID: 32678530] Since susceptibility to life-threatening infections and immune-mediated diseases are both strongly heritable traits, we reasoned that host genetic variation may identify mechanistic targets for therapeutic development in Covid-19.[PMID: 24855243] GenOMICC (Genetics Of Mortality In Critical Care, <a href=\"https://genomicc.org\">genomicc.org</a>) is a global collaborative study to understand the genetic basis of critical illness. Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 2244 critically-ill Covid-19 patients from 208 UK intensive care units (ICUs), representing >95% of all ICU beds. Ancestry-matched controls were drawn from the UK Biobank population study and results were confirmed in GWAS comparisons with two other population control groups: the 100,000 genomes project and Generation Scotland. We identify and replicate three novel genome-wide significant associations, at chr19p13.3 (rs2109069, p = 3.98 x 10-12), within the gene encoding dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9), at chr12q24.13 (rs10735079, p = 1.65 x 10-8) in a gene cluster encoding antiviral restriction enzyme activators (OAS1, OAS2, OAS3), and at chr21q22.1 (rs2236757, p = 4.99 x 10-8) in the interferon receptor gene IFNAR2. Consistent with our focus on extreme disease in younger patients with less comorbidity, we detect a stronger signal at the known 3p21.31 locus than previous studies (rs73064425, p = 4.77 x 10-30).",

    "abstract": "Background: India has recorded 66,333 deaths over 36 administrative regions placing India third in the world after the US and Brazil for COVID-19 deaths as of 2 September 2020. Studies indicate that south-west monsoon season plays a role in the dynamics of contagious diseases, which tend to peak post-monsoon season. Recent studies show that vitamin D and its primary source Ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB) may play a protective role in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. However, the combined roles of the monsoon season and UVB in COVID-19 in India are still unclear. In this observational study, we empirically study the respective roles of monsoon season and UVB, whilst further exploring, whether monsoon season negatively impacts the protective role of UVB in COVID-19 deaths in India. Methods: We use a log-linear Mundlak model to a panel dataset of 36 administrative regions in India from 14 March 2020 - 8 August 2020 (n=4005). We use the cumulative COVID-19 deaths as the dependent variable. We isolate the association of monsoon season and UVB as measured by Ultraviolet Index (UVI) from other confounding time-constant and time-varying region-specific factors. Findings: After controlling for various confounding factors, we observe that the monsoon season and a unit increase in UVI are separately associated with 12.8 percentage points and 2.0 percentage points decline in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths in the long run. These associations translate into substantial relative changes. For example, the current monsoon season, that has been going on for two weeks, is associated with a reduction in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths of 59%, whereas a permanent unit increase of UVI is associated with a reduction in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths of 37%. However, the current monsoon season, also reduces the protective role of UVI by 16.3% [0.33 percentage points], plausibly due to lower UVB exposure. Interpretation: We find independent protective roles of both the monsoon season and UVI in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. Furthermore, we find evidence that monsoon season is associated with a significant reduction in the protective role of UVI. The protective role of monsoon season is plausibly due to limited outdoor activities of people. Our study outlines the role of the monsoon season and UVB in COVID-19 in India and supports health-related policy decision making in India.",

    "abstract": "Background and aims: This study investigated the clinical manifestations, outcomes and long-term complications of COVID-19 inpatients in Bangladesh while emphasizing on individuals having diabetes. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted for a sample of COVID-19 inpatients across four different hospitals of Bangladesh between April 1st and June 30, 2020. Variation in clinical characteristics, contact history, comorbidities, treatment pattern, and long-term complications were investigated. Results: There were 734 COVID-19 presentations in this study of which 19.8% of patients had diabetes. 76% were male and 85% of the patients had been administered with all vaccine doses during childhood. The most frequently occurring blood groups among patients with diabetes were B (+) ve (35%) and O (+) ve (31%). Among biochemical parameters, glucose, D-dimer, C- reactive protein (CRP) and Troponin levels were significantly elevated amidst the cohort with diabetes. The frequency of insulin dependent individuals increased three-fold during COVID-19. A number of COVID-19 patients with diabetes have been suffering from long term complications post recovery including pain, discomfort, memory loss and sleep disturbance. Conclusion: Individuals with diabetes have experienced severe manifestation of COVID-19 and post disease complications. Further in-depth studies focused on larger sample sizes are entailed to assess the relationships elaborately.",

    "abstract": "We are currently facing a pandemic of COVID-19, caused by a spillover from an animal-originating coronavirus to humans occuring in the Wuhan region, China, in December 2019. From China the virus has spread to 188 countries and regions worldwide, reaching the Sahel region on the 2nd of March 2020. Since whole genome sequencing (WGS) data is very crucial to understand the spreading dynamics of the ongoing pandemic, but only limited sequence data is available from the Sahel region to date, we have focused our efforts on generating the first Malian sequencing data available. Screening of 217 Malian patient samples for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in 38 positive isolates from which 21 whole genome sequences were generated. Our analysis shows that both, the early A (19B) and the fast evolving B (20A/C) clade, are present in Mali indicating multiple and independent introductions of the SARS-CoV-2 to the Sahel region.",

    "abstract": "Background: Qatar experienced a large severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic that disproportionately affected the craft and manual workers (CMWs) who constitute 60% of the population. This study aimed to investigate level of immunity in communities within this population as well as infection exposure required to achieve herd immunity. Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was assessed in ten CMW communities between June 21 and September 9, 2020. PCR positivity, infection positivity (antibody and/or PCR positive), and infection severity rate were also estimated. Associations with anti-SARS-CoV-2 positivity were investigated using regression analyses. Results: Study included 4,970 CMWs who were mostly men (95.0%) and <40 years of age (71.5%). Seropositivity ranged from 54.9% (95% CI: 50.2-59.4%) to 83.8% (95% CI: 79.1-87.7%) in the different CMW communities. Pooled mean seropositivity across all communities was 66.1% (95% CI: 61.5-70.6%). PCR positivity ranged from 0.0% to 10.5% (95% CI: 7.4-14.8%) in the different CMW communities. Pooled mean PCR positivity was 3.9% (95% CI: 1.6-6.9%). Median cycle threshold (Ct) value was 34.0 (range: 15.8-37.4). The majority (79.5%) of PCR-positive individuals had Ct value >30 indicative of earlier rather than recent infection. Infection positivity (antibody and/or PCR positive) ranged from 62.5% (95% CI: 58.3-66.7%) to 83.8% (95% CI: 79.1-87.7%) in the different CMW communities. Pooled mean infection positivity was 69.5% (95% CI: 62.8-75.9%). Only five infections were ever severe and one was ever critical, an infection severity rate of 0.2% (95% CI: 0.1-0.4%). Conclusions: Based on an extended range of epidemiological measures, active infection is rare in these communities with limited if any sustainable infection transmission for clusters to occur. At least some CMW communities in Qatar have reached or nearly reached herd immunity for SARS-CoV-2 infection at a proportion of ever infection of 65-70%.",

    "abstract": "The numbers of confirmed cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are increasing in many places. Consequently, the number of individuals placed into quarantine is increasing too. The large number of individuals in quarantine has high societal and economical costs. There is ongoing debate about the duration of quarantine, particularly since the fraction of individuals in quarantine who eventually test positive is perceived as being low. We present a mathematical model that uses empirically determined distributions of incubation period, infectivity, and generation time to quantify how the duration of quarantine affects transmission. We use this model to examine two quarantine scenarios: traced contacts of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and returning travellers. We quantify the impact of shortening the quarantine duration in terms of prevented transmission and the ratio of prevented transmission to days spent in quarantine. We also consider the impact of i) test-and-release strategies; ii) reinforced hygiene measures upon release after a negative test; iii) the development of symptoms during quarantine; iv) the relationship between quarantine duration and adherence; and v) the fraction of individuals in quarantine that are infected. When considering the ratio of prevented transmission to days spent in quarantine, we find that the diminishing impact of longer quarantine on transmission prevention may support a quarantine duration below 10 days. This ratio can be increased by implementing a test-and-release strategy, and this can be even further strengthened by reinforced hygiene measures post-release. We also find that unless a test-and-release strategy is considered, the fraction of individuals in quarantine that are infected does not affect the optimal duration of quarantine under our utility metric. Ultimately, we show that there are quarantine strategies based on a test-and-release protocol that, from an epidemiological viewpoint, perform almost as well as the standard 10 day quarantine, but with a lower cost in terms of person days spent in quarantine. This applies to both travellers and contacts, but the specifics depend on the context.",

    "abstract": "The mortality figures related to the coronavirus pandemic has been the topic of debate lately. Several hypothesis are made regarding the expected number of deaths in a region but there are various factors governing the same. In this paper, we have discussed the mortality figures in the Umbria region after analyzing the data from the national Health registry between December 2019 to April 2020; the period of infection and its comparison with the data from previous five years. The factors governing these figures were studied including temperature, standard mortality rates, territorial distribution, death due to all cases as well as the non-COVID deaths. A sharp increase in mortality figures was observed for the month of march and low temperature also had a role to play. However the difference when compared to previous 5 years was not significant as was expected at the start of the study. A single factor cannot be responsible for the total mortality figures in a region as is frequently predicted.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To assess health equity-oriented COVID-19 data reporting across Canadian provinces and territories, using a scorecard approach. Method: A scan was performed of provincial and territorial reporting of five data elements (cumulative totals of tests, cases, hospitalizations, deaths and population size) across three units of aggregation (province or territory-level, health regions, and local areas) (15 \"overall\" indicators), and for two vulnerable settings (long term care and detention facilities) and six social markers (age, sex, immigration status, race/ethnicity, essential worker status, and income) (120 \"equity-related\" indicators). Per indicator, one point was awarded if case-delimited data were released, 0.7 points if only summary statistics were reported, and 0 if neither was provided. Results were presented using a scorecard approach. Results: Overall, information on cases and deaths was more complete than for tests, hospitalizations and population size denominators needed for rate estimation. Information provided on jurisdictions and their regions, overall, tended to be more available (average score of 53%, \"B\") than for equity-related indicators (average score of 21%, \"D\"). Only British Columbia and Alberta provided case-delimited data, and only Alberta provided information for local areas. No jurisdiction reported on outcomes according to patients' individual-level immigration status, race, or income. Only Ontario and Quebec provided detailed information for long-term care settings and detention facilities. Conclusion: Socially stratified reporting for COVID-19 outcomes is sparse in Canada. However, several best practices in health equity-oriented reporting were observed and set a relevant precedent for all jurisdictions to follow for this pandemic and future ones.",

    "abstract": "Background: Brazil became the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic in a brief period of a few months after the first officially registered case. The knowledge of the epidemiological/clinical profile and the risk factors of Brazilian COVID-19 patients can assist in the decision making of physicians in the implementation of early and most appropriate measures for poor prognosis patients. However, these reports are missing. Here we present a comprehensive study that addresses this demand. Methods: This data-driven study was based on the Brazilian Ministry of Health Database (SIVEP-Gripe, 2020) regarding notified cases of hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the period from February 26 to August 10, 2020. Demographic data, clinical symptoms, comorbidities and other additional information of patients were analyzed. Results: The hospitalization rate was higher for male gender (56.56%) and for older age patients of both sexes. Overall, the mortality rate was quite high (41.28%) among hospitalized patients, especially those over 60 years of age. Most prevalent symptoms were cough, dyspnoea, fever, low oxygen saturation and respiratory distress. Heart disease, diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, neurological disease, and pneumopathy were the most prevalent comorbidities. A high prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with heart disease (65.7%) and diabetes (53.55%) and with a high mortality rate of around 50% was observed. The ICU admission rate was 39.37% and of these 62.4% died. 24.4% of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), with high mortality among them (82.98%). The main mortality risk predictors were older age and IMV requirement. In addition, socioeconomic conditions have been shown to significantly influence the disease outcome, regardless of age and comorbidities. Conclusion: Our study provides a comprehensive overview of the hospitalized Brazilian COVID-19 patients profile and the mortality risk factors. The analysis also evidenced that the disease outcome is influenced by multiple factors, as unequally affects different segments of population.",

    "abstract": "Background: COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on ethnic minority populations, both in the UK and internationally. To date, much of the evidence has been derived from studies within single healthcare settings, mainly those hospitalised with COVID-19. Working on behalf of NHS England, the aim of this study was to identify ethnic differences in the risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation and mortality using a large general population cohort in England. Methods: We conducted an observational cohort study using linked primary care records of 17.5 million adults between 1 February 2020 and 3 August 2020. Exposure was self-reported ethnicity collapsed into the 5 and 16 ethnicity categories of the English Census. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify ethnic differences in the risk of being tested and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 related intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and COVID-19 mortality, adjusted for socio-demographic factors, clinical co-morbidities, geographic region, care home residency, and household size. Results: A total of 17,510,002 adults were included in the study; 63% white (n=11,030,673), 6% south Asian (n=1,034,337), 2% black (n=344,889), 2% other (n=324,730), 1% mixed (n=172,551), and 26% unknown (n=4,602,822). After adjusting for measured explanatory factors, south Asian, black, and mixed groups were marginally more likely to be tested (south Asian HR 1.08, 95%CI 1.07-1.09; black HR 1.08; 95%CI 1.06-1.09, mixed HR 1.03, 95%CI 1.01-1.05), and substantially more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with white adults (south Asian HR 2.02. 95% CI 1.97-2.07; black HR 1.68, 95%CI 1.61-1.76; mixed HR 1.46, 95%CI 1.36-1.56). The risk of being admitted to ICU for COVID-19 was substantially increased in all ethnic minority groups compared with white adults (south Asian HR 2.22, 95%CI 1.96-2.52; black HR 3.07, 95%CI 2.61-3.61; mixed HR 2.86, 95%CI 2.19-3.75, other HR 2.86, 95%CI 2.31-3.63). Risk of COVID-19 mortality was increased by 25-56% in ethnic minority groups compared with white adults (south Asian HR 1.27, 95%CI 1.17-1.38; black HR 1.55, 95%CI 1.38-1.75; mixed HR 1.40, 95%CI 1.12-1.76; other HR 1.25, 95%CI 1.05-1.49). We observed heterogeneity of associations after disaggregation into detailed ethnic groupings; Indian and African groups were at higher risk of all outcomes; Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Caribbean groups were less or equally likely to be tested for SARS-CoV-2, but at higher risk of all other outcomes, Chinese groups were less likely to be tested for and test positive for SARS-CoV-2, more likely to be admitted to ICU, and equally likely to die from COVID-19. Conclusions: We found evidence of substantial ethnic inequalities in the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, ICU admission, and mortality, which persisted after accounting for explanatory factors, including household size. It is likely that some of this excess risk is related to factors not captured in clinical records such as occupation, experiences of structural discrimination, or inequitable access to health and social services. Prioritizing linkage between health, social care, and employment data and engaging with ethnic minority communities to better understand their lived experiences is essential for generating evidence to prevent further widening of inequalities in a timely and actionable manner.",

    "abstract": "Many countries have implemented strict social distancing measures in the hope of reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 but the effectiveness of these measures is determined by the willingness of populations to comply with restrictions. Consequently, a system of monitoring population movement using existing data sources can inform those making decisions about policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe a collaboration with all 3 major domestic telecommunication companies in Hungary to use aggregated anonymous mobile phone usage data to calculate two indices for assessing the effect of movement restrictions: a \"mobility-index\" and a \"stay-at-home (or resting) index\". The strengths and weaknesses of this approach are compared with the smartphone-based, COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports from Google. Data generated by mobile phones have long been identified as a potential means to analyse mass population movement, but its operationalisation raises several technical questions, such as making sense of Call Detail Records, collation of data from different mobile network providers, and personal data protection concerns. The method described here addresses these issues and offers an effective and inexpensive tool to monitor the impact of social distancing measures, achieving high levels of accuracy and resolution. Especially in populations where uptake of smartphones is modest, this method has certain advantages over app-based solutions, with greater population coverage, but it is not an alternative to smartphone-based solutions used for contact tracing and quarantine monitoring. We believe that this method can easily be adapted by other countries.",

    "abstract": "During early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, forecasts provided actionable information about disease transmission to public health decision-makers. Between February and May 2020, experts in infectious disease modeling made weekly predictions about the impact of the pandemic in the U.S. We aggregated these predictions into consensus predictions. In March and April 2020, experts predicted that the number of COVID-19 related deaths in the U.S. by the end of 2020 would be in the range of 150,000 to 250,000, with scenarios of near 1m deaths considered plausible. The wide range of possible future outcomes underscored the uncertainty surrounding the outbreak's trajectory. Experts' predictions of measurable short-term outcomes had varying levels of accuracy over the surveys but showed appropriate levels of uncertainty when aggregated. An expert consensus model can provide important insight early on in an emerging global catastrophe.",

    "abstract": "Background Children are relatively protected from novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19). The reasons for this protection are not well understood but differences in the immune response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been implicated. If such differences are due to differential exposure to non-SARS-CoV-2 infectious agents, adults who are close contacts of children may partly share in this protection. Such a protective effect would have important implications for the lives of children, not least in terms of schooling. Methods Using a Scotland-wide record-linkage based occupational cohort comprising healthcare workers and members of their households, we examined whether sharing a household with young children (aged 0 to 11) attenuated the risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19, and/or testing positive for COVID-19 infection of any severity (any case of Covid-19). All healthcare workers directly employed by the National health Service (NHS) in Scotland, or contracted to provide general practice services, were included. Outcome and covariate data were obtained via linkage to Scotland-wide microbiology, drug prescribing, hospitalisation and death data. Results 241,266 adults did not share a household with young children; 41,198, 23,783 and 3,850 shared a household with 1, 2 and 3 or more young children respectively. The risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19 was lower in those with one child and lower still in those with two or more children, adjusting for age the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.83 per child (95% CI 0.70-0.99). On additionally adjusting for sex, socioeconomic deprivation, occupation, professional role, staff/non-staff status, the number of adults and adolescents in each household, and comorbidity, the HR was 0.89 per child (95% CI 0.74-1.06). An association of the same magnitude, but more precisely estimated, was obtained for any case of COVID-19 (fully adjusted model, HR per child 0.89; 95% CI 0.84-0.95). Conclusion Increased household exposure to young children was associated with an attenuated risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and appeared to also be associated with an attenuated risk of COVID-19 disease severe enough to require hospitalisation.",

    "abstract": "Background: The COVID 19 pandemic was associated with social restrictions in the UK from 16th March 2020. It was unclear if the lockdown period was associated with differences in the case-mix of non-COVID acute medical admissions compared with the previous year. Methods: Retrospective data were collected for 1st to 30th April 2019 and 1st to 30th April 2020 from University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, one of the largest hospitals in the UK with over 2 million patient contacts per year. The latter time period was chosen to coincide with the peak of COVID-19 cases in the West Midlands. All patients admitted under acute medicine during these time periods were included. COVID-19 was confirmed by SARS-Cov-2 swab or a probable case of COVID-19 based on World Health Organization diagnostic parameters. Non-COVID patients were those with a negative SARS-Cov-2 swab and no suspicion of COVID-19. Data was sourced from the UHB in-house electronic health system (EHS). Results: The total number of acute medical admissions fell comparing April 2019 (n=2409) to April 2020 (n=1682). As a proportion of total admissions, those aged under 45 years decreased, while those aged 46 and over did not change. The number of admissions due to psychiatric conditions and overdoses was higher in April 2020 (p < 0.001). When viewed as a proportion of admissions, alcohol-related admissions (p = 0.004), psychiatric conditions and overdoses (p<0.001) increased in April 2020 than in April 2019. The proportion of patients who were in hospital due to falls also increased in April 2020 (p<0.001). In the same period, the absolute number and the proportion of admissions that were due to non-specific chest pain, to musculoskeletal complaints and patients who self-discharged prior to assessment decreased (p=0.02, p=0.01 and p = 0.002 respectively). There were no significant differences in non-COVID-related intensive care admissions or mortality between the same months in the two years. Conclusion: In this large, single-centre study, there was a change in hospitalised case-mix when comparing April 2019 with April 2020: an increase in conditions which potentially reflect social isolation (falls, drug and alcohol misuse and psychiatric illness) and a decrease in conditions which rarely require in-patient hospital treatment (musculoskeletal pain and non-cardiac chest pain) especially among younger adults. These results highlight two areas for further research; the impact of social isolation on health and whether younger adults could be offered alternative health services to avoid potentially unnecessary hospital assessment.",

    "abstract": "Background: Access to health services and adequate care is influenced by sex, ethnicity, socio-economic position (SEP) and burden of co-morbidities. However, it is unknown whether the COVID-19 pandemic further deepened these already existing health inequalities. Methods: Participants were from five longitudinal age-homogenous British cohorts (born in 2001, 1990, 1970, 1958 and 1946). A web and telephone-based survey provided data on cancelled surgical or medical appointments, and the number of care hours received during the UK COVID-19 national lockdown. Using binary or ordered logistic regression, we evaluated whether these outcomes differed by sex, ethnicity, SEP and having a chronic illness. Adjustment was made for study-design, non-response weights, psychological distress, presence of children or adolescents in the household, keyworker status, and whether participants had received a shielding letter. Meta-analyses were performed across the cohorts and meta-regression evaluated the effect of age as a moderator. Findings: 14891 participants were included. Females (OR 1.40, 95% confidence interval [1.27,1.55]) and those with a chronic illness (OR 1.84 [1.65-2.05]) experienced significantly more cancellations during lockdown (all p<0.0001). Ethnic minorities and those with a chronic illness required a higher number of care hours during the lockdown (both OR approx. 2.00, all p<0.002). Age was not independently associated with either outcome in meta-regression. SEP was not associated with cancellation or care hours. Interpretation: The UK government's lockdown approach during the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have deepened existing health inequalities, impacting predominantly females, ethnic-minorities and those with chronic illnesses. Public health authorities need to implement urgent policies to ensure equitable access to health and care for all in preparation for a second wave.",

Furthermore, sex differences characterize the frequency and severity of pharmacological side effects. A large number of clinical trials are ongoing to develop new therapeutic approaches and vaccines for COVID-19. We investigated the inclusion of sex and/or gender in currently registered studies on ClinicalTrials.gov. Only 416 (16.7%) of the 2,484 registered SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 trials mention sex/gender as recruitment criterion and only 103 (4.1%) allude to sex/gender in the description of the analysis phase. None of the 11 clinical trials published in scientific journals on June 2020 reported sex-disaggregated results. Hence, lack of consideration upon registration does not seem to be corrected during trial execution and reporting. Given the biological relevance and the potential risks of unwanted side effects, we urge researchers to focus on sex-disaggregated analyses already at the planning stage of COVID-19 trials.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 ravage the world with wide variations in morbidity and mortality that have remained largely unexplained, even by mutations in protein coding regions. In this study, we analyzed available complete SARS-CoV-2 sequences using the CpG index as a signature of Zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) activity to examine population variations in innate intracellular antiviral competencies. The result suggests that differential ZAP activity may be a major determinant of the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Africa, Asia, and pools of asymptomatic patients had I_CpG signature evidence of high ZAP activity, while SARS-CoV-2 sequences from North America and Intensive Care Unit or Deceased patients had I_CpG signature of low ZAP activity. ZAP activity is linked to the interferon system. Low ZAP activity may be part of the explanation for the increased morbidity of SARS-CoV-2 in the elderly and with comorbidities like diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. It may also provide some insight into the discrepancies between invitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities of candidate therapies and performance in clinical trials. Furthermore, our results suggest that asymptomatic patients may paradoxically shed a more dangerous virus.",

    "abstract": "The lockdown and social distancing policy imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have a widespread impact on mental healthcare for both services themselves and the people accessing those services. Previous reports from the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in South London) highlighted a shift to virtual contacts among those accessing community mental health and home treatment teams and an increase in deaths over the pandemic first wave. However, there is a need to understand this further for specific groups, including those diagnosed with a personality disorder who might have particular vulnerabilities. Taking advantage of the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource with 24-hourly updates of electronic mental health records data, this paper describes daily caseloads and contact numbers (face-to-face and virtual) for individuals with personality disorders across community, specialist, crisis and inpatient services. The report focussed on the period 1st January to 31st May 2020. We also report on daily accepted and discharged trust referrals, total trust caseloads and daily inpatient admissions and discharges for individuals with personality disorders. In addition, daily deaths are described for all current and previous SLaM service users with personality disorder over this period. In summary, comparing periods before and after 16th March 2020 there was a shift from face-to-face contacts to virtual contacts across all teams. Liaison and Older Adult teams showed the largest drop in caseloads, whereas Early Intervention in Psychosis service caseloads remained the same. Reduced accepted referrals and inpatient admissions were observed and there was a 28% increase in average daily deaths in the period after 16th March, compared to the period 1st January to 15th March.",

    "abstract": "Background: Emerging evidence suggests that socially vulnerable communities are at higher risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks in the United States. However, no prior studies have examined temporal trends and differential effects of social vulnerability on COVID-19 incidence and death rates. The purpose of this study was to examine temporal trends among counties with high and low social vulnerability and to quantify disparities in these trends over time. We hypothesized that highly vulnerable counties would have higher incidence and death rates compared to less vulnerable counties and that this disparity would widen as the pandemic progressed. Methods: We conducted a retrospective longitudinal analysis examining COVID-19 incidence and death rates from March 1 to August 31, 2020 for each county in the US. We obtained daily COVID-19 incident case and death data from USAFacts and the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering. We classified counties using the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a percentile-based measure from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in which higher scores represent more vulnerability. Using a Bayesian hierarchical negative binomial model, we estimated daily risk ratios (RRs) comparing counties in the first (lower) and fourth (upper) SVI quartiles. We adjusted for percentage of the county designated as rural, percentage in poor or fair health, percentage of adult smokers, county average daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5), percentage of primary care physicians per 100,000 residents, and the proportion tested for COVID-19 in the state. Results: In unadjusted analyses, we found that for most of March 2020, counties in the upper SVI quartile had significantly fewer cases per 100,000 than lower SVI quartile counties. However, on March 30, we observed a crossover effect in which the RR became significantly greater than 1.00 (RR = 1.10, 95% PI: 1.03, 1.18), indicating that the most vulnerable counties had, on average, higher COVID-19 incidence rates compared to least vulnerable counties. Upper SVI quartile counties had higher death rates on average starting on March 30 (RR = 1.17, 95% PI: 1.01,1.36). The death rate RR achieved a maximum value on July 29 (RR = 3.22, 95% PI: 2.91, 3.58), indicating that most vulnerable counties had, on average, 3.22 times more deaths per million than the least vulnerable counties. However, by late August, the lower quartile started to catch up to the upper quartile. In adjusted models, the RRs were attenuated for both incidence cases and deaths, indicating that the adjustment variables partially explained the associations. We also found positive associations between COVID-19 cases and deaths and percentage of the county designated as rural, percentage of resident in fair or poor health, and average daily PM2.5. Conclusions: Results indicate that the impact of COVID-19 is not static but can migrate from less vulnerable counties to more vulnerable counties over time. This highlights the importance of protecting vulnerable populations as the pandemic unfolds.",

    "abstract": "Aim: We aimed to estimate the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks in a case study COVID-free destination country, associated with shore leave for merchant ship crews. Methods: A stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1, designed specifically for COVID-19 was utilised. It was populated with parameters for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, shipping characteristics, and plausible control measures. Results: When no control interventions were in place, an outbreak of COVID-19 in our case study destination country (New Zealand; NZ) was estimated to occur after a median time of 23 days (assuming a global average for source country incidence of 2.66 new infections per 1000 population per week, a crew of 20, a voyage length of 10 days, 1 day of shore leave both in NZ and abroad, and 108 port visits by international merchant ships per week). For this example the uncertainty around when outbreaks occur is wide (an outbreak occurs with 95% probability between 1 and 124 days). The combined use of a PCR test on arrival, self-reporting of symptoms with contact tracing, and mask use during shore leave, increased this median time to 1.0 year (14 days to 5.4 years). Scenario analyses found that onboard infection chains could persist for well over 4 weeks even with crews of only 5 members. Conclusion: Introduction of SARS-CoV-2 through shore leave from international shipping crews is likely, even after long voyages. The risk can be substantially mitigated by control measures such as PCR testing and mask use.",

Swabs for the most recent two rounds were taken between 24th July and 11th August and for round 4 between 22nd August and 7th September. We estimate weighted overall prevalence, doubling times between and within rounds and associated reproduction numbers. We obtained unweighted prevalence estimates by sub-groups: age, sex, region, ethnicity, key worker status, household size, for which we also estimated odds of infection. We identified clusters of swab-positive participants who were closer, on average, to other swab-positive participants than would be expected. Findings Over all four rounds of the study, we found that 72% (67%, 76%) of swab-positive individuals were asymptomatic at the time of swab and in the week prior. The epidemic declined between rounds 1 and 2, and rounds 2 and 3. However, the epidemic was increasing between rounds 3 and 4, with a doubling time of 17 (13, 23) days corresponding to an R value of 1.3 (1.2, 1.4). When analysing round 3 alone, we found that the epidemic had started to grow again with 93% probability. Using only the most recent round 4 data, we estimated a doubling time of 7.7 (5.5, 12.7) days, corresponding to an R value of 1.7 (1.4, 2.0). Cycle threshold values were lower (viral loads were higher) for rounds 1 and 4 than they were for rounds 2 and 3. In round 4, we observed the highest prevalence in participants aged 18 to 24 years at 0.25% (0.16%, 0.41%), increasing from 0.08% (0.04%, 0.18%) in round 3. We observed the lowest prevalence in those aged 65 and older at 0.04% (0.02%, 0.06%) which was stable compared with round 3. Participants of Asian ethnicity had elevated odds of infection. We identified clusters in and around London, transient clusters in the Midlands, and an expanding area of clustering in the North West and more recently in Yorkshire and the Humber. Interpretation Although low levels of transmission persisted in England through to mid-summer 2020, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is now increasing. We found evidence of accelerating transmission at the end of August and beginning of September. Representative community antigen sampling can increase situational awareness and help improve public health decision making even at low prevalence.",

    "abstract": "Background. Hydroxychloroquine has been shown to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, but early clinical studies found no benefit treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We set out to evaluate the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for prevention, as opposed to treatment, of COVID-19 mortality. Methods. We pre-specified and conducted an observational, population-based cohort study using national primary care data and linked death registrations in the OpenSAFELY platform, representing 40% of the general population in England. We used Cox regression to estimate the association between ongoing routine hydroxychloroquine use prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in England and risk of COVID-19 mortality among people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Model adjustment was informed by a directed acyclic graph. Findings. Of 194,637 patients with RA or SLE, 30,569 (15.7%) received [&ge;]2 prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine in the six months prior to 1 March 2020. Between 1 March 2020 and 13 July 2020, there were 547 COVID-19 deaths, 70 among hydroxychloroquine users. Estimated standardised cumulative COVID-19 mortality was 0.23% (95% CI 0.18-0.29) among users and 0.22% (95% CI 0.20-0.25) among non-users; an absolute difference of 0.008% (95% CI -0.051-0.066). After accounting for age, sex, ethnicity, use of other immunuosuppressives, and geographic region, no association with COVID-19 mortality was observed (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.80-1.33). We found no evidence of interactions with age or other immunosuppressives. Quantitative bias analyses indicated observed associations were robust to missing information regarding additional biologic treatments for rheumatological disease. We observed similar associations with the negative control outcome of non-COVID-19 mortality. Interpretation. We found no evidence of a difference in COVID-19 mortality among patients who received hydroxychloroquine for treatment of rheumatological disease prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in England.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a new RNA virus affecting humans and spreads extensively through world populations since its first outbreak in late December, 2019. Whether the transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 is actively evolving, and driven by adaptation to the new host and environments is still unknown. Understanding the evolutionary mechanism underlying epidemiological and pathological characteristics of COVID-19 is essential for predicting the epidemic trend, and providing guidance for disease control and treatments. Interrogating 22,078 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences of 84 countries, we demonstrate with convincing evidence that (i) SARS-CoV-2 genomes are overall conserved under purifying selection. (ii) Ongoing positive selection is actively driving the evolution of specific genes. Notably, genes related to coronavirus infection and host immune system defense are under adaptive evolution while genes related to viral RNA replication, transcription and translation are under purifying selection. A spatial and temporal landscape of 54 critical mutants is constructed based on their divergence among viral haplotype clusters, of which multiple mutants potentially conferring viral transmissibility, infectivity and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 are highlighted.",

    "abstract": "Controlling the regional re-emergence of SARS-CoV-2 after its initial spread in ever-changing personal contact networks and disease landscapes is a challenging task. In a landscape context, contact opportunities within and between populations are changing rapidly as lockdown measures are relaxed and a number of social activities re-activated. Using an individual-based metapopulation model, we explored the efficacy of different control strategies across an urban-rural gradient in Wales, UK. Our model shows that isolation of symptomatic cases, or regional lockdowns in response to local outbreaks, have limited efficacy unless the overall transmission rate is kept persistently low. Additional isolation of non-symptomatic infected individuals, who may be detected by effective test and trace strategies, is pivotal to reduce the overall epidemic size over a wider range of transmission scenarios. We define an urban-rural gradient in epidemic size as a correlation between regional epidemic size and connectivity within the region, with more highly connected urban populations experiencing relatively larger outbreaks. For interventions focused on regional lockdowns, the strength of such gradients in epidemic size increased with higher travel frequencies, indicating a reduced efficacy of the control measure in the urban regions under these conditions. When both non-symptomatic and symptomatic individuals are isolated or regional lockdown strategies are enforced, we further found the strongest urban-rural epidemic gradients at high transmission rates. This effect was reversed for strategies targeted at symptomatics only. Our results emphasise the importance of test-and-tracing strategies and maintaining low transmission rates for efficiently controlling COVID19 spread, both at landscape scale and in urban areas.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss three different response strategies to a disease outbreak and their economic implications in an age-structured population. We have utilized the classical age structured SIR-model, thus assuming that recovered people will not be infected again. Available resource dynamics is governed by the well-known logistic growth model, in which the reproduction coefficient depends on the disease outbreak spreading dynamics. We further investigate the feedback interaction of the disease spread dynamics and resource growth dynamics with the premise that the quality of treatment depends on the current economic situation. The very inclusion of mortality rates and economic considerations in the same model may be incongruous under certain positions, but in this model, we take a 'realpolitik' approach by exploring all of these factors together as it is done in reality.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: This study investigated the performance and robustness of radiomics in predicting COVID-19 severity in a large public cohort. Methods: A public dataset of 1110 COVID-19 patients (1 CT/patient) was used. Using CTs and clinical data, each patient was classified into mild, moderate, and severe by two observers: (1) dataset provider and (2) a board-certified radiologist. For each CT, 107 radiomic features were extracted. The dataset was randomly divided into a training (60%) and holdout validation (40%) set. During training, features were selected and combined into a logistic regression model for predicting severe cases from mild and moderate cases. The models were trained and validated on the classifications by both observers. AUC quantified the predictive power of models. To determine model robustness, the trained models was cross-validated on the inter-observer classifications. Results: A single feature alone was sufficient to predict mild from severe COVID-19 with AUC_valid^provider=0.85 and AUC_valid^radiologist=0.74 (p<<0.01). The most predictive features were the distribution of small size-zones (GLSZM-SmallAreaEmphasis) for provider classification and linear dependency of neighboring voxels (GLCM-Correlation) for radiologist classification. Cross-validation showed that both AUC_valid^ {approx}0.80 (p<<0.01). In predicting moderate from severe COVID-19, first-order-Median alone had sufficient predictive power of AUC_valid^provider=0.65 (p=0.01). For radiologist classification, the predictive power of the model increased to AUC_valid^radiologist=0.66 (p<<0.01) as the number of features grew from 1 to 5. Cross-validation yielded AUC_valid^radiologist=0.63 (p=0.002) and AUC_valid^provider=0.60 (p=0.09). Conclusions: Radiomics significantly predicted different levels of COVID-19 severity. The prediction was moderately sensitive to inter-observer classifications, and thus need to be used with caution.",

    "abstract": "Background: Bhutan lacks a medical school and all their medical students are trained outside in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and India. When the COVID-19 pandemic let to closure of medical schools in these countries, the Bhutanese medical students were repatriated in March-April 2020. Upon return, they were kept in government-sponsored facility quarantine for 21 days. This study assessed their knowledge on COVID-19 as a part of self-learning and attitude as part of preparedness towards participation in government's health response to COVID-19. Method: This was a cross-sectional study among medical students who had returned to the country. This survey was conducted through an online questionnaire while the students were in 21-day facility quarantine. The sample size calculated was 129 and a convenient sampling was used. Knowledge was assessed using 20 questions, each scored 1/20. Cumulative score of score of >=80% was categorized as \"good knowledge\", score of >=60-79% was considered \"satisfactory knowledge\", and score <60% was considered \"poor knowledge.\" Correlation between knowledge score and duration of clinical clerkship was tested using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Attitude of students towards their willingness to participate in the national COVID-19 response were tested using rating scales. Data were analysed using Stata 13.1. Results: 120 medical students responded to this survey (response rate = 93%). Eighty-eight (74%) had good knowledge, 28 (23%) had satisfactory knowledge and only four (3%) had poor knowledge on COVID-19. The students scored high on the symptomatology, mode of transmission, prevention and treatment options and on local epidemiology; and scored low on the forms of mechanical ventilations and on the home-management of non-critical cases. The knowledge score correlated with duration of clinical clerkship (r = 0.326, p = 0.001). The primary source of information were social media sites (102, 85%), television (94, 78%) and newspapers (76, 63%). The majority (78, 65%) were willing to participate in the government's COVID-19 response but could not identify what roles they could play. The fear of contracting COVID-19 was reported in only in 8.7%. Conclusions: The medical students had good knowledge on COVID-19 and were self-learned through social media, television and newspapers. The students held positive attitude towards participation in the government's COVID-19 response.",

    "abstract": "This work characterizes the NIH contribution to vaccine technologies being employed in \"warp speed\" development of vaccines for COVID-19, as well as the lack of sustained NIH funding for published research against recognized epidemic threats. Using quantitative methods, we examined the advance of published research on ten of the vaccine technologies incorporated in the 165 candidate vaccines entering development through July 2020 as well as the NIH funding that supported this research. Live, attenuated virus, inactivated virus, and adjuvant technologies have been used in successful products since the 1950s and continue to exhibit steady advance. Synthetic (recombinant) vaccines, viral vectors, DNA, and TLR9 agonists as adjuvants emerged since the 1980s, and exhibit a logistic, \"S-curve\" pattern of growth characteristic of emerging technologies that have passed an analytically-defined established point. In contrast, mRNA, virus-like particle, and nanoparticle technologies show exponential growth characteristic of technologies short of their established points. The body of research and NIH funding for established and emerging vaccine technologies exhibited sustained growth through the late 2010s, supported by >16,000 thousand project years of NIH funding totaling over $17.2 billion (2000-2019), the majority through cooperative agreements and intramural programs. NIH funding for published research on vaccines for recognized zoonotic threats including coronavirus, Zika, Ebola, and dengue, however, has been inconsistent and reactive to disease outbreaks. These data are considered in the context of the high failure rate for candidate vaccines and evidence that technological maturity is a significant factor in the efficiency of product development. Sustained funding for both enabling technologies and vaccine development is essential to ensure a rapid response to COVID and future pandemic threats.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Serologic techniques can serve as a complement to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection. The objective of our study was to compare the diagnostic performance of six immunoassays to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2: three lateral flow immunoassays (LFAs), one ELISA and two chemiluminescence assays (CLIAs). Methods: We evaluated three LFAs (Alltest, One Step and SeroFlash), one ELISA (Dia.Pro) and two CLIAs (Elecsys and COV2T). To assess the specificity, 60 pre-pandemic sera were used. To evaluate the sensitivity, we used 80 serum samples from patients with positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Agreement between techniques was evaluated using the kappa score (k). Results: All immunoassays showed a specificity of 100% except for SeroFlash (96.7%). Overall sensitivity was 61.3%, 73.8%, 67.5%, 85.9%, 88.0% and 92.0% for Alltest, One Step, SeroFlash, Dia.Pro, Elecsys and COV2T, respectively. Sensitivity increased throughout the first two weeks from the onset of symptoms, reaching sensitivities over 85% from 14 days for all LFAs, being One Step the most sensitive (97.6%), followed by SeroFlash (95.1%). Dia.Pro, Elecsys and COV2T showed sensitivities over 97% from 14 days, being 100% for COV2T. One Step showed the best agreement results among LFAs, showing excellent agreement with Dia.Pro (agreement=94.2%, k=0.884), COV2T (99.1%, k=0.981) and Elecsys (97.3%, k=0.943). Dia.Pro, COV2T and Elecsys also showed excellent agreement between them. Conclusions: One Step, Dia.Pro, Elecsys and COV2T obtained the best diagnostic performance results. All these techniques showed a specificity of 100% and sensitivities over 97% from 14 days after the onset of symptoms, as well as excellent levels of agreement.",

    "abstract": "Introduction A controversy remains worldwide regarding the transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital settings. We reviewed the current evidence on the air contamination with SARS-CoV-2 in hospital settings, and the factors associated to the contamination including the viral load and the particles size. Methods The MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science databases were systematically interrogated for original English-language articles detailing COVID-19 air contamination in hospital settings between 1 December 2019 and 21 July 2020. This study was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. The positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and culture were described and compared according to the setting, clinical context, air ventilation system, and distance from patient. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in copies per m3 of air were pooled and their distribution were described by hospital areas. Particle sizes and SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in copies or TCID50 per m3 were analysed after categorization of sizes in <1 micrometers, 1-4 micrometers, and >4 micrometers. Results Among 2,034 records identified, 17 articles were included in the review. Overall, 27.5% (68/247) of air sampled from close patients environment were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, without difference according to the setting (ICU: 27/97, 27.8%; non-ICU: 41/150, 27.3%; p=0.93), the distance from patients (<1 meter: 1/64, 1.5%; 1-5 meters: 4/67, 6%; p=0.4). In other areas, the positivity rate was 23.8% (5/21) in toilets, 9.5% (20/221) in clinical areas, 12.4% (15/121) in staff areas, and 34.1% (14/41) in public areas. A total of 78 viral cultures were performed in three studies, and 3 (4%) were positive, all from close patients environment. The median SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations varied from 1.103 copies per m3 (IQR: 0.4.103-9.103) in clinical areas to 9.7.103 (5.1.103-14.3.103) in the air of toilets or bathrooms. The protective equipment removal and patients rooms had high concentrations/titre of SARS-CoV-2 with aerosol size distributions that showed peaks in the <1 micrometers region, and staff offices in the >4 micrometers region. Conclusion In hospital, the air near and away from COVID-19 patients is frequently contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with however, rare proofs of their viability. High viral loads found in toilet/bathrooms, staff and public hallways suggests to carefully consider these areas.",

    "abstract": "Background: Gargling had been reported to have significant roles in the prevention and treatment of respiratory tract infections. The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of regular gargling to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 in the oropharynx and nasopharynx. Methodology: This pilot, open labeled, randomized, parallel study compared the effect of 30 seconds, 3 times/day gargling using 1% povidone-iodine (PVP-I), essential oils and tap water on SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance among COVID-19 patients in a tertiary hospital in Kuala Lumpur. Progress was monitored by day 4,6 and 12 PCR (Ct value), gargling and symptoms diary as well as clinical observations. Results: Five confirmed Stage 1 COVID-19 patients were recruited for each arm. The age range was from 22 to 56 years old. The majority were males. Two respondents had co-morbidities, which were asthma and obesity. Viral clearance was achieved at day 6 in 100%, 80%, 20% and 0% for 1% PVP-I, essential oils, tap water and control group respectively. Analysis of 1% PVP-I group versus control group showed significant p-value for comparison of PCR results on Day 4, Day 6 and Day 12. Conclusions: This preliminary study showed that gargling with 1% PVP-I and essential oils show great potential to be part of the treatment and management of Stage 1 COVID-19. Larger studies are required to ascertain the benefit of gargling for different stages of COVID-19 patients. This study was registered in clinicaltrial.gov (NCT04410159).",

    "abstract": "Background How aberrant fibrinolysis influences the clinical progression of COVID-19 presents a clinicopathological dilemma challenging intensivists. To investigate whether abnormal fibrinolysis is a culprit or protector or both, we associated elevated plasma D-dimer with clinical variables to identify a panoramic view of the derangements of fibrinolysis that contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 based on studies available in the literature. Methods We performed this systematic review based on both meta-analysis and meta-regression to compute the correlation of D-dimer at admission with clinical features of COVID-19 patients in retrospective studies or case series. We searched the databases until Aug 18, 2020, with no limitations by language. The first hits were screened, data extracted, and analyzed in duplicate. We did the random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions (both univariate and multivariate). D-dimer associated clinical variables and potential mechanisms were schematically reasoned and graphed. Findings Our search identified 42 observational, or retrospective, or case series from six countries (n=14,862 patients) with all races and ages from 1 to 98-year-old. The weighted mean difference of D-dimer was 0.97 g/mL (95% CI 0.65, 1.29) between relatively mild (or healthy control) and severely affected groups with significant publication bias. Univariate meta-regression identified 58 of 106 clinical variables were associated with plasma D-dimer levels, including 3 demographics, 5 comorbidies, 22 laboratory tests, 18 organ injury biomarkers, 8 severe complications, and 2 outcomes (discharge and death). Of these, 11 readouts were negatively associated with the level of plasma D-dimer. Further, age and gender were confounding factors for the identified D-dimer associated variables. There were 22 variables independently correlated with the D-dimer level, including respiratory rate, dyspnea plasma K+, glucose, SpO2, BUN, bilirubin, ALT, AST, systolic blood pressure, and CK. We thus propose that \"insufficient hyperfibrinolysis (fibrinolysis is accelerated but unable to prevent adverse clinical impact for clinical deterioration COVID-19)\" as a peculiar mechanism. Interpretation The findings of this meta-analysis- and meta-regression-based systematic review supports elevated D-dimer as an independent predictor for mortality and severe complications. D-dimer-associated clinical variables draw a landscape integrating the aggregate effects of systemically suppressive and locally (i.e., in the lung) hyperactive derangements of fibrinolysis. D-dimer and associated clinical biomarkers and conceptually parameters could be combined for risk stratification, potentially for tracking thrombolytic therapy or alternative interventions.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to analyze factors impacting the Covid-19 epidemic on a macro level, comparing multiple countries across the world and verifying the occurrence at a micro level through cluster analysis. The severity of the epidemic was most strongly related to exposure to ultraviolet light and extrapolated levels of vitamin D and to the health of the population, especially with regards to obesity. We found no county with an obesity level < 8% with a severe epidemic. We also found that countries where the population benefited from sun exposure or vitamin D supplementation and spent time outside fared well. Factors related to increased propagation of the virus included the use of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), population density, poorly aerated gatherings, relative humidity, timely policies of closing clustering places until aeration was improved, and daily amount of ridership on public transportation, especially subways. Population lockdowns, masks, and blood type did not provide much explanatory power. Contact tracing was not analyzed as very few countries applied it for long enough. The excess mortality observed is within the ranges of severe past influenza epidemics of 2016/2017 or 1999/2000 and lower than older severe influenza epidemics of the 1940s or 1970s. We estimated that COVID mortality death counts in European countries is over estimated when taking into account excess mortality further confirming the important role of comorbidities independently of lockdown policy. A few countries observed an under-mortality despite of some deaths counts attributed to COVID-19. Treatments or vaccines should protect the fraction of the population that is not suffering from severe comorbidities. Our study suggested that prevention measures should be directed to improving aeration systems, enhancing diets and exercise, and ensuring adequate levels of vitamin D. Prevention measures and attention should be paid to anxiety resulting from this episode which may be associated with increases in obesity, addictions, vitamin D deficiency, depression, suicide, and hunger ultimately weakening population resiliency.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: The World Health Organisation (WHO) and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend various triage tools to assist decision-making for patients with suspected COVID-19. We aimed to estimate the accuracy of triage tools for predicting severe illness in adults presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected COVID-19 infection. Methods: We undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 70 EDs across the United Kingdom (UK). We collected data from people attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020, and used presenting data to determine the results of assessment with the following triage tools: the WHO algorithm, NEWS2, CURB-65, CRB-65, PMEWS and the swine flu adult hospital pathway (SFAHP). We used 30-day outcome data (death or receipt of respiratory, cardiovascular or renal support) to determine prognostic accuracy for adverse outcome. Results: We analysed data from 20892 adults, of whom 4672 (22.4%) died or received organ support (primary outcome), with 2058 (9.9%) receiving organ support and 2614 (12.5%) dying without organ support (secondary outcomes). C-statistics for the primary outcome were: CURB-65 0.75; CRB-65 0.70; PMEWS 0.77; NEWS2 (score) 0.77; NEWS2 (rule) 0.69; SFAHP (6-point) 0.70; SFAHP (7-point) 0.68; WHO algorithm 0.61. All triage tools showed worse prediction for receipt of organ support and better prediction for death without organ support. At the recommended threshold, PMEWS and the WHO criteria showed good sensitivity (0.96 and 0.95 respectively), at the expense of specificity (0.31 and 0.27 respectively). NEWS2 showed similar sensitivity (0.96) and specificity (0.28) when a lower threshold than recommended was used. Conclusion: CURB-65, PMEWS and NEWS2 provide good but not excellent prediction for adverse outcome in suspected COVID-19, and predicted death without organ support better than receipt of organ support. PMEWS, the WHO criteria and NEWS2 (using a lower threshold than usually recommended) provide good sensitivity at the expense of specificity.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Emergency department clinicians can use triage tools to predict adverse outcome and support management decisions for children presenting with suspected COVID-19. We aimed to estimate the accuracy of triage tools for predicting severe illness in children presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected COVID-19 infection. Methods: We undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 44 EDs across the United Kingdom (UK). We collected data from children attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020, and used presenting data to determine the results of assessment using the WHO algorithm, swine flu hospital pathway for children (SFHPC), Paediatric Observation Priority Score (POPS) and Childrens Observation and Severity Tool (COAST). We recorded 30-day outcome data (death or receipt of respiratory, cardiovascular or renal support) to determine prognostic accuracy for adverse outcome. Results: We collected data from 1530 children, including 26 (1.7%) with an adverse outcome. C-statistics were 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.73-0.87) for the WHO algorithm, 0.80 (0.71-0.90) for POPS, 0.76 (0.67-0.85) for COAST, and 0.71 (0.59-0.82) for SFHPC. Using pre-specified thresholds, the WHO algorithm had the highest sensitivity (0.85) and lowest specificity (0.75), but POPS and COAST could optimise sensitivity (0.96 and 0.92 respectively) at the expense of specificity (0.25 and 0.38 respectively) by using a threshold of any score above zero instead of the pre-specified threshold. Conclusion: Existing triage tools have good but not excellent prediction for adverse outcome in children with suspected COVID-19. POPS and COAST could achieve an appropriate balance of sensitivity and specificity for supporting decisions to discharge home by considering any score above zero to be positive.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 poses a major challenge to care homes, as SARS-CoV-2 is readily transmitted and causes disproportionately severe disease in older people. Here, we report on 6,600 COVID-19 cases from the East of England, 1,167 of which were identified as residents from 337 care homes. Older age and being a care home resident were associated with increased mortality. SARS-CoV-2 genomes were available for 700 residents from 292 care homes. By integrating genomic and temporal data we defined 409 viral clusters within the 292 homes, indicating two different patterns - outbreaks among care home residents and independent introductions with limited onward transmission. Approximately 70% of residents in the genomic analysis were admitted to hospital during the study period, providing extensive opportunities for transmission between care homes and hospitals. Limiting viral transmission between care home residents should be a key target for infection control to reduce COVID-19 mortality in this population.",

    "abstract": "Objective We aim to provide a snapshot of the levels of burnout, anxiety, depression and distress among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, setting, participants We distributed an online survey via social media in June 2020 that was open to any healthcare worker. The primary outcome measure was symptoms of burnout as measured using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI). Secondary outcomes of depression, anxiety and distress as measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, General Anxiety Scale-7, and Impact of Events Scale-Revised were recorded along with subjective measures of stress. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with burnout, depression, anxiety and distress. Results Of 539 persons responding to the survey, 90% were female, and 26% were aged 41-50 years, 53% were nurses. Participants with moderate-to-severe burnout were younger (49% [206/424] versus 33% [38/115] under 40 years, P=0.004), and more likely to have pre-existing comorbidities (21% versus 12%, P=0.031). They were twice as likely to have been redeployed from their usual role (22% versus 11%; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-3.3, P=0.042), or to work in an area dedicated to COVID-19 patients (50% versus 32%, adjusted OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.8, P<0.001), and were almost 4-times more likely to have previous depression (24% versus 7%; adjusted OR 3.6, 95% CI 2.2-5.9, P=0.012). A supportive workplace team and male sex protected against burnout reducing the odds by 40% (adjusted OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.7, P<0.001) and 70% (adjusted OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.5, P=0.003), respectively. Conclusion Independent predictors of burnout were younger staff, redeployment to a new working area, working with patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, and being female or having a previous history of depression. Evaluation of existing psychological support interventions is required with targeted approaches to ensure support is available to those most at risk.",

    "abstract": "Importance. As universities around the world decide whether to remain open or to close their campuses because of the COVID-19 pandemic, they often are doing so without objective information on the preferences and risk tolerance of their students. Objectives. To quantify: 1) risk tolerance for in-person instruction; 2) willingness to pay for in-person instruction versus online-only instruction; and 3) risk-tolerance for social activities held off campus among knowledgable students. Design, Setting, and Participants. We developed an automated survey tool that administered a standard gamble exercise grounded in game theory to 46 Columbia University public health graduate students who were knowledgeable about COVID-19 and who had experience with both online and offline coursework. Students were asked to trade between the risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 and: 1) attending classes in-person versus online and 2) attending parties in the greater New York City area. We also assessed their willingness to pay for online only tuition, and plans to travel off campus. Main Outcome Measures. The decision point in iterative trade-offs between risk of infection with COVID-19 and a desired goal (taking classes in-person or attending social events). Results. On average, students were willing to accept a 23% (standard error [SE]: 4%) risk of infection on campus over the semester in exchange for the opportunity to attend classes in-person. Students were willing-to-pay only 48% (SE: 3%) of typical in-person tuition were courses held exclusively online, and no students were willing to pay full price for online-only instruction. Students planned to leave campus an average of 3.6 times per week (SE: 0.54), and 15% of the students would be willing to attend a party in the community surrounding the university even if the prevalence of circulating COVID-19 were high. Conclusions and Relevance. Students with a strong knowledge of COVID-19 transmission and risks are an enigma: they are willing to pay only around 50% for online classes but likely to engage in activities that present significant barriers to holding in-person classes. This enigma underscores the conundrum facing universities.",

    "abstract": "Background and objectives: Several antibody tests are available to detect SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies, many of which address different antigens. Rapid point-of-care (POC) tests have been doubted due to an eventual risk of production errors, although it is unstudied whether such error would affect test sensitivity and/or specificity. We aimed to evaluate two separate production lots of a commercially available test intended for rapid detection of IgM and IgG against the N-terminal part of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1). Materials and methods: Serum samples from individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, by RT-PCR and/or serology, and pre-COVID-19 negative control sera gathered from a biobank during 2018 were collected. The presence of anti-S1 IgM/IgG was verified by an in-house Luminex-based serological assay, serving as reference method. The index test was a commercially available rapid POC-test (the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette [Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech Co Ltd, Huzhou, Zhejiang, China/Healgen Scientific, LLC, U.S.A.]). Results: One hundred samples were verified positive for anti-S1 IgG (median fluorescence intensity (MFI) greater than or equal to 900) and 74 for anti-S1 IgM (MFI greater than or equal to 700), confirmed by RT-PCR (n=90) and/or serology (n=89). None of the negative controls (n=200; MFI <300) had SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 IgM, while one tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 IgG. For the two lots, the sensitivities of the rapid test were 93.2% (69/74; 95% CI: 85.1% - 97.1%) and 87.8% (65/74; 95% CI: 78.5% - 93.5%) for IgM, respectively 93.0% (93/100; 95% CI: 86.3% - 96.6%) and 100.0% for IgG (100/100; 95% CI: 96.3% - 100.0%). The specificity for both lots was 100% for IgM (200/200; 95% CI: 98.1% - 100%) and 99.5% for IgG (199/200; 95% CI: 97.2% - 99.9%). The positive predictive value was 100% for IgM and 98.9% and 99.0% for IgG. The negative predictive value was 95.7% and 97.6% for IgM, and 96.6% and 100.0% for IgG. Conclusion: The rapid POC-test used in this study is suitable to assess SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 specific IgM/IgG, as a measure of previous virus exposure on an individual level. While the specificity was not affected by production lot, external validation of separate lots of rapid POC-tests is encouraged to ensure high sensitivity before market introduction.",

    "abstract": "Background: By mid-July 2020, more than 108,000 COVID-19 cases had been diagnosed in Canada with more than half in the province of Quebec. To be prepared for a potential second wave of COVID-19 in the fall, it seems of utmost importance to analyze the epidemiological and socio-economic characteristics of the spring outbreak in the population. Method: We conducted an online survey of the participants of the CARTaGENE population-based cohort, composed of middle-aged and older adults. We collected information on socio-demographic, lifestyle, health condition, COVID-related symptoms and COVID-19 testing. We studied the association between these factors and two outcomes: the status of having been tested for SARS-CoV-2 and the status of having received a positive test when having been tested. These associations were evaluated with univariate and multivariate analyzes using a hybrid tree-based regression model. Results: Among the 8,129 respondents from the CARTaGENE cohort, 649 were tested for COVID-19 and 41 were positive. Medical workers and individuals having a contact with a COVID-19 patient had the highest probabilities of being tested (32% and 42.4%, respectively) and of being positive (17.2% and 13.0%, respectively) among those tested. 7.6% of the participants declared that they have experienced at least one of the four COVID-related symptoms chosen by the Public Health authorities (fever, cough, dyspnea, anosmia) but were not tested. Results from the tree-based model analyzes adjusted on exposure factors show that the combination of dyspnea, dry cough and fever was highly associated with being tested whereas anosmia, fever, and headache were the most discriminant factors for having a positive test among those tested. During the spring outbreak, more than one third of the participants have experienced a decrease in access to health services. There were sex and age differences in the socio-economic and emotional impacts of the pandemic. Conclusion: We have shown some discrepancies between the symptoms associated with being tested and being positive. In particular, the anosmia is a major discriminant symptom for positivity whereas ear-nose-throat symptoms seem not to be COVID-related. The results also emphasize the need of increasing the accessibility of testing for the general population.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Very little is known about possible clinical sequelae that may persist after resolution of the acute Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). A recent longitudinal cohort from Italy including 143 patients recovered after hospitalisation with COVID-19 reported that 87% had at least one ongoing symptom at 60 day follow-up. Early indications suggest that patients with COVID-19 may need even more psychological support than typical ICU patients. The assessment of risk factors for longer term consequences requires a longitudinal study linked to data on pre-existing conditions and care received during the acute phase of illness. Methods and analysis This is an international open-access prospective, observational multi-site study. It will enrol patients following a diagnosis of COVID-19. Tier 1 is developed for following up patients day 28 post-discharge, additionally at 3 to 6 months intervals. This module can be used to identify sub-sets of patients experiencing specific symptomatology or syndromes for further follow up. A Tier 2 module will be developed for in-clinic, in-depth follow up. The primary aim is to characterise physical consequences in patients post-COVID-19. Secondary aim includes estimating the frequency of and risk factors for post-COVID- 19 medical sequalae, psychosocial consequences and post-COVID-19 mortality. A subset of patients will have sampling to characterize longer term antibody, innate and cell-mediated immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. Ethics and dissemination This collaborative, open-access study aims to characterize the frequency of and risk factors for long-term consequences and characterise the immune response over time in patients following a diagnosis of COVID-19 and facilitate standardized and longitudinal data collection globally. The outcomes of this study will inform strategies to prevent long term consequences; inform clinical management, direct rehabilitation, and inform public health management to reduce overall morbidity and improve outcomes of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Importance: Early epidemiological studies report associations of diverse cardiometabolic conditions especially body mass index (BMI), with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity, but causality has not been established. Identifying causal risk factors is critical to inform preventive strategies aimed at modifying disease risk. Objective: We sought to evaluate the causal associations of cardiometabolic conditions with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Design: Two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) Study. Setting: Population-based cohorts that contributed to the genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis by the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Participants: Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 diagnosed by RNA PCR, serologic testing, or clinician diagnosis. Population controls defined as anyone who was not a case in the cohorts. Exposures: Selected genetic variants associated with 17 cardiometabolic diseases, including diabetes, coronary artery disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, and BMI, at p<5 x 10-8 from published largescale GWAS. Main outcomes: We performed an inverse-variance weighted averages of variant-specific causal estimates for susceptibility, defined as people who tested positive for COVID-19 vs. population controls, and severity, defined as patients hospitalized with COVID-19 vs. population controls, and repeated the analysis for BMI using effect estimates from UKBB. To estimate direct and indirect causal effects of BMI through obesity-related cardiometabolic diseases, we performed pairwise multivariable MR. We used p<0.05/17 exposure/2 outcomes=0.0015 to declare statistical significance. Results: Genetically increased BMI was causally associated with testing positive for COVID-19 [6,696 cases / 1,073,072 controls; p=6.7 x 10-4, odds ratio and 95% confidence interval 1.08 (1.03, 1.13) per kg/m2] and a higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization [3,199 cases/897,488 controls; p=8.7 x 10-4, 1.12 (1.04, 1.21) per kg/m2]. In the multivariable MR, the direct effect of BMI was abolished upon conditioning on the effect on type 2 diabetes but persisted when conditioning on the effects on coronary artery disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, and c-reactive protein. No other cardiometabolic exposures tested were associated with a higher risk of poorer COVID-19 outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance: Genetic evidence supports BMI as a causal risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. This relationship may be mediated via type 2 diabetes. Obesity may have amplified the disease burden of the COVID-19 pandemic either single-handedly or through its metabolic consequences.",

    "abstract": "Background This study aimed to describe the population at risk of severe COVID-19 due to underlying health conditions across the United Kingdom in 2019. Methods We used anonymised electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD to describe the point prevalence on 5 March 2019 of the at-risk population following national guidance. Prevalence for any risk condition and for each individual condition is given overall and stratified by age and region. We repeated the analysis on 5 March 2014 for full regional representation and to describe prevalence of underlying health conditions in pregnancy. We additionally described the population of cancer survivors, and assessed the value of linked secondary care records for ascertaining COVID-19 at-risk status. Findings On 5 March 2019, 24.4% of the UK population were at risk due to a record of at least one underlying health condition, including 8.3% of school-aged children, 19.6% of working-aged adults, and 66.2% of individuals aged 70 years or more. 7.1% of the population had multimorbidity. The size of the at-risk population was stable over time comparing 2014 to 2019, despite increases in chronic liver disease and diabetes and decreases in chronic kidney disease and current asthma. Separately, 1.6% of the population had a new diagnosis of cancer in the past five years. Interpretation The population at risk of severe COVID-19 (aged [&ge;]70 years, or with an underlying health condition) comprises 18.5 million individuals in the UK, including a considerable proportion of school-aged and working-aged individuals.",

    "abstract": "People may experience a heightened level of stress reactions during a pandemic event and in an isolated social environment. A multi-national survey about such mental health information about COVID-19 was conducted in May 2020 across six Asian regions: Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. Data were collected from a population representative sample of 11,895 adults on their stress symptoms and reactions to COVID-19 and the related public health measures. 59.1% of the respondents showed at least one substantial stress symptom. The situation was particularly worrying in South Korea, where 75% of the respondents reported substantial stress symptoms. Respondents who were young, educated, lived in an urban area, had a high socio-economic status, had a history of chronic illness or mental illness, or who lived with a pregnant woman, elderly or children were most vulnerable to stress during the pandemic. Stress reactions showed a positive relationship with the amount of time spent following news about the COVID-19 outbreak. Asian adults coped with their stress by preparing safety equipment and extra daily commodities (62.4%) and by following government-issued public health measures (60.1%). Most Asian (71%) also frequently checked on the safety of family members and friends to keep each other safe. The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated stringent public health measures have largely increased the prevalence of substantial stress symptoms across multiple Asian regions. Governments should prepare this mental health pandemic and the associated social repercussions.",

Recently, it was shown that it is possible to predict potential COVID-19 cases using cross-sectional self-reported disease-related symptoms. Using a previously reported COVID-19 prediction model, we show that it is possible to conduct a GWAS on predicted COVID-19 which benefits from a larger sample size in order to gain new insights into the genetic susceptibility of the disease. Furthermore, we find suggestive evidence that genetic variants for other viral infectious diseases do not overlap with COVID-19 susceptibility and that severity of COVID-19 may have a different genetic architecture compared to COVID-19 susceptibility. Our findings demonstrate the added value of using self-reported symptom assessments to quickly monitor novel endemic viral outbreaks in a scenario of limited testing. Should there be another outbreak of a novel infectious disease, then we recommend repeatedly collecting data of disease-related symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Background Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), a novel inflammatory marker, has been suggested to be able to predict the severity of COVID-19 patients. This systematic review aims to evaluate the association between PLR levels on admission and the severity of COVID-19 patients. Methods A systematic literature search was done on 23 July 2020 to identify peer-reviewed studies across four different databases (Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane Library), preprints from two databases (MedRxiv and SSRN), and grey literature from two databases (WHO COVID-19 Global Research Database and Center for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article). Research articles comparing the PLR value on admission in adult patients with COVID-19 with varying degrees of severity were included in the analysis. The following keywords were used for the search: 'COVID-19', 'PLR', 'severity', and 'mortality'. The inverse variance method was used to calculate the pooled effect standardized mean difference (SMD) along with its 95% confidence interval (CI). Results A total of seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, six of which were conducted in China. From a total of 998 participants included, 316 (31.7%) had severe diseases; and those in the severe group were generally older and had underlying diseases compared to the non-severe group. In comparison to non-severe patients, the meta-analysis showed that severe COVID-19 patients had higher PLR levels on admission (SMD 0.68; 95%CI 0.43-0.93; I2 =58%). Conclusion High PLR levels on admission were associated with severe COVID-19 cases. Therefore, on-admission PLR level is a novel, cost-effective, and readily available biomarker with a promising prognostic role for determining the severity of COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "Background: Emerging data suggest variability in susceptibility and outcome to Covid-19 infection. Identifying the risk-factors associated with infection and outcomes in cancer patients is necessary to develop healthcare recommendations. Methods: We analyzed electronic health records of the US National Veterans Administration healthcare system and assessed the prevalence of Covid-19 infection in cancer patients. We evaluated the proportion of cancer patients tested for Covid-19 and their confirmed positivity, with clinical characteristics, and outcome, and stratified by demographics, comorbidities, cancer treatment and cancer type. Results: Of 22914 cancer patients tested for Covid-19, 1794 (7.8%) were positive. The prevalence of Covid-19 was similar across all ages. Higher prevalence was observed in African-American (AA) (15%) compared to white (5.5%; P<.001), in Hispanic vs non-Hispanic population and in patients with hematologic malignancy compared to those with solid tumors (10.9% vs 7.7%; P<.001). Conversely, prevalence was lower in current smoker patients, patients with other co-morbidities and having recently received cancer therapy (<6 months). The Covid-19 attributable mortality was 10.9%. Highest mortality rates were observed in older patients, those with renal dysfunction, higher Charlson co-morbidity score and with certain cancer types. Recent (<6 months) or past treatment did not influence mortality. Importantly, AA patients had 3.5-fold higher Covid-19 attributable hospitalization, however had similar mortality rate as white patients. Conclusion: Pre-existence of cancer affects both susceptibility to Covid-19 infection and eventual outcome. The overall Covid-19 attributable mortality in cancer patients is affected by age, co-morbidity and specific cancer types, however, race or recent treatment including immunotherapy does not impact outcome.",

    "abstract": "Patients with signs of COVID-19 were tested with CDC approved diagnostic RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 using RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal/nasal swabs. In order to determine the variants of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in the state of Nevada, 200 patient specimens from COVID-19 patients were sequenced through our robust protocol for sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Our protocol enabled sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genome directly from the specimens, with even very low viral loads, without the need of culture-based amplification. This allowed the identification of specific nucleotide variants including those coding for D614G and clades defining mutations. These sequences were further analyzed for determining SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in the state of Nevada and their phylogenetic relationships with other variants present in the united states and the world during the same period of the outbreak. Our study reports the occurrence of a novel variant in the nsp12 (RNA dependent RNA Polymerase) protein at residue 323 (314aa of orf1b) to Phenylalanine (F) from Proline (P), present in the original isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1). This 323F variant is found at a very high frequency (46% of the tested specimen) in Northern Nevada. Functional significance of this unique and highly prevalent variant of SARS-CoV-2 with RdRp mutation is currently under investigation but structural modeling showed this 323aa residue in the interface domain of RdRp, which is required for association with accessory proteins. In conclusion, we report the introduction of specific SARS-CoV-2 variants at a very high frequency within a distinct geographic location, which is important for clinical and public health perspectives in understanding the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 while in circulation.",

    "abstract": "Background School closures are a well-established non-pharmaceutical intervention in the event of infectious disease outbreaks, and have been implemented in many countries across the world, including the UK, to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2. As governments begin to relax restrictions on public life there is a need to understand the potential impact that reopening schools may have on transmission. Methods We used data provided by the UK Department for Education to construct a network of English schools, connected through pairs of pupils resident at the same address. We used the network to evaluate the potential for transmission between schools, and for long range propagation across the network, under different reopening scenarios. Results Amongst the options evaluated we found that reopening only Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 (4-6 and 10-11 year olds) resulted in the lowest risk of transmission between schools, with outbreaks within a single school unlikely to result in outbreaks in adjacent schools in the network. The additional reopening of Years 10 and 12 (14-15 and 16-17 year olds) resulted in an increase in the risk of transmission between schools comparable to reopening all primary school years (4-11 year olds). However, the majority of schools presented low risk of initiating widespread transmission through the school system. Reopening all secondary school years (11-18 year olds) resulted in large potential outbreak clusters putting up to 50% of households connected to schools at risk of infection if sustained transmission within schools was possible. Conclusions Reopening secondary school years is likely to have a greater impact on community transmission than reopening primary schools in England. Keeping transmission within schools limited is essential for reducing the risk of large outbreaks amongst school-aged children and their household members.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn most countries, contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases are asked to quarantine for 14 days following exposure, to limit asymptomatic onward transmission. We assessed the merit of RT-PCR testing in reducing the length of quarantine, using the UK as a case study.\n\nMethodsWe used an agent-based model to simulate an exposed contacts contact tracing detecting delay, incubation period, probability to become symptomatic, infectivity profile, and time-varying PCR detection probability. Assuming self-isolation on symptom onset, we assess the impact of the current 14 day quarantine strategy for all exposed contacts on their onward transmission potential and compare to alternative quarantine lengths with or without PCR tests during quarantine.\n\nFindingsSelf-isolation on symptoms onset alone can prevent 39% (95% Uncertainty Interval for super spreading events: 34, 45%) of onward transmission from secondary cases. An additional 14 days post-exposure quarantine for all contacts reduces transmission by 70% (95% UI: 39, 90%). A negative PCR test taken upon tracing or 7 days after exposure can reduce transmission by 62% (95% UI: 40, 84%) or 68% (95% UI: 40, 88%) respectively. Halving contact tracing delays of currently 4 days reduces pre-tracing transmission potential from 26% (95% UI: 7, 56%) to 14% (95% UI: 5, 42%).\n\nInterpretationPCR testing may allow for a substantial reduction in quarantine needs or even replacing quarantine requirements with no or a small excess in transmission risk respectively. Reducing contact tracing delays can help prevent a substantial amount of transmission.\n\nFundingNational Institute for Health Research, UK Research and Innovation, Wellcome Trust, and EU Horizon 2020.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSDuring the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a standard 14-day quarantine period has been required from the day a contact was exposed to an index case to avert onwards transmission. This approach aims to avoid infected contacts returning to their normal life during their pre-symptomatic period. This strategy presents a crucial part in the global pandemic response to interrupt transmission chains, however it places considerable social and economic pressure on contacts. As case numbers are rapidly rising across Europe an effective, practical and widely accepted strategy to limit secondary transmission is key to the control of SARS-CoV-2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis of optimal strategies to reduce transmission from contact traced secondary cases.\n\nAdded value of this studyWe simulated the ability of different quarantine and testing strategies to reduce the transmission potential of secondary cases. We found that the common post-exposure quarantine period of 14 days is equally effective as PCR testing of contacts after 7 days of quarantine. PCR testing immediately on tracing with no quarantine requirements following a negative test result would avert slightly less transmission potential from secondary cases (62% vs 70%). Delays in identifying contacts and hence delayed quarantine as well as low adherence substantially reduces the ability to reduce secondary transmission.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceThe ability to test timely and at scale could shorten current delays in contact tracing and thereby reduce the risk for secondary transmission. Similarly, such testing capacity would allow to substantially shorten necessary quarantine periods and dampen the economic and social impact while potentially increasing compliance.",

    "abstract": "Background Since COVID19 was declared a pandemic, attempts have been made to monitor trends over time and to compare countries and regions. Insufficient testing for COVID19 underestimates the incidence and inflates the case/fatality proportion. Given the age and sex distribution of morbidity and mortality from COVID19, the underlying sex and age distribution of a population needs to be accounted for. The aim of this paper is to present a method for monitoring trends of COVID19 using adjusted mortality trend ratios (AMTR). Methods Age and sex mortality distribution of a reference population composed of the first 14,086 fatalities which occurred before the end of March and were reported in Europe by some countries were used to calculate age and sex specific mortality rates per 1,000,000 population. These were applied to each country population to calculate the expected deaths. Adjusted Mortality Trend Ratios (AMTRs) with 95% confidence intervals (C.I.) were calculated for selected European countries from 17/03/2020 to 22/06/2020 by dividing observed cumulative mortality, by expected mortality times the crude mortality of the reference population. These estimated the sex and age adjusted mortality for COVID19 per million population in each country. Results The cumulative mortality from COVID19, the crude mortality rates, and the AMTRs were calculated for each country and compared. United Kingdom, Italy, France and Spain registered the highest mortality in Europe. On 22/06/2020 in Europe the total mortality rate from COVID-19 was 352 per 1,000,000 inhabitants; and it was highest in Belgium (850 per 1,000,000 inhabitants) followed by Spain, UK, Italy, Sweden and France. When accounting for the underlying age and sex structure of each country, Belgium remained the single country experiencing the highest AMTR of 929 per million inhabitants on 22/06/2020; however Ireland (which had a CMR in line with the total European population) emerged as having experienced a much more important impact of COVID19 mortality with an AMTR of 550/million on 22/06/2020, higher than Sweden and Italy. Conclusions In understanding and managing the pandemic of COVID19, comparable international data is a priority. Our methods allow a fair comparison of mortality in space and over time. The authors urge the WHO, given the absence of age and sex-specific mortality data for direct standardisation, to adopt this method to estimate the comparative mortality from COVID19 pandemic worldwide.",

We quantified the impact of less than perfect diagnostic test accuracy on populations, and on individuals, in low prevalence settings, focusing on false positives and the role of confirmatory testing. Methods: We developed a simple, interactive tool to assess the impact of different combinations of test sensitivity, specificity and infection prevalence in a notional population of 100,000. We derived numbers of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives, positive predictive value (PPV, the percentage of test positives that are true positives) and overall test accuracy for three testing strategies: (1) single test for all; (2) add repeat testing in test positives; (3) add further repeat testing in those with discrepant results. We also assessed the impact on test results for individuals having one, two or three tests under these three strategies. Results: With sensitivity of 80%, infection prevalence of 1 in 2,000, and specificity 99.9% on all tests, PPV in the tested population of 100,000 will be only 29% with one test, increasing to >99.5% (100% when rounded to the nearest %) with repeat testing in strategies 2 or 3. More realistically, if specificity is 95% for the first and 99.9% for subsequent tests, single test PPV will be only 1%, increasing to 86% with repeat testing in strategy 2, or 79% with strategy 3 (albeit with 6 fewer false negatives than strategy 2). In the whole population, or in particular individuals, PPV increases as infection becomes more common in the population but falls to unacceptably low levels with lower test specificity. Conclusion: To avoid multiple unnecessary restrictions on whole populations, and in particular individuals, from widespread population testing for SARS-CoV-2, the crucial roles of extremely high test specificity and of confirmatory testing must be fully appreciated and incorporated into policy decisions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPeople of color in the U.S. have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of rates of infection and morbidity. Explanations for these disparities include over-representation as essential workers and long-standing inequities in access to health services. Prior to the pandemic, racial discrimination has been associated with depression and general anxiety. However, the effect of discrimination and racial bias specific to the Coronavirus on mental health has not been examined. The aim of this study was to assess the effects Coronavirus victimization distress and Coronavirus racial bias beliefs on the mental health of young adult people of color.\n\nMethodAn online survey administered to a national sample of 350 Black, Indigenous and Latinx adults (18 - 25 years) included Coronavirus health risks, prescription and financial security, measure of depression and anxiety and 2 new psychometrically validated measures for Coronavirus related victimization distress and racial bias.\n\nResultsEmployment, number of Coronavirus health risks, Coronavirus victimization distress and Coronavirus racial bias were positively correlated with each other and with depression and anxiety. By contrast, household income and perceived financial and prescription security were negatively correlated with Coronavirus victimization, Coronavirus racial bias and with the mental health indices. Structural equation modeling controlling for demographic variables indicated perceived Coronavirus racial bias mediated the effect of Coronavirus victimization distress on both mental health measures across all groups.\n\nConclusionsResults suggest the COVID-19 pandemic has created new pathways to mental health disparities among young adults of color by reversing formerly protective factors such as employment, and by exacerbating structural and societal inequities linked to race. Findings highlight the necessity of creating mental health services tailored to the specific needs of racial/ethnic minorities during the current and future health crises.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for robust data linkage systems and methods for identifying outbreaks of disease in near real-time. Using self-reported app data and the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank, we demonstrate the use of sophisticated spatial modelling for near-real-time prediction of COVID-19 prevalence at small-area resolution to inform strategic government policy areas. A pre-requisite to an effective control strategy is that predictions need to be accompanied by estimates of their precision, to guard against over-reaction to potentially spurious features of 'best guess' predictions. In the UK, important emerging risk-factors such as social deprivation or ethnicity vary over small distances, hence risk needs to be modelled at fine spatial resolution to avoid aggregation bias. We demonstrate that existing geospatial statistical methods originally developed for global health applications are well-suited to this task and can be used in an anonymised databank environment, thus preserving the privacy of the individuals who contribute their data.",

    "abstract": "Background: Severe Acute Respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in Wuhan, China, has turned into a pandemic. All countries have implemented multiple strategies to try mitigating the losses caused by this virus. To stop the rapid spread of the disease and in compliance with the World Health Organizations social distancing policy, the government of Bangladesh has implemented a number of strategies, one of which is to limit the spread of the virus in hospitals by postponing elective procedures and providing only emergency services in the hospitals. The objective of this survey was to assess the current status of pediatric surgical procedures in different hospitals in Bangladesh and assess the effects of the current restrictions along with their implications in the long run. Materials and Methods: A survey was performed among doctors from public and private hospitals in Bangladesh to evaluate the status on pediatric surgery. Results: The results clearly revealed the lack of a significant reduction in doctors exposure to SARS-CoV-2 by postponing elective procedures. Conclusion: Keeping in mind the socioeconomic and health care conditions of the country, the author recommend resuming elective surgical procedures.

    "abstract": "The evolution of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) into a pandemic has severely hampered the usage of public transit systems. In a post-COVID-19 world, we may see an increased reliance on autonomous cars and personal rapid transit (PRT) systems, with inherent physical distancing, over buses, trains, and aircraft for intracity, intercity, and interstate travel. However, air travel would continue to be the dominant mode of intercontinental transportation for humans. In this study, we perform a comprehensive computational analysis of typical intercontinental aircraft ventilation systems to determine the seat where environmental factors are most conducive to human comfort with regards to air quality, protection from orally or nasally released pollutants such as CO2 and coronavirus, and thermal comfort levels. Air velocity, temperature, and air pollutant concentration emitted from the nose/mouth of fellow travelers are considered for both Boeing and Airbus planes. In each plane, first class, business class, and economy class sections were analyzed. We present conclusions as to which is the optimum seat in each section of each plane and provide the data of the environmental conditions to support our inferences. The findings may be used by the general public to decide which seat to occupy for their next intercontinental flight. Alternatively, the commercial airliners can use such a model to plan the occupancy of the aircraft on long-duration intercontinental flights (viz., Airbus A380 and Boeing B747).",

Methods National REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-2 (REACT-2) seroprevalence study using self-administered lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test for IgG among a random population sample of 100,000 adults over 18 years in England, 20 June to 13 July 2020. Results Completed questionnaires were available for 109,076 participants, yielding 5,544 IgG positive results and adjusted (for test performance), re-weighted (for sampling) prevalence of 6.0% (95% CI: 5.8, 6.1). Highest prevalence was in London (13.0% [12.3, 13.6]), among people of Black or Asian (mainly South Asian) ethnicity (17.3% [15.8, 19.1] and 11.9% [11.0, 12.8] respectively) and those aged 18-24 years (7.9% [7.3, 8.5]). Care home workers with client-facing roles had adjusted odds ratio of 3.1 (2.5, 3.8) compared with non-essential workers. One third (32.2%, [31.0-33.4]) of antibody positive individuals reported no symptoms. Among symptomatic cases, the majority (78.8%) reported symptoms during the peak of the epidemic in England in March (31.3%) and April (47.5%) 2020. We estimate that 3.36 million (3.21, 3.51) people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in England to end June 2020, with an overall infection fatality ratio of 0.90% (0.86, 0.94). Conclusion The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection in England disproportionately affected ethnic minority groups and health and care home workers. The higher risk of infection in these groups may explain, at least in part, their increased risk of hospitalisation and mortality from COVID-19.",

Data sources: PubMed, bioRxiv.org and medRxiv.org were searched for studies suggestive of effective treatments for COVID-19. Additional studies were identified via a snowballing method applied to the references of retrieved papers as well as a subsequent targeted search for drug names. Review methods: Inclusion criteria included any case series or randomised control trials in any language that were published from 18th December 2019 to 18th April 2020 and described COVID-19 treatment. Of an initial 2140 studies identified from the initial search, 29 studies were found to meet the inclusion criteria and included in this comprehensive systematic review. Results: 19 studies of antiviral treatments for COVID-19 have been reported and seven studies for immunomodulatory treatments. Six randomised controlled trials have been published with one positive trial for Hydroxychloroquine. This small study consisted of 31 patients though subsequent studies showed contradictory findings. All the remaining studies were observational studies, retrospective case reviews or non-randomised trials and these results are difficult to interpret due to methodological issues. Conclusions: To date, an impressive number of studies have been performed in a short space of time, indicative of a resilient clinical trials infrastructure. However, there is a lack of high quality evidence to support any novel treatments for COVID-19 to be incorporated into the current standard of care. The majority of the studies of treatments for COVID-19 could only be found in pre-print servers. Future clinical reviews should therefore be Comprehensive Systematic Reviews involving pre-print studies to prevent potential unnecessary replications of clinical studies.",

Objective: To assess the association between NSAID use and deaths from COVID-19 using OpenSAFELY, a secure analytical platform. Design: Two cohort studies (1st March-14th June 2020). Setting: Working on behalf of NHS England, we used routine clinical data from >17 million patients in England linked to death data from the Office for National Statistics. Participants: Study 1: General population (people with an NSAID prescription in the last three years). Study 2: people with rheumatoid arthritis/osteoarthritis. Exposures: Current NSAID prescription within the 4 months before 1st March 2020. Main Outcome and Measure: We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for COVID-19 related death in people currently prescribed NSAIDs, compared with those not currently prescribed NSAIDs, adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities and other medications. Results: In Study 1, we included 535,519 current NSAID users and 1,924,095 non-users in the general population. The crude HR for current use was 1.25 (95% CI, 1.07-1.46), versus non-use. We observed no evidence of difference in risk of COVID-19 related death associated with current use (HR, 0.95, 95% CI, 0.80-1.13) in the fully adjusted model. In Study 2, we included 1,711,052 people with rheumatoid arthritis/osteoarthritis, of whom 175,631 (10%) were current NSAID users. The crude HR for current use was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.36-0.52), versus non-use. In the fully adjusted model, we observed a lower risk of COVID-19 related death (HR, 0.78, 95% CI, 0.65-0.94) associated with current use of NSAID versus non-use. Conclusion and Relevance: We found no evidence of a harmful effect of NSAIDs on COVID-19 related deaths. Risks from COVID-19 do not need to influence decisions about therapeutic use of NSAIDs.",

    "abstract": "Background The number of confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases surge substantially in resource-poor settings within the fragile health system. Since there are no proven vaccine and treatment in place against the disease, controlling strategy mainly rely on preventive measures. However, data on the extent of implementing physical distancing and other preventive measures were under estimated. This study, therefore, investigated these gaps among people in Arba Minch town, southern Ethiopia. Methods We conducted a community based cross-sectional study in Arba Minch town; from 15-30 June 2020. Data were collected using interviewer administered questionnaire and checklist. Then, data were cleaned, coded and entered to EpiData version 4.4.2, and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Results Of the total participants (459), 43.6% achieved above the mean score (6) on preventive measures of COVID-19. Only 29.8% of participants kept the recommended physical distance, and surprisingly, in all public gathering places the distance was not kept totally. In addition, of the total participants, only 37.7% had face-mask use practice; 20.5% had hand sanitizer use practice, and 13.1% were measuring their body temperature every two weeks. Moreover, 42.5% of participants avoided attendance in public gatherings; 44.7% stopped touching their nose, eye and mouth; 55.6% practiced stay-at-home; and 60% had frequent hand washing practice. Majority of participants (66.7%) practiced covering their mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing; 68.2% had treatment seeking behavior if they experience flue like symptoms; 69.1% practiced isolating themselves while having flue like symptoms; and 89.3% avoided hand shaking. Conclusions The findings of this study suggest that physical distancing and other COVID-19 preventive measures were inadequately implemented among people in Arba Minch town. Thus, an urgent call for action is demanding to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 as early as possible before it brings a devastating impact.",

    "abstract": "Health inequalities across nations reinforce social and economic differences. The European Commission has outlined its commitment to reducing health inequalities. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a disruptive event with global, national, and local effects on every aspect of a societys life. Therefore, it is of interest to quantify and display health (in)equality induced by COVID-19 over time and on different geographic scales (global, continental, national, regional).\n\nWe aimed to perform a study of (in)equality regarding COVID-19 related data on infections and deaths using the Gini index (GI). A specific focus of our analysis is the (in)equality of infection fatality rates. The Gini index was developed to explore inequality in wealth within or between nations. It is a relative measure which quantifies the ratio of the mean absolute difference between non-negative numerical observations and their mean: GI=0 describes a situation where all values are equal, GI=1 corresponds to one single positive observation among all non-negative observations. We use global, nation- and statewide data to evaluate the inequality at different geographical scales. We also reflect on the suitability of the Gini index to monitor equality aspects of the pandemic.\n\nData from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic show a considerable amount of inequality in the global distribution of infections and deaths. Only few countries contribute largely to the total infection and death toll. Inequality may result from heterogeneous reporting systems, heterogeneous policy making to fight the pandemic, heterogeneous health systems, and demographic structures. Inequality decreases when going from continental to national or regional levels. Time trends at national level reflect local outbreaks. There is inequality in infection fatality rates, too. Because of equality of income or wealth within a society, low GIs ([&le;] 0.4) are related to positive connotations like fairness and justice. In the epidemiological setting, however, a GI=1 reflects the goal striven for: The epidemic is restricted to one region while the surroundings are not affected - the epidemic has failed to spread.\n\nWe used the Gini index to reflect inequality between incidence and death rates of nations or geographic regions. The interpretation of the differences between reported GIs is not straightforward. Furthermore, combined with the information presented by maps, the GI is a useful tool.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: With surging global demand for increased SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity, clinical laboratories seek automated, high-throughput molecular solutions, particularly for specimen types which do not rely upon supply of specialized collection devices or viral transport media (VTM). Saliva was evaluated as a diagnostic specimen for SARS-CoV-2 using the cobas SARS-CoV-2 Test on the cobas 6800 instrument. Methods: Saliva specimens submitted from various patient populations under investigation for COVID-19 from March-July 2020 were processed in the laboratory with sterile phosphate-buffered saline in a 1:2 dilution and vortexed with glass beads. The processed saliva samples were tested using a commercial assay for detection of the SARS-CoV-2 E gene (LightMix) in comparison to the cobas SARS-CoV-2 Test. Results: 22/64 (34.4%) of the saliva samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Positive and negative concordance between the LightMix and cobas assays were 100%. There was no cross-contamination of samples observed on the cobas 6800. The overall invalid rate for saliva on the cobas 6800 (1/128, 0.78%) was similar to the baseline invalid rate observed for nasopharyngeal swabs/VTM and plasma samples. Conclusions: Saliva is a feasible specimen type for SARS-CoV-2 testing on the cobas 6800, with potential to improve turnaround time and enhance testing capacity.",

    "abstract": "Background Contact patterns are the drivers of close-contacts infections, such as COVID-19. In an effort to control COVID-19 transmission in the UK, schools were closed on 23 March 2020. With social distancing in place, Primary Schools were partially re-opened on 1 June 2020, with plans to fully re-open in September 2020. The impact of social distancing and risk mitigation measures on childrens contact patterns is not known. Methods We conducted a structured expert elicitation of a sample of Primary Headteachers to quantify contact patterns within schools in pre-COVID-19 times and how these patterns were expected to change upon re-opening. Point estimates with uncertainty were determined by a formal performance-based algorithm. Additionally, we surveyed school Headteachers about risk mitigation strategies and their anticipated effectiveness. Results Expert elicitation provides estimates of contact patterns that are consistent with contact surveys. We report mean number of contacts per day for four cohorts within schools along with a range at 90% confidence for the variations of contacts among individuals. Prior to lockdown, we estimate that, mean numbers per day, younger children (Reception and Year 1) made 15 contacts [range 8..35] within school, older children (Year 6) 18 contacts [range 5..55], teaching staff 25 contacts [range 4..55) and non-classroom staff 11 contacts [range 2..27]. Compared to pre-COVID times, after schools re-opened the mean number of contacts were reduced by about 53% for young children, about 62% for older children, about 60% for classroom staff and about 64% for other staff. Contacts between teaching and non-teaching staff reduced by 80%, which is consistent with other independent estimates. The distributions of contacts per person are asymmetric indicating a heavy tail of individuals with high contact numbers. Conclusions We interpret the reduction in childrens contacts as a consequence of efforts to reduce mixing with interventions such as forming groups of children (bubbles) who are organized to learn together to limit contacts. Distributions of contacts for children and adults can be used to inform COVID-19 transmission modelling. Our findings suggest that while official DfE guidelines form the basis for risk mitigation in schools, individual schools have adopted their own bespoke strategies, often going beyond the guidelines.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 global crisis is facilitated by high virus transmission rates and high percentages of asymptomatic and presymptomatic infected individuals. Containing the pandemic hinged on combinations of social distancing and face mask use. Here we examine the efficacy of these measures, using an agent-based modeling approach that evaluates face masks and social distancing in realistic confined spaces scenarios. By explicitly considering different fractions of asymptomatic individuals, as well as a realistic hypothesis of face mask protection during inhaling and exhaling, we find that face masks are more effective than social distancing in curbing the infection. Importantly, combining face masks with even moderate social distancing provides optimal protection. The finding that widespread usage of face masks limits COVID-19 outbreaks can inform policies to reopening of social functions.\n\nAuthor summaryThe COVID-19 outbreak has created an enormous burden on the worldwide population. Among the various ways of preventing the spread of the virus, face masks have been proposed as a main way of reducing transmission. Yet, the interplay between the usage of face mask and other forms of Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention is still not completely clear. In this paper we introduce a stochastic individual-based model which aims at producing realistic scenarios of disease spread when mask wearing with different inward and outward efficacy and social distancing are enforced. The model elucidates the conditions which make the two forms of intervention synergistic in preventing the spread of the disease.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a discrete event simulation model to support the decision-making concerned with the short-term planning of the necessary hospital resources, especially Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, to face outbreaks, as the SARS-CoV-2. Being used as a short-term forecasting tool, the simulation model requires an accurate representation of the current system state and high fidelity in mimicking the system dynamics from that state. The two main components of the simulation model are the stochastic modeling of the admission of new patients and the patient flow through the hospital facilities. For the patient arrival process, we analyze different models based on growth curves of the twenty most affected countries (until June 15) and propose the use of the Gompertz curve. The length of stay is divided into several stages, each one modeled separately. We analyze the starting of the simulation model, which requires different procedures depending on the information available about the patients currently hospitalized. We also report the use of this simulation model during the COVID-19 outbreak in the Autonomous Community of Navarre, in Spain. Every day, the research team informed the regional logistic team in charge of planning the health resources, who programmed the ward and ICU beds based on the resulting predictions.",

    "abstract": "Aim: To investigate factors associated with intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Methods: Online cross-sectional survey of 1,500 UK adults, recruited from an existing online research panel. Data were collected between 14th and 17th July 2020. We used linear regression analyses to investigate associations between intention to be vaccinated for COVID-19 when a vaccine becomes available to you and socio-demographic factors, previous influenza vaccination, general vaccine attitudes and beliefs, attitudes and beliefs about COVID-19, and attitudes and beliefs about a COVID-19 vaccination. Results: 64% of participants reported being likely to be vaccinated against COVID-19; 27% were unsure and 9% reported being unlikely to be vaccinated. Personal and clinical characteristics, previous influenza vaccination, general vaccination beliefs, and beliefs and attitudes about COVID-19 and a COVID-19 vaccination explained 77% of the variance in vaccination intention. Intention to be vaccinated was associated with more positive general COVID-19 vaccination beliefs and attitudes, weaker beliefs that the vaccination would cause side effects or be unsafe, greater perceived information sufficiency to make an informed decision about COVID-19 vaccination, greater perceived risk of COVID-19 to others but not oneself, older age, and having been vaccinated for influenza last winter (2019/20). Conclusions: Despite uncertainty around the details of a COVID-19 vaccination, most participants reported intending to be vaccinated for COVID-19. Actual uptake will likely be lower. Vaccination intention reflects general vaccine beliefs and attitudes. Campaigns and messaging about a COVID-19 vaccination should emphasize the risk of COVID-19 to others and necessity for everyone to be vaccinated.",

    "abstract": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged as the cause of a global pandemic in 2019-2020. In March 2020 New York City became the USA epicenter for the pandemic. On March 27, 2020 a Malayan tiger (Panthera tigris jacksoni) at the Bronx Zoo in New York City developed a cough and wheezing with subsequent inappetence. Over the next week, an additional Malayan tiger and two Amur tigers (P. t. altaica) in the same building and three lions (Panthera leo krugeri) in a separate building also became ill. The index case was immobilized, and physical examination and bloodwork results were unremarkable. Thoracic radiography and ultrasonography revealed peribronchial cuffing with bronchiectasis, and mild lung consolidation with alveolar-interstitial syndrome, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified by real-time, reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) on oropharyngeal and nasal swabs and tracheal wash fluid. Cytologic examination of tracheal wash fluid revealed necrosis, and viral RNA was detected in necrotic cells by in situ hybridization, confirming virus-associated tissue damage. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from the tracheal wash fluid of the index case, as well as the feces from one Amur tiger and one lion. Fecal viral RNA shedding was confirmed in all seven clinical cases and an asymptomatic Amur tiger. Respiratory signs abated within 1-5 days for most animals, though persisted intermittently for 16 days in the index case. Fecal RNA shedding persisted for as long as 35 days beyond cessation of respiratory signs. This case series describes the clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of tigers and lions infected with SARS-CoV-2, and describes the duration of viral RNA fecal shedding in these cases. This report documents the first known natural transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to animals in the USA, and is the first report of SARS-CoV-2 in non-domestic felids.",

    "abstract": "Background Hospital emergency departments play a crucial role in the initial management of suspected COVID-19 infection. We aimed to characterise patients attending emergency departments with suspected COVID-19, including subgroups based on sex, ethnicity and COVID-19 test results. Methods We undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 70 emergency departments across the United Kingdom (UK). We collected presenting data from 22446 people attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020. Outcomes were admission to hospital, COVID-19 result, organ support (respiratory, cardiovascular or renal), and death, by record review at 30 days. Results Adults were acutely unwell (median NEWS2 score 4) and had high rates of admission (67.1%), COVID-19 positivity (31.2%), organ support (9.8%) and death (15.9%). Children had much lower rates of admission (27.4%), COVID-19 positivity (1.2%), organ support (1.4%) and death (0.3%). Adult men and women presented in similar numbers (10210 versus 10506), but men were more likely to be admitted (72.9% v 61.4%), require organ support (12.2% v 7.7%) and die (18.7% v 13.3%). Black or Asian adults tended to be younger than White adults (median age 54, 50 and 67 years), were less likely to be admitted (60.8%, 57.3%, 69.6%) or die (11.9%, 11.2%, 16.8%), but were more likely to require organ support (15.9%, 14.3%, 8.9%) or have a positive COVID-19 test (40.8%, 42.1%, 30.0%). Adults admitted with confirmed COVID-19 had similar age and comorbidities (except chronic lung disease) to those who did not have COVID-19 confirmed, but were much more likely to need organ support (22.2% v 8.9%) or die (32.7% v 15.9%). Conclusions Important differences exist between patient groups presenting to the emergency department with suspected COVID-19. People with confirmed COVID-19 have a poor prognosis, compared with similar emergency admissions without confirmed COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Background: Recent studies suggested a link between long-term exposure to air-pollution and COVID-19 mortality. However, due to their ecological design, based on large spatial units, they neglect the strong localised air-pollution patterns, and potentially lead to inadequate confounding adjustment. We investigated the effect of long-term exposure to NO2 and PM2.5 on COVID-19 deaths up to June 30, 2020 in England using high geographical resolution. Methods: We included 38 573 COVID-19 deaths up to June 30, 2020 at the Lower Layer Super Output Area level in England (n=32 844 small areas). We retrieved averaged NO2 and PM2.5 concentration during 2014-2018 from the Pollution Climate Mapping. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to quantify the effect of air-pollution while adjusting for a series of confounding and spatial autocorrelation. Findings: We find a 0.5% (95% credible interval: -0.2%-1.2%) and 1.4% (-2.1%-5.1%) increase in COVID-19 mortality rate for every 1g/m3 increase in NO2 and PM2.5 respectively, after adjusting for confounding and spatial autocorrelation. This corresponds to a posterior probability of a positive effect of 0.93 and 0.78 respectively. The spatial relative risk at LSOA level revealed strong patterns, similar for the different pollutants. This potentially captures the spread of the disease during the first wave of the epidemic. Interpretation: Our study provides some evidence of an effect of long-term NO2 exposure on COVID-19 mortality, while the effect of PM2.5 remains more uncertain.

    "abstract": "Background Measurement of post-exertion oxygen saturation has been proposed to assess illness severity in suspected COVID-19 infection. We aimed to determine the accuracy of post-exertional oxygen saturation for predicting adverse outcome in suspected COVID-19. Methods We undertook an observational cohort study across 70 emergency departments during first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. We collected data prospectively, using a standardised assessment form, and retrospectively, using hospital records, from patients with suspected COVID-19, and reviewed hospital records at 30 days for adverse outcome (death or receiving organ support). Patients with post-exertion oxygen saturation recorded were selected for this analysis. Results We analysed data from 817 patients with post-exertion oxygen saturation recorded after excluding 54 in whom measurement appeared unfeasible. The c-statistic for post-exertion change in oxygen saturation was 0.589 (95% confidence interval 0.465 to 0.713), and the positive and negative likelihood ratios of a 3% or more desaturation were respectively 1.78 (1.25 to 2.53) and 0.67 (0.46 to 0.98). Multivariable analysis showed that post-exertion oxygen saturation was not a significant predictor of adverse outcome when baseline clinical assessment was taken into account (p=0.368). Secondary analysis excluding patients in whom post-exertion measurement appeared inappropriate resulted in a c-statistic of 0.699 (0.581 to 0.817), likelihood ratios of 1.98 (1.26 to 3.10) and 0.61 (0.35 to 1.07), and some evidence of additional prognostic value on multivariable analysis (p=0.019). Conclusions Post-exertion oxygen saturation provides modest prognostic information in the assessment of patients attending the emergency department with suspected COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Background: It is unclear whether HIV infection is associated with risk of COVID-19 death. We aimed to investigate this in a large-scale population-based study in England. Methods: Working on behalf of NHS England, we used the OpenSAFELY platform to analyse routinely collected electronic primary care data linked to national death registrations. People with a primary care record for HIV infection were compared to people without HIV. COVID-19 death was defined by ICD-10 codes U07.1 or U07.2 anywhere on the death certificate. Cox regression models were used to estimate the association between HIV infection and COVID-19 death, initially adjusted for age and sex, then adding adjustment for index of multiple deprivation and ethnicity, and finally for a broad range of comorbidities. Interaction terms were added to assess effect modification by age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities and calendar time. Results: 17.3 million adults were included, of whom 27,480 (0.16%) had HIV recorded. People living with HIV were more likely to be male, of black ethnicity, and from a more deprived geographical area than the general population. There were 14,882 COVID-19 deaths during the study period, with 25 among people with HIV. People living with HIV had nearly three-fold higher risk of COVID-19 death than those without HIV after adjusting for age and sex (HR=2.90, 95% CI 1.96-4.30). The association was attenuated but risk remained substantially raised, after adjustment for deprivation and ethnicity (adjusted HR=2.52, 1.70-3.73) and further adjustment for comorbidities (HR=2.30, 1.55-3.41). There was some evidence that the association was larger among people of black ethnicity (HR = 3.80, 2.15-6.74, compared to 1.64, 0.92-2.90 in non-black individuals, p-interaction=0.045) Interpretation: HIV infection was associated with a markedly raised risk of COVID-19 death in a country with high levels of antiretroviral therapy coverage and viral suppression; the association was larger in people of black ethnicity.",

    "abstract": "Background The mortality of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19 is unclear due to variable censoring and substantial proportions of undischarged patients at follow-up. Nationwide data have not been previously reported. We studied the outcomes of Swedish patients at 30 days after ICU admission. Methods We conducted a registry-based cohort study of all adult patients admitted to Swedish ICUs from 6 March-6 May, 2020 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 disease and complete 30-day follow-up. Data including baseline characteristics, comorbidities, intensive care treatments, organ failures and outcomes were collected. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. A multivariable model was used to determine the independent association between potential predictor variables and the primary outcome. Results A total of 1563 patients were identified. Median ICU length of stay was 12 (5-21) days, and fifteen patients remained in ICU at the time of follow-up. Median age was 61 (52-69), median Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS III) was 53 (46-59), and 66.8% had at least one comorbidity. Median PaO2/FiO2 on admission was 97.5 (75.0-140.6) mmHg, 74.7% suffered from moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The 30-day all-cause mortality was 26.7%. The majority of deaths occurred during ICU admission. Age, male sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.5 [1.1-2.1]), SAPS III score (aOR 1.3 [1.2-1.4]), severe ARDS (aOR 3.1 [2.0-4.8], specific COVID-19 pharmacotherapy (aOR 1.4 [1.0-1.9]), and CRRT (aOR 2.2 [1.6-3.0]), were associated with increased mortality. With the exception of chronic lung disease, the presence of comorbidities was not independently associated with mortality. Conclusions Thirty-day mortality rate in COVID-19 patients admitted to Swedish intensive care units is generally lower than previously reported. Mortality appears to be driven by age, baseline disease severity, the degree of organ failure and ICU treatment, rather than preexisting comorbidities.",

    "abstract": "Background Large-scale school closures have been implemented worldwide to curb the spread of COVID-19. However, the impact of school closures and re-opening on epidemic dynamics remains unclear. Methods We simulated COVID-19 transmission dynamics using an individual-based stochastic model, incorporating social-contact data of school-aged children during shelter-in-place orders derived from Bay Area (California) household surveys. We simulated transmission under observed conditions and counterfactual intervention scenarios between March 17-June 1, and evaluated various fall 2020 K-12 reopening strategies. Findings Between March 17-June 1, assuming children <10 were half as susceptible to infection as older children and adults, we estimated school closures averted a similar number of infections (13,842 cases; 95% CI: 6,290, 23,040) as workplace closures (15,813; 95% CI: 9,963, 22,617) and social distancing measures (7,030; 95% CI: 3,118, 11,676). School closure effects were driven by high school and middle school closures. Under assumptions of moderate community transmission, we estimate that fall 2020 school reopenings will increase symptomatic illness among high school teachers (an additional 40.7% expected to experience symptomatic infection, 95% CI: 1.9, 61.1), middle school teachers (37.2%, 95% CI: 4.6, 58.1), and elementary school teachers (4.1%, 95% CI: -1.7, 12.0). Results are highly dependent on uncertain parameters, notably the relative susceptibility and infectiousness of children, and extent of community transmission amid re-opening. The school-based interventions needed to reduce the risk to fewer than an additional 1% of teachers infected varies by grade level. A hybrid-learning approach with halved class sizes of 10 students may be needed in high schools, while maintaining small cohorts of 20 students may be needed for elementary schools. Interpretation Multiple in-school intervention strategies and community transmission reductions, beyond the extent achieved to date, will be necessary to avoid undue excess risk associated with school reopening. Policymakers must urgently enact policies that curb community transmission and implement within-school control measures to simultaneously address the tandem health crises posed by COVID-19 and adverse child health and development consequences of long-term school closures.",

    "abstract": "Objective To determine the association between pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders and the risk of COVID-19. Design Community-based prospective cohort study. Setting UK Biobank population. Participants 421,048 participants who were recruited in England and alive by January 31st 2020, i.e., the start of COVID-19 outbreak in the UK. 50,815 individuals with psychiatric disorders recorded in the UK Biobank inpatient hospital data before the outbreak were included in the exposed group, while 370,233 participants without such conditions were in the unexposed group. Measurements We obtained information on positive results of COVID-19 test as registered in the Public Health England, COVID-19 related hospitalizations in the UK Biobank inpatient hospital data, and COIVD-19 related deaths from the death registers. We also identified individuals who was hospitalized for infections other than COVID-19 during the follow-up. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), controlling for multiple confounders. Results The mean age at outbreak was 67.8 years and around 43% of the study participants were male. We observed an elevated risk of COVID-19 among individuals with pre-pandemic psychiatric disorder, compared with those without such diagnoses. The fully adjusted ORs were 1.44 (95%CI 1.27 to 1.64), 1.67 (1.42 to 1.98), and 2.03 (1.56 to 2.63) for any COVID-19, inpatient COVID-19, COVID-19 related death, respectively. The excess risk was observed across all levels of somatic comorbidities and subtypes of pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders, while further increased with greater number of pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders. We also observed an association between pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders and increased risk of hospitalization for other infections (1.85 [1.65 to 2.07]). Conclusions Pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders are associated with increased risk of COVID-19, especially severe and fatal COVID-19. The similar association observed for hospitalization for other infections suggests a shared pathway between psychiatric disorders and different infections, including altered immune responses.",

    "abstract": "In order to prepare for and control the continued spread of the COVID-19 pandemic while minimizing its economic impact, the world needs to be able to estimate and predict COVID-19's spread. Unfortunately, we cannot directly observe the prevalence or growth rate of COVID-19; these must be inferred using some kind of model. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian extension to the classic susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartmental model that adds compartments to account for isolation and death and allows the infection rate to vary as a function of both mobility data collected from mobile phones and a latent time-varying factor that accounts for changes in behavior not captured by mobility data. Since confirmed-case data is unreliable, we infer the model's parameters conditioned on deaths data. We replace the exponential-waiting-time assumption of classic compartmental models with Erlang distributions, which allows for a more realistic model of the long lag between exposure and death. The mobility data gives us a leading indicator that can quickly detect changes in the pandemic's local growth rate and forecast changes in death rates weeks ahead of time. This is an analysis of observational data, so any causal interpretations of the model's inferences should be treated as suggestive at best; nonetheless, the model's inferred relationship between different kinds of trips and the infection rate do suggest some possible hypotheses about what kinds of activities might contribute most to COVID-19's spread.",

    "abstract": "Control of the COVID-19 pandemic requires a detailed understanding of prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the population. Case-based surveillance is necessarily biased towards symptomatic individuals and sensitive to varying patterns of reporting in space and time. The real-time assessment of community transmission antigen study (REACT-1) is designed to overcome these limitations by obtaining prevalence data based on a nose and throat swab RT-PCR test among a representative community-based sample in England, including asymptomatic individuals. Here, we describe results comparing rounds 1 and 2 carried out during May and mid June / early July 2020 respectively across 315 lower tier local authority areas. In round 1 we found 159 positive samples from 120,620 tested swabs while round 2 there were 123 positive samples from 159,199 tested swabs, indicating a downwards trend in prevalence from 0.13% (95% CI, 0.11%, 0.15%) to 0.077% (0.065%, 0.092%), a halving time of 38 (28, 58) days, and an R of 0.89 (0.86, 0.93). The proportion of swab-positive participants who were asymptomatic at the time of sampling increased from 69% (61%, 76%) in round 1 to 81% (73%, 87%) in round 2. Although health care and care home workers were infected far more frequently than other workers in round 1, the odds were markedly reduced in round 2. Age patterns of infection changed between rounds, with a reduction by a factor of five in prevalence in 18 to 24 year olds. Our data were suggestive of increased risk of infection in Black and Asian (mainly South Asian) ethnicities. Using regional and detailed case location data, we detected increased infection intensity in and near London. Under multiple sensitivity analyses, our results were robust to the possibility of false positives. At the end of the initial lockdown in England, we found continued decline in prevalence and a shift in the pattern of infection by age and occupation. Community-based sampling, including asymptomatic individuals, is necessary to fully understand the nature of ongoing transmission.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Many healthcare staff work in high-risk settings for contracting and transmitting Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. Their risk of hospitalisation for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and that of their households, is poorly understood. Design and settings and participants: During the peak period for COVID-19 infection in Scotland (1st March 2020 to 6th June 2020) we conducted a national record linkage study to compare the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation among healthcare workers (age: 18-65 years), their households and other members of the general population. Main outcome: Hospitalisation with COVID-19 Results: The cohort comprised 158,445 healthcare workers, the majority being patient facing (90,733 / 158,445; 57.3%), and 229,905 household members. Of all COVID-19 hospitalisations in the working age population (18-65-year-old), 17.2% (360 / 2,097) were in healthcare workers or their households. Adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, socio-economic deprivation and comorbidity, the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation in non-patient facing healthcare workers and their households was similar to the risk in the general population (hazards ratio [HR] 0.81; 95%CI 0.52-1.26 and 0.86; 95%CI 0.49-1.51 respectively). In models adjusting for the same covariates however, patient facing healthcare workers, compared to non-patient facing healthcare workers, were at higher risk (HR 3.30; 95%CI 2.13-5.13); so too were household members of patient facing healthcare workers (HR 1.79; 95%CI 1.10-2.91). On sub-dividing patient-facing healthcare workers into those who worked in front-door, intensive care and non-intensive care aerosol generating settings and other, those in front door roles were at higher risk (HR 2.09; 95%CI 1.49-2.94). For most patient facing healthcare workers and their households, the estimated absolute risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation was less than 0.5% but was 1% and above in older men with comorbidity. Conclusions: Healthcare workers and their households contribute a sixth of hospitalised COVID-19 cases. Whilst the absolute risk of hospitalisation was low overall, patient facing healthcare workers and their households had 3- and 2-fold increased risks of COVID-19 hospitalisation.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: To estimate population-level associations between ethnicity and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality, and to investigate how ethnicity-specific mortality risk evolved over the course of the pandemic. Design: Retrospective cohort study using linked administrative data. Setting: England and Wales, deaths occurring 2 March to 15 May 2020. Participants: Respondents to the 2011 Census of England and Wales aged [&le;]100 years and enumerated in private households, linked to death registrations and adjusted to account for emigration before the outcome period, who were alive on 1 March 2020 (n=47,872,412). Main outcome measure: Death related to COVID-19, registered by 29 May 2020. Statistical methods: We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for ethnic minority groups compared with the White population using Cox regression models, controlling for geographical, demographic, socio-economic, occupational, and self-reported health factors. HRs were estimated on the full outcome period and separately for pre- and post-lockdown periods in the UK. Results: In the age-adjusted models, people from all ethnic minority groups were at elevated risk of COVID-19 mortality; the HRs for Black males and females were 3.13 [95% confidence interval: 2.93 to 3.34] and 2.40 [2.20 to 2.61] respectively. However, in the fully adjusted model for females, the HRs were close to unity for all ethnic groups except Black (1.29 [1.18 to 1.42]). For males, COVID-19 mortality risk remained elevated for the Black (1.76 [1.63 to 1.90]), Bangladeshi/Pakistani (1.35 [1.21 to 1.49]) and Indian (1.30 [1.19 to 1.43]) groups. The HRs decreased after lockdown for all ethnic groups, particularly Black and Bangladeshi/Pakistani females. Conclusions: Differences in COVID-19 mortality between ethnic groups were largely attenuated by geographical and socio-economic factors, although some residual differences remained. Lockdown was associated with reductions in excess mortality risk in ethnic minority populations, which has major implications for a second wave of infection or local spikes. Further research is needed to understand the causal mechanisms underpinning observed differences in COVID-19 mortality between ethnic groups.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is spreading widely across the globe right now. Majority of the countries are relying on models and studies such as stochastic simulations, AceMod model, neural networks-based models, exponential growth model,Weibull distribution model, and so on to forecast the number of COVID-19 cases in the coming months. The objective on utilizing these models is to ensure that strict measures can be enacted to contain the virus spread and also predict the resources required to deal with the pandemic as the disease spreads. In the past few months, several models were used to predict the infection rate for COVID-19. These models predicted the infection rates, recovery rate or death rates for the COVID-19 patients. All these different models took different approaches and different scenarios to predict the future rates. Now, that we know the real cases, we can check how accurate these models were. Some of these models were able to predict the near future quite close to the reality but most of them went astray. In this study, we review major forecasting models that were used in the context of India during country-wise lockdown and compare them. From these comparisons, we can see that while the advanced warning can be helpful in mitigating and preparing for an impending or ongoing epidemic, effects can be catastrophic if poorly fitting models are used for predictions.",

    "abstract": "Introduction. Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. On March 2, 2020, Indonesia announced the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. East Kalimantan will play an important role as the new capital of Indonesia. There is attention to the preparedness of East Kalimantan to respond to COVID-19. We report the characteristics of COVID-19 fatality cases in here. Methods. We retrospectively analyzed the fatality cases of COVID-19 patients from the East Kalimantan Health Office information system. All patients were confirmed COVID-19 by RT-PCR examination. Results. By July 31, 2020, 31 fatality cases of patients had been identified as having confirmed COVID-19 in East Kalimantan. The mean age of the patients was 55.1 + 9.2 years. Most of the patients were men (22 [71.0%]) with age more than 60 years old (14 [45.2%]). Balikpapan has the highest number of COVID-19 fatality cases from all regencies. Hypertension was the most comorbidities in the fatality cases of COVID-19 patients in East Kalimantan. Discussion. Older age and comorbidities still contributed to the fatality cases of COVID-19 patients in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease were underlying conditions for increasing the risk of COVID-19 getting into a serious condition. Conclusion. Active surveillance for people older than 60 years old and having underlying diseases is needed for reducing the case fatality rate of COVID-19 in East Kalimantan. Keywords. Comorbidity, fatality cases, COVID-19, Indonesia.",

    "abstract": "Objectives To develop and validate a pragmatic risk score to predict mortality for patients admitted to hospital with covid-19. Design Prospective observational cohort study: ISARIC WHO CCP-UK study (ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium [4C]). Model training was performed on a cohort of patients recruited between 6 February and 20 May 2020, with validation conducted on a second cohort of patients recruited between 21 May and 29 June 2020. Setting 260 hospitals across England, Scotland, and Wales. Participants Adult patients ([&ge;]18 years) admitted to hospital with covid-19 admitted at least four weeks before final data extraction. Main outcome measures In-hospital mortality. Results There were 34 692 patients included in the derivation dataset (mortality rate 31.7%) and 22 454 in the validation dataset (mortality 31.5%). The final 4C Mortality Score included eight variables readily available at initial hospital assessment: age, sex, number of comorbidities, respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, level of consciousness, urea, and C-reactive protein (score range 0-21 points). The 4C risk stratification score demonstrated high discrimination for mortality (derivation cohort: AUROC 0.79; 95% CI 0.78 - 0.79; validation cohort 0.78, 0.77-0.79) with excellent calibration (slope = 1.0). Patients with a score [&ge;]15 (n = 2310, 17.4%) had a 67% mortality (i.e., positive predictive value 67%) compared with 1.0% mortality for those with a score [&le;]3 (n = 918, 7%; negative predictive value 99%). Discriminatory performance was higher than 15 pre-existing risk stratification scores (AUROC range 0.60-0.76), with scores developed in other covid-19 cohorts often performing poorly (range 0.63-0.73). Conclusions We have developed and validated an easy-to-use risk stratification score based on commonly available parameters at hospital presentation. This outperformed existing scores, demonstrated utility to directly inform clinical decision making, and can be used to stratify inpatients with covid-19 into different management groups. The 4C Mortality Score may help clinicians identify patients with covid-19 at high risk of dying during current and subsequent waves of the pandemic. Study registration ISRCTN66726260",

    "abstract": "Objectives: To determine the trend in mortality risk over time in people with severe COVID-19 requiring critical care (high intensive unit [HDU] or intensive care unit [ICU]) management. Methods: We accessed national English data on all adult COVID-19 specific critical care admissions from the COVID-19 Hospitalisation in England Surveillance System (CHESS), up to the 29th June 2020 (n=14,958). The study period was 1st March until 30th May, meaning every patient had 30 days of potential follow-up available. The primary outcome was in-hospital 30-day all-cause mortality. Hazard ratios for mortality were estimated for those admitted each week using a Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for age (non-linear restricted cubic spline), sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and geographical region. Results: 30-day mortality peaked for people admitted to critical care in early April (peak 29.1% for HDU, 41.5% for ICU). There was subsequently a sustained decrease in mortality risk until the end of the study period. As a linear trend from the first week of April, adjusted mortality risk decreased by 11.2% (adjusted HR 0.89 [95% CI 0.87 - 0.91]) per week in HDU, and 9.0% (adjusted HR 0.91 [95% CI 0.88 - 0.94]) in ICU. Conclusions: There has been a substantial mortality improvement in people admitted to critical care with COVID-19 in England, with markedly lower mortality in people admitted in mid-April and May compared to earlier in the pandemic. This trend remains after adjustment for patient demographics and comorbidities suggesting this improvement is not due to changing patient characteristics. Possible causes include the introduction of effective treatments as part of clinical trials and a falling critical care burden.",

    "abstract": "Dexamethasone has been shown to reduce mortality in hospitalised COVID-19 patients needing oxygen and ventilation by 18% and 36%, respectively. Here, we estimate the potential number of lives saved and life years gained if this treatment would be rolled out in the UK and globally, as well as its cost-effectiveness of implementing this intervention. We estimate that, for the UK, approximately 12,000 [4,250 - 27,000] lives could be saved by January 2021. Assuming that dexamethasone has a similar effect size in settings where access to oxygen therapies is limited, this would translate into approximately 650,000 [240,000 - 1,400,000] lives saved globally. If dexamethasone acts differently in these settings, the impact could be less than half of this value. To estimate the full potential of dexamethasone in the global fight against COVID-19, it is essential to perform clinical research in settings with limited access to oxygen and/or ventilators, e.g. in low and middle-income countries.",

    "abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic affects mortality directly through infection as well as through changes in the social, environmental and healthcare determinants of health. The impacts on mortality are likely to vary across countries in magnitude, timing, and age and sex composition. Here, we applied an ensemble of 16 Bayesian probabilistic models to vital statistics data, by age group and sex, to consistently and comparably estimate the impacts of the first phase of the pandemic on all-cause mortality for 17 industrialised countries. The models accounted for factors that affect death rates including seasonality, temperature, and public holidays, as well as for medium-long-term secular trends and the dependency of death rates in each week on those in preceding week(s). From mid-February through the end of May 2020, an estimated 202,900 (95% credible interval 179,400-224,900) more people died in these 17 countries than would have had the pandemic not taken place. Nearly three quarters of these excess deaths occurred in England and Wales, Italy and Spain, where less than half of the total population of these countries live. When all-cause mortality is considered, the total number of deaths, deaths per 100,000 people, and relative increase in deaths were similar between men and women in most countries. Further, in many countries, the balance of excess deaths changed from male-dominated early in the pandemic to being equal or female-dominated later on. Taken over the entire first phase of the pandemic, there was no detectable rise in all-cause mortality in New Zealand, Bulgaria, Hungary, Norway, Denmark and Finland and for women in Austria and Switzerland (posterior probability of an increase in deaths <90%). Women in Portugal and men in Austria experienced relatively small increases in all-cause mortality, with posterior probabilities of 90-99%. For men in Switzerland and Portugal, and both sexes in the Netherlands, France, Sweden, Belgium, Italy, Scotland, Spain and England and Wales, all-cause mortality increased as a result of the pandemic with a posterior probability >99%. After accounting for population size, England and Wales and Spain experienced the highest death toll, nearly 100 deaths per 100,000 people; they also had the largest relative (percent) increase in deaths (37% (95% credible interval 30-44) in England and Wales; 38% (31-44) in Spain). New Zealand, Bulgaria, Hungary, Norway, Denmark and Finland experienced changes in deaths that ranged from possible slight declines to increases of no more than 5%. The large impact in England and Wales stems partly from having experienced (together with Spain) the highest weekly increases in deaths, more than doubling in some weeks, and having had (together with Sweden) the longest duration when deaths exceeded levels that would be expected in the absence of the pandemic. The heterogeneous magnitude and character of the excess deaths due to the Covid-19 pandemic reflect differences in how well countries have managed the pandemic (e.g., timing, extent and adherence to lockdowns and other social distancing measures; effectiveness of test, trace and isolate mechanisms), and the resilience and preparedness of the health and social care system (e.g., effective facility and community care pathways; minimising spread of infection within hospitals and care homes, and between them and the community).",

    "abstract": "Background The number of proposed prognostic models for COVID-19, which aim to predict disease outcomes, is growing rapidly. It is not known whether any are suitable for widespread clinical implementation. We addressed this question by independent and systematic evaluation of their performance among hospitalised COVID-19 cases. Methods We conducted an observational cohort study to assess candidate prognostic models, identified through a living systematic review. We included consecutive adults admitted to a secondary care hospital with PCR-confirmed or clinically diagnosed community-acquired COVID-19 (1st February to 30th April 2020). We reconstructed candidate models as per their original descriptions and evaluated performance for their original intended outcomes (clinical deterioration or mortality) and time horizons. We assessed discrimination using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and calibration using calibration plots, slopes and calibration-in-the-large. We calculated net benefit compared to the default strategies of treating all and no patients, and against the most discriminating predictor in univariable analyses, based on a limited subset of a priori candidates. Results We tested 22 candidate prognostic models among a cohort of 411 participants, of whom 180 (43.8%) and 115 (28.0%) met the endpoints of clinical deterioration and mortality, respectively. The highest AUROCs were achieved by the NEWS2 score for prediction of deterioration over 24 hours (0.78; 95% CI 0.73-0.83), and a novel model for prediction of deterioration <14 days from admission (0.78; 0.74-0.82). Calibration appeared generally poor for models that used probability outcomes. In univariable analyses, admission oxygen saturation on room air was the strongest predictor of in-hospital deterioration (AUROC 0.76; 0.71-0.81), while age was the strongest predictor of in-hospital mortality (AUROC 0.76; 0.71-0.81). No prognostic model demonstrated consistently higher net benefit than using the most discriminating univariable predictors to stratify treatment, across a range of threshold probabilities. Conclusions Oxygen saturation on room air and patient age are strong predictors of deterioration and mortality among hospitalised adults with COVID-19, respectively. None of the prognostic models evaluated offer incremental value for patient stratification to these univariable predictors.",

    "abstract": "Background: Italy was the first country outside China to experience the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a significant health burden. This study presents an analysis of the excess mortality across the 107 Italian provinces, stratified by sex, age group, and period of the outbreak. Methods: The analysis was performed using a two-stage interrupted time series design using daily mortality data for the period January 2015 - May 2020. In the first stage, we performed province-level quasi-Poisson regression models, with smooth functions to define a baseline risk while accounting for trends and weather conditions and to flexibly estimate the variation in excess risk during the outbreak. Estimates were pooled in the second stage using a mixed-effects multivariate meta-analysis. Results: In the period 15 February - 15 May 2020, we estimated an excess of 47,490 (95% empirical confidence intervals: 43,984 to 50,362) deaths in Italy, corresponding to an increase of 29.5% (95%eCI: 26.8 to 31.9%) from the expected mortality. The analysis indicates a strong geographical pattern, with the majority of excess deaths occurring in northern regions, where few provinces experienced up to 800% increase during the peak in late March. There were differences by sex, age, and area both in the overall impact and in its temporal distribution. Conclusions: This study offers a detailed picture of excess mortality during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. The strong geographical and temporal patterns can be related to implementation of lockdown policies and multiple direct and indirect pathways in mortality risk.",

    "abstract": "Rationale: The impact of COVID-19 on patients with Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) has not been established. Objectives: To assess outcomes following COVID-19 in patients with ILD versus those without in a contemporaneous age, sex and comorbidity matched population. Methods: An international multicentre audit of patients with a prior diagnosis of ILD admitted to hospital with COVID-19 between 1 March and 1 May 2020 was undertaken and compared with patients, without ILD obtained from the ISARIC 4C cohort, admitted with COVID-19 over the same period. The primary outcome was survival. Secondary analysis distinguished IPF from non-IPF ILD and used lung function to determine the greatest risks of death. Measurements and Main Results: Data from 349 patients with ILD across Europe were included, of whom 161 were admitted to hospital with laboratory or clinical evidence of COVID-19 and eligible for propensity-score matching. Overall mortality was 49% (79/161) in patients with ILD with COVID-19. After matching ILD patients with COVID-19 had higher mortality (HR 1.60, Confidence Intervals 1.17-2.18 p=0.003) compared with age, sex and co-morbidity matched controls without ILD. Patients with a Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) of <80% had an increased risk of death versus patients with FVC [&ge;]80% (HR 1.72, 1.05-2.83). Furthermore, obese patients with ILD had an elevated risk of death (HR 1.98, 1.13-3.46). Conclusions: Patients with ILD are at increased risk of death from COVID-19, particularly those with poor lung function and obesity. Stringent precautions should be taken to avoid COVID-19 in patients with ILD.",

    "abstract": "Hyperinflammation and uncontrolled cytokine release in infections and autoimmune diseases require therapy to reduce the innate immune response. Here, we present first in-human data showing reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine release with ultrasound stimulation of the spleen in healthy subjects and in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Single cell RNA sequencing reveals a decrease in IL-1{beta} and IL-8 transcript levels in circulating monocytes. There is also a down regulation of pathways involved in TNF and IL-6 production, and genes regulated by IFN and NF{kappa}B. Additional pre-clinical studies reveal that ultrasound can boost B cell activation and antibody production. Splenic ultrasound offers a new non-invasive therapy for treating hyperinflammation without compromising the adaptive immune response",

    "abstract": "Objective: To report three patients infected with COVID-19 with severe respiratory syndrome requiring intubation, who developed acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Method: Patient data were obtained from medical records from the North Memorial Health Hospital, Robbinsdale, MN, USA Results: Three patients (two men and one woman, aged 38 - 63) presented with fatigue, cough and fever leading to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to COVID-19 infection requiring intubation and ventilatory support. Two patients were unresponsive, one with strong eye deviation to the left and the third patient had severe diffuse weakness. MRI in all patients showed findings consistent with ADEM. CSF showed elevated protein in all patients with normal cell count and no evidence of infection, including negative COVID-19 PCR. All three of the patients received Convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19. All patients were treated with intravenous corticosteroids and improved, although two responded minimally. Two patients treated with IVIG showed no further improvement. Conclusion: Neurological complications from COVID-19 are being rapidly recognized. Our three cases highlight the occurrence of ADEM as a postinfectious/immune mediated complication of COVID-19 infection, which may be responsive to corticosteroid treatment. Early recognition of this complication and treatment is important to avoid long term complications.",

    "abstract": "(1) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic poses substantial threats to Latinx farmworkers and other immigrants in food production and processing. Classified as essential, such workers cannot shelter at home. Therefore, knowledge and preventive behaviors are important to reduce COVID-19 spread in the community. (2) Methods: Respondents for 67 families with at least one farmworker (FWF) and 38 comparable families with no farmworkers (non-FWF) in North Carolina completed a telephone survey in May, 2020. The survey queried knowledge of COVID-19, perceptions of its severity, self-efficacy, and preventive behaviors. Detailed data were collected to document household members' social interaction and use of face coverings. (3) Results: Knowledge of COVID-19 and prevention methods was high in both groups, as was its perceived severity. Non-FWF had higher self-efficacy for preventing infection. Both groups claimed to practice preventive behaviors, though FWF emphasized social avoidance and non-FWF emphasized personal hygiene. Detailed social interactions showed high rates of inter-personal contact at home, at work, and in the community with more mask use in non-FWF than FWF. (4) Conclusions: Despite high levels of knowledge and perceived severity for COVID-19, these immigrant families were engaged in frequent interpersonal contact that could expose community members and themselves to COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "A global analysis of the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the dynamics of the spread of the COVID-19 indicates that these can be classified using the stringency index proposed by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker(OxCGRT) team. The world average for the coefficient that linearises the level of transmission with respect to the OxCGRT stringency index is s= 0.01{+/-}0.0017 (95%C.I.). The corresponding South African coefficient is s= 0.0078{+/-}0.00036 (95%C.I.), compatible with the world average. Here, we implement the stringency index for the recently announced 5-tier regulatory alert system. Predictions are made for the spread of the virus for each alert level. Assuming constant rates of recovery and mortality, it is essential to increase s. For the system to remain sub-critical, the rate with which s increases should outpace that of the decrease of the stringency index. Monitoring of s becomes essential to controlling the post-lockdown phase. Data from the Gauteng province obtained in May 2020 has been used to re-calibrate the model, where s was found increase by 20% with respect to the period before lockdown. Predictions for the province are made in this light.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionSchool closures have been part of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic control measures in many countries, based on the assumption that children play a similar role in transmitting SARS-CoV-2 as they do in transmitting influenza virus. The contribution of schools in driving the pandemic, however, is still unclear. We therefore performed a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study in students and teachers at two time points in June and October 2020, respectively.\n\nMethodsStudents grade 8-11 and their teachers in 13 secondary schools in eastern Saxony, Germany, were invited to participate in the SchoolCoviDD19 study. Blood samples were collected in May/June 2020 after the reopening of the schools following the March 2020 lockdown, and again in September/October 2020, 4 weeks after the end of the summer holidays. SARS-CoV-2 IgG were assed using chemiluminescence immunoassay technology and all samples with a positive or equivocal test result were retested with two additional serological tests.\n\nResults1538 students and 507 teachers were initially enrolled, and 1334 students and 445 teachers completed both study visits. The seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 0.6% in May/June and the same in September/October. Even in schools with reported Covid-19 cases before the lockdown of March 13th no clusters could be identified. Of 12 persons with positive serology 5 had a known history of confirmed COVID-19; 23 out of 24 participants with a household history of COVID-91 were seronegative. By using a combination of three different immunoassays we could exclude 16 participants with a positive or equivocal results after initial testing.\n\nConclusionsSchools do not play a crucial role in driving the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a low prevalence setting. Transmission in families occurs very infrequently, and the number of unreported cases is low in this age group. These observations do not support school closures as a strategy fighting the pandemic in a low prevalence setting.",

    "abstract": "Background. High number of SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests are available in different formats, detect different types of antibodies, and use different target proteins. Sensitivity of these tests varies and could be also related to clinical symptoms and testing time. Methods. Serum samples from 97 COVID-19 patients and 100 controls were tested with 9 antibody tests (SNIBE, Epitope, Euroimmun, Roche, Abbott, DiaSorin, Biosensor, LIPS N, and LIPS S-RBD). The results were analyzed in context of clinical data. Findings. Positivity rate was of tests was following: N-LIPS test (91.8% cases), Epitope (85.6%), Abbott and in-house LIPS S-RBD (both 84.5%), Roche (83.5%), Euroimmun (82.5%), DiaSorin (81.4%), SNIBE (70.1%), and Biosensor (64.9%). Agreement between tests varied (71-95%). Correlation between patient symptoms score and antibody value was test-dependent: varied from strongest in LIPS N (rho=0.41; p<0.001) to nonsignificant (LIPS S-RBD). Testing time from symptoms influenced sensitivity in some tests more than anothers. Interpretation. Sensitivity of tests varied highly and combination of different tests may improve it. Relation of results to symptoms and testing time was test-dependent. Thus, some antibody tests seems to be more sensitive to detect antibodies early and in asymptomatic patients than others. Funding. Study was funded by SYNLAB Estonia and Estonian Research Council grant PRG377.",

    "abstract": "Background: As the coronavirus cases continue to surge, the urgent need for universal testing to identify positive cases for effective containment of this highly contagious pandemic has become the center of attention worldwide. However, in spite of extensive discussions, very few places have even attempted to implement it. We evaluated the efficacy of widespread testing in creating a safe workplace in our healthcare community including staff and patients. Furthermore, we assessed the rate of new infections in patients undergoing electrophysiology (EP) procedure, to see if identification and exclusion of positive cases facilitated establishment of a risk-free operating environment. Methods: Universal testing was conducted in subjects with no symptoms of COVID-19 including patients and their caregivers and staff in our electrophysiology units along with the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) staff (n=1670) Results: Of 1670, 758 (45.4%) were EP patients, and the remaining 912 were caregivers, EMS staff and hospital staff from EP clinic and lab. Viral-RNA test revealed 64 (3.8%) positives in the population. A significant increase in the rate of positives was observed from April to June, 2020 (p=0.02). Procedures of positive cases (n=31) were postponed until they tested negative at retesting on day 14. Staff testing positive (n=33) were retested before going back to work after 2 weeks. Because of suspected exposure, 67 staff were retested and source was traced. No new infections were reported in patients during the hospital stay or within 2-weeks after the procedure. Conclusion: Universal testing to identify positive cases was helpful in creating and maintaining a safe working environment without exposing patients and staff to new infections in the EP unit at the hospital.",

    "abstract": "Importance. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a decline in admissions with cardiovascular (CV) emergencies. The fatal consequences of this are unknown. Objectives - To describe the place and causes of acute CV death during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design - Retrospective nationwide cohort. Setting - England and Wales. Participants - All adult (age [&ge;]18 years) acute CV deaths (n=580,972) between 1st January 2014 and 2nd June 2020. Exposure - The COVID-19 pandemic (defined as from the onset of the first COVID-19 death in England on 2nd March 2020). Main outcomes - Place (hospital, care home, home) and acute CV events directly contributing to death as stated on the first part of the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death. Results - After 2nd March 2020, there were 22,820 acute CV deaths of which 5.7% related to COVID-19, and an excess acute CV mortality of 1752 (+8%) compared with the expected daily deaths in the same period. Deaths in the community accounted for nearly half of all deaths during this period. Care homes had the greatest increase in excess acute CV deaths (1065, +40%), followed by deaths at home (1728, +34%) and in hospital (57, +0%). The most frequent cause of acute CV death during this period was stroke (8,290, 36.3%), followed by acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (5,532, 24.2%), heart failure (5,280, 23.1%), pulmonary embolism (2,067, 9.1%) and cardiac arrest (1,037, 4.5%). Deep vein thrombosis had the greatest increase in cause of excess acute CV death (18, +25%), followed pulmonary embolism (340, +19%) and stroke (782, +10%). The greatest cause of excess CV death in care homes was stroke (700, +48%), compared with cardiac arrest (80, +56%) at home, and pulmonary embolism (126, +14%) and cardiogenic shock (41, +14%) in hospital. Conclusions and relevance - The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an inflation in acute CV deaths above that expected for the time of year, nearly half of which occurred in the community. The most common cause of acute CV death was stroke followed by acute coronary syndrome and heart failure. This is key information to optimise messaging to the public and enable health resource planning.",

    "abstract": "Background: Rates of Covid-19 infection have declined in many countries, but outbreaks persist in residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) who are at high risk of severe outcomes. Epidemiological data from LTCFs are scarce. We used population-level active surveillance to estimate incidence of, and risk factors for Covid-19, and attributable mortality in elderly residents of LTCFs. Methods: Cohort study using individual-level electronic health records from 8,713 residents and daily counts of infection for 9,339 residents and 11,604 staff across 179 UK LTCFs. We modelled risk factors for infection and mortality using Cox proportional hazards and estimated attributable fractions. Findings: 2,075/9,339 residents developed Covid-19 symptoms (22.2% [95% confidence interval: 21.4%; 23.1%]), while 951 residents (10.2% [9.6%; 10.8%]) and 585 staff (5.0% [4.7%; 5.5%]) had laboratory confirmed infections. Confirmed infection incidence in residents and staff respectively was 152.6 [143.1; 162.6] and 62.3 [57.3; 67.5] per 100,000 person-days. 121/179 (67.6%) LTCFs had at least one Covid-19 infection or death. Lower staffing ratios and higher occupancy rates were independent risk factors for infection. 1,694 all-cause deaths occurred in 8,713 (19.4% [18.6%; 20.3%]) residents. 217 deaths occurred in 607 residents with confirmed infection (case-fatality rate: 35.7% [31.9%; 39.7%]). 567/1694 (33.5%) of all-cause deaths were attributable to Covid-19, 28.0% of which occurred in residents with laboratory-confirmed infection. The remainder of excess deaths occurred in asymptomatic or symptomatic residents in the context of limited testing for infection, suggesting substantial under-ascertainment. Interpretation: 1 in 5 residents had symptoms of infection during the pandemic, but many cases were not tested. Higher occupancy and lower staffing levels increase infection risk. Disease control measures should integrate active surveillance and testing with fundamental changes in staffing and care home occupancy to protect staff and residents from infection.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic in the UK was accompanied by excess all-cause mortality at a national level, only part of which was accounted for by known infections. Excess mortality has previously been described in people who had received care from the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM), a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in south London. The SLaM Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource receives 24-hourly updates from its full electronic health record, including regularly sourced national mortality on all past and present SLaM service users. The SLaM urban catchment has high levels of deprivation and is ethnically diverse, so the objective of the descriptive analyses reported in this manuscript was to compare mortality in SLaM service users from 16th March to 15th May 2020 to that for the same period in 2019 within specific ethnic groups: i) White British, ii) Other White, iii) Black African/Caribbean, iv) South Asian, v) Other, and vi) missing/not stated. For Black African/Caribbean patients (the largest minority ethnic group) this ratio was 3.33, compared to 2.47 for White British patients. Considering premature mortality (restricting to deaths below age 70), these ratios were 2.74 and 1.96 respectively. Ratios were also high for those from Other ethnic groups (2.63 for all mortality, 3.07 for premature mortality).",

    "abstract": "Background England has experienced one of the highest rates of confirmed COVID-19 mortality in the world. SARS-CoV-2 virus has circulated in hospitals, care homes and the community since January 2020. Our current epidemiological knowledge is largely informed by clinical cases with far less understanding of community transmission. Methods The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) study is a nationally representative prevalence survey of SARS-CoV-2 virus swab-positivity in the community in England. We recruited participants regardless of symptom status. Results We found 159 positives from 120,610 swabs giving an average prevalence of 0.13% (95% CI: 0.11%,0.15%) from 1st May to 1st June 2020. We showed decreasing prevalence with a halving time of 8.6 (6.2, 13.6) days, implying an overall reproduction number R of 0.57 (0.45, 0.72). Adults aged 18 to 24 yrs had the highest swab-positivity rates, while those >64 yrs had the lowest. Of the 126 participants who tested positive with known symptom status in the week prior to their swab, 39 reported symptoms while 87 did not, giving an estimate that 69% (61%,76%) of people were symptom-free for the 7 days prior testing positive in our community sample. Symptoms strongly associated with swab-positivity were: nausea and/or vomiting, diarrhoea, blocked nose, loss of smell, loss of taste, headache, chills and severe fatigue. Recent contact with a known COVID-19 case was associated with odds of 24 (16, 38) for swab-positivity. Compared with non-key workers, odds of swab-positivity were 7.7 (2.4, 25) among care home (long-term care facilities) workers and 5.2 (2.9, 9.3) among health care workers. However, some of the excess risk associated with key worker status was explained by recent contact with COVID-19 cases. We found no strong evidence for geographical variability in positive swab results. Conclusion Our results provide a reliable baseline against which the impact of subsequent relaxation of lockdown can be assessed to inform future public health efforts to control transmission.",

    "abstract": "Background: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic affects cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) directly through infection and indirectly through health service reorganisation and public health policy. Real-time data are needed to quantify direct and indirect effects. We aimed to monitor hospital activity for presentation, diagnosis and treatment of CVDs during the pandemic to inform on indirect effects. Methods: We analysed aggregate data on presentations, diagnoses and treatments or procedures for selected CVDs (acute coronary syndromes, heart failure, stroke and transient ischaemic attack, venous thromboembolism, peripheral arterial disease and aortic aneurysm) in UK hospitals before and during the COVID-19 epidemic. We produced an online visualisation tool to enable near real-time monitoring of trends. Findings: Nine hospitals across England and Scotland contributed hospital activity data from 28 Oct 2019 (pre-COVID-19) to 10 May 2020 (pre-easing of lockdown), and for the same weeks during 2018-2019. Across all hospitals, total admissions and emergency department (ED) attendances decreased after lockdown (23 March 2020) by 57.9% (57.1-58.6%) and 52.9% (52.2-53.5%) respectively compared with the previous year. Activity for cardiac, cerebrovascular and other vascular conditions started to decline 1-2 weeks before lockdown, and fell by 31-88% after lockdown, with the greatest reductions observed for coronary artery bypass grafts, carotid endarterectomy, aortic aneurysm repair and peripheral arterial disease procedures. Compared with before the first UK COVID-19 (31 January 2020), activity declined across diseases and specialties between the first case and lockdown (total ED attendances RR 0.94, 0.93-0.95; total hospital admissions RR 0.96, 0.95-0.97) and after lockdown (attendances RR 0.63, 0.62-0.64; admissions RR 0.59, 0.57-0.60). There was limited recovery towards usual levels of some activities from mid-April 2020. Interpretation: Substantial reductions in total and cardiovascular activities are likely to contribute to a major burden of indirect effects of the pandemic, suggesting they should be monitored and mitigated urgently.",

    "abstract": "ImportanceSARS-CoV-2 causes multiple immune-related reactions at various stages of the disease, and the wide variety of cutaneous presentations has delayed linking these to the virus. Previous studies had attempted to look at the prevalence and timing of COVID-19 rashes but were mostly based on hospitalized severe cases with limited follow up.\n\nObjectiveTo assess the diagnostic value of new skin rashes in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nDesignObservational study including data collected longitudinally via the COVID Symptom Study app between May 7th and June 22nd, 2020, as well as data from an independent online survey on skin-related symptoms.\n\nSettingCommunity-based\n\nParticipantsVolunteer sample of 336,847 UK users of the COVID Symptom Study app and 11,546 surveyees, aged 1 to 90 years old.\n\nExposureUsers self-reporting a positive or negative SARS-CoV-2 swab test result, untested symptomatic users, and survey respondents.\n\nMain Outcome(s) and Measure(s)the diagnostic value of new skin rashes in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and observation on their duration and timing in relation to other COVID-19 symptoms\n\nResultsIn the app data, 8.8% of the swab positive cases (N=2,021) reported either a body rash or an acral rash, compared to 5.4% of those with a negative swab test (N=25,136). Together, these two cutaneous presentations showed an odds ratio (OR) of 1.67 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.42-1.97) for being swab positive. Skin rashes were also predictive in the larger untested group of symptomatic app users (N=54,652), as 8.2% of those who had reported at least one classic COVID-19 symptom, i.e., fever, persistent cough, and/or anosmia, also reported a rash. Data from the independent online survey showed that in 17% of swab positive cases, the rash was the initial presentation. Furthermore, in 21%, the rash was the only clinical sign.\n\nConclusions and RelevanceSkin rashes cluster with other COVID-19 symptoms, are predictive of a positive swab test and occur in a significant number of cases, either alone or before other symptoms. Recognising rashes is important for the early detection of COVID-19 cases. To help healthcare professionals in this task we have established a large library of high-quality manually curated photos, available at: https://covidskinsigns.com\n\nKey points\n\nQuestionWhat is the diagnostiv value of the cutaneous manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection?\n\nFindingsWe confirmed, in a community-based setting, that the presence of a rash is predictive of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and provided a large library of cutaneous manifestation photos to help healthcare professionals in diagnosing COVID-19.\n\nMeaningSkin rashes should be considered as part of the clinical presentation of COVID-19 to aid earlier diagnosis and curb the spread of the infection.",

We conducted a case-control study of 872 inner city adult residents admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 (cases) and 3,488 matched controls randomly sampled from a primary healthcare database comprising 344,083 people resident in the same region. To examine in-hospital mortality, we conducted a cohort study of 1827 adults consecutively admitted with COVID-19. Data collected included hospital admission for COVID-19, demographics, comorbidities, in-hospital mortality. The primary exposure variable was self-defined ethnicity. Results. The 872 cases comprised 48.1% Black, 33.7% White, 12.6% Mixed/Other and 5.6% Asian patients. In conditional logistic regression analyses, Black and Mixed/Other ethnicity were associated with higher admission risk than white (OR 3.12 [95% CI 2.63-3.71] and 2.97 [2.30- 3.85] respectively). Adjustment for comorbidities and deprivation modestly attenuated the association (OR 2.28 [1.87-2.79] for Black, 2.66 [2.01-3.52] for Mixed/Other). Asian ethnicity was not associated with higher admission risk (OR 1.20 [0.86-1.66]). In the cohort study of 1827 patients, 455 (28.9%) died over a median (IQR) of 8 (4-16) days. Age and male sex, but not Black (adjusted HR 0.84 [0.63-1.11]) or Mixed/Other ethnicity (adjusted HR 0.69 [0.43-1.10]), were associated with in-hospital mortality. Asian ethnicity was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (adjusted HR 1.54 [0.98-2.41]). Conclusions. Black and Mixed ethnicity are independently associated with greater admission risk with COVID-19 and may be risk factors for development of severe disease. Comorbidities and socioeconomic factors only partly account for this and additional ethnicity-related factors may play a large role. The impact of COVID-19 may be different in Asians.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: First, to describe adolescents' health information sources and knowledge, health literacy (HL), health protective measures, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) during the initial phase of the Covid-19 pandemic in Norway. Second, to investigate the association between HL and the knowledge and behavior relevant for preventing spread of the virus. Third, to explore variables associated with HRQoL in a pandemic environment. Methods: This cross-sectional study includes survey data from 2,205 Norwegian adolescents 16-19 years of age. The participants reported on their health information sources, HL, handwashing knowledge and behavior, number of social interactions, and HRQoL. Associations between study variables and specified outcomes were explored using multiple linear and logistic regression analyses. Results: Television (TV) and family were indicated to be the main sources for pandemic-related health information. Handwashing, physical distancing, and limiting the number of social contacts were the most frequently reported measures. HL and handwashing knowledge and HL and handwashing behavior were significantly associated. For each unit increase on the HL scale, the participants were 5% more likely to socialize less with friends in comparison to normal. The mean HRQoL was very poor compared to European norms. Being quarantined or isolated and having confirmed or suspected Covid-19 were significantly negatively associated with HRQoL, but seeing less friends than normal was not associated. HL was significantly positively associated with HRQoL, albeit of minor clinical importance. Conclusion: Adolescents follow the health authorities' guidelines and appear highly literate. However, high fidelity requires great sacrifice because the required measures seem to collide with certain aspects that are important for the adolescents' HRQoL.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly identified pathogen causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an antimalarial and anti-inflammatory drug, has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and tested in clinical studies. However, lung concentration (6.7 {micro}g/mL) to predict the in vivo antiviral efficacy might not be achievable with the currently proposed oral dosing regimen. Further, a high cumulative doses of HCQ may raise concerns of systemic toxicity, including cardiotoxicity. Here, we described a non-clinical study to investigate the pharmacokinetics of a novel formulation of liposomal HCQ administrated by intratracheal (IT) instillation in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats which achieved 129.4 {micro}g/g (Cmax) in the lung. Compared to unformulated HCQ administered intravenous (IV), liposomal HCQ with normalized dose showed higher ([~]30-fold) lung exposure, longer ([~]2.5-fold) half-life in lung, but lower blood exposure with [~]20% of Cmax and 74% of AUC and lower heart exposure with 24% of Cmax and 58% of AUC. In conclusion, the pharmacokinetics results in an animal model demonstrate the proof of concept that inhalable liposomal HCQ may provide clinical benefit and serve as a potential treatment for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Background: Mortality in care homes has had a prominent focus during the COVID-19 outbreak. Multiple and interconnected challenges face the care home sector in the prevention and management of outbreaks of COVID-19, including adequate supply of personal protective equipment, staff shortages, and insufficient or lack of timely COVID-19 testing. Care homes are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases. Aim: To analyse the mortality of older care home residents in Wales during COVID-19 lockdown and compare this across the population of Wales and the previous 4-years. Study Design and Setting: We used anonymised Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and administrative data from the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank to create a cross-sectional cohort study. We anonymously linked data for Welsh residents to mortality data up to the 14th June 2020. Methods: We calculated survival curves and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of mortality. We adjusted hazard ratios for age, gender, social economic status and prior health conditions. Results: Survival curves show an increased proportion of deaths between 23rd March and 14th June 2020 in care homes for older people, with an adjusted HR of 1.72 (1.55, 1.90) compared to 2016. Compared to the general population in 2016-2019, adjusted care home mortality HRs for older adults rose from 2.15 (2.11,2.20) in 2016-2019 to 2.94 (2.81,3.08) in 2020. Conclusions: The survival curves and increased HRs show a significantly increased risk of death in the 2020 study periods.",

    "abstract": "Strategies to develop therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infection may be informed by experimental identification of viral-host protein interactions in cellular assays and measurement of host response proteins in COVID-19 patients. Identification of genetic variants that influence the level or activity of these proteins in the host could enable rapid  in silico assessment in human genetic studies of their causal relevance as molecular targets for new or repurposed drugs to treat COVID-19. We integrated large-scale genomic and aptamer-based plasma proteomic data from 10,708 individuals to characterize the genetic architecture of 179 host proteins reported to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins or to participate in the host response to COVID-19. We identified 220 host DNA sequence variants acting in cis (MAF 0.01-49.9%) and explaining 0.3-70.9% of the variance of 97 of these proteins, including 45 with no previously known protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) and 38 encoding current drug targets. Systematic characterization of pQTLs across the phenome identified protein-drug-disease links, evidence that putative viral interaction partners such as MARK3 affect immune response, and establish the first link between a recently reported variant for respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients at the ABO locus and hypercoagulation, i.e. maladaptive host response. Our results accelerate the evaluation and prioritization of new drug development programmes and repurposing of trials to prevent, treat or reduce adverse outcomes. Rapid sharing and dynamic and detailed interrogation of results is facilitated through an interactive webserver (https://omicscience.org/apps/covidpgwas/).",

    "abstract": "The lockdown policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK has a potentially important impact on provision of mental healthcare with uncertain consequences over the 12 months ahead. Past activity may provide a means to predict future demand. Taking advantage of the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource at the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in south London), we carried out a range of descriptive analyses to inform the Trust on patient groups who might be most likely to require inpatient and home treatment team (HTT) crisis care. We considered the 12 months following UK COVID-19 lockdown policy on 16th March, drawing on comparable findings from previous years, and quantified levels of change in service delivery to those most likely to receive crisis care. For 12-month crisis days from 16th March in 2015-19, we found that most (over 80%) were accounted for by inpatient care (rather than HTT), most (around 75%) were used by patients who were current or recent Trust patients at the commencement of follow-up, and highest numbers were used by patients with a previously recorded schizophreniform disorder diagnosis. For current/recent patients on 16th March there had been substantial reductions in use of inpatient care in the following 31 days in 2020, more than previous years; changes in total non-inpatient contact numbers did not differ in 2020 compared to previous years, although there had been a marked switch from face-to-face to virtual contacts.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionNovel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has propagated a global pandemic with significant health, economic and social costs. Emerging emergence has suggested that several factors may be associated with increased risk from severe outcomes or death from COVID-19. Clinical risk prediction tools have significant potential to generate individualised assessment of risk and may be useful for population stratification and other use cases.\n\nMethods and analysisWe will use a prospective open cohort study of routinely collected data from 1205 general practices in England in the QResearch database. The primary outcome is COVID-19 mortality (in or out-of-hospital) defined as confirmed or suspected COVID-19 mentioned on the death certificate, or death occurring in a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection between 24th January and 30th April 2020. Our primary outcome in adults is COVID-19 mortality (including out of hospital and in hospital deaths). We will also examine COVID-19 hospitalisation in children. Time-to-event models will be developed in the training data to derive separate risk equations in adults (19-100 years) for males and females for evaluation of risk of each outcome within the 3-month follow-up period (24th January to 30th April 2020), accounting for competing risks. Predictors considered will include age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, smoking status, alcohol intake, body mass index, pre-existing medical co-morbidities, and concurrent medication. Measures of performance (prediction errors, calibration and discrimination) will be determined in the test data for men and women separately and by ten-year age group. For children, descriptive statistics will be undertaken if there are currently too few serious events to allow development of a risk model. The final model will be externally evaluated in (a) geographically separate practices and (b) other relevant datasets as they become available.\n\nEthics and disseminationThe project has ethical approval and the results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nStrengths and limitations of the studyO_LIThe individual-level linkage of general practice, Public Health England testing, Hospital Episode Statistics and Office of National Statistics death register datasets enable a robust and accurate ascertainment of outcomes\nC_LIO_LIThe models will be trained and evaluated in population-representative datasets of millions of individuals\nC_LIO_LIShielding for clinically extremely vulnerable was advised and in place during the study period, therefore risk predictions influenced by the presence of some  shielding conditions may require careful consideration\nC_LI",

Mental health disorders are suggested to have a well-correlated link to suicide, which is the third most leading cause of death worldwide amongst children aged 15-19 years. According to WHO, \"health is a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease.\" Hence the isolation brought about by SARS-CoV-2 is postulated to cause anxiety, fear, and depression amongst the pediatric population, due to the loss of socialization and separation from friends. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we highlight the major mental health issues in children aged 2-18 years, along with their causes, effects, and potential solutions to tackle these problems.",

The aim of this study was to examine the readability of international and national health organizations on Covid-19 information in their websites employing a previously validated tool.\n\nMethodsA purposive sample of publicly accessible governmental and popular international health organization websites was selected. The readability of the websites Covid-19 public health information was estimated using the previously validated SMOG readability formula, which determined reading level by correlating the number of polysyllabic words.\n\nResultsOf the 10 websites included in the analysis, none had Covid-19 public health information at the USDHHSs recommended reading level. The material ranged in reading level at undergraduate level or above.\n\nDiscussionThe findings indicate that the online Covid-19 materials need to be modified in order to reach recommended reading levels. This study can be of practical use to policy makers and public health government officials when designing, modifying, and evaluating Covid-19 materials. We recommend using simple, non-polysyllable words to ensure that Covid-19 public health information materials are written at the recommended reading levels.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between meteorological factors such as temperature and humidity with COVID-19 incidence is still unclear after 6 months of the beginning of the pandemic. Some literature confirms the association of temperature with disease transmission while some oppose the same. This work intends to determine whether there is a causal association between temperature, humidity and Covid-19 cases. Three different causal models were used to capture stochastic, chaotic and symbolic natured time-series data and to provide a robust & unbiased analysis by constructing networks of causal relationships between the variables. Granger-Causality method, Transfer Entropy method & Convergent Cross-Mapping (CCM) was done on data from regions with different temperatures and cases greater than 50,000 as of 13th May 2020. From the Granger-Causality test we found that in only Canada, the United Kingdom, temperature and daily new infections are causally linked. The same results were obtained from Convergent Cross Mapping for India. Again using Granger-Causality test, we found that in Russia only, relative humidity is causally linked to daily new cases. Thus, a Generalized Additive Model with a smoothing spline function was fitted for these countries to understand the directionality. Using the combined results of the said models, we were able to conclude that there is no evidence of a causal association between temperature, humidity and Covid-19 cases.",

We provide an extensive evaluation of this fully automated assay on the Cobas e801/e602 immunoassay analysers.\n\nMethodsWe assessed the linearity, precision, and throughput of the Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay. Sensitivity was calculated from 349 SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive samples; specificity was determined from 714 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-naive samples. We examined cross-reactivity against other antibody positive samples (syphilis, RF, ANA, ds-DNA, influenza, dengue, HBV, HCV) and the anti-SARS-CoV-2 kinetics.\n\nResultsThe assay cut-off index (COI) was linear up to 90.7. The inter-assay precision was 2.9% for a negative control (COI=0.1) and 5.1% for a positive control (COI=3.0). Assay time is 18min and results are available 1 minute later; throughput for 300 samples was 76 minutes. No cross-reactivity was observed with other antibody positive samples; specificity was 100%. The assay has a sensitivity of 97.1% 14 days after PCR positivity (POS) and 100% at [&ge;]21 days POS; 48.2% of cases had anti-SARS-CoV-2 within 6 days POS. In 11 subjects in whom serum was available prior to a positive antibody signal (COI [&ge;]1.0) the interval between the last negative and first positive COI (time to \"sero-conversion\") on average is 3 days (range 1-6 days) and 4 more days (range 1-7) for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 to plateau.\n\nConclusionThe Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay shows excellent performance with minimal cross-reactivity from other viral and confounding antibodies. Antibody development and sero-conversion appears quite early.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosis and surveillance of emerging pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 depend on nucleic acid isolation from clinical and environmental samples. Under normal circumstances, samples would be processed using commercial proprietary reagents in Biosafety 2 (BSL-2) or higher facilities. A pandemic at the scale of COVID-19 has caused a global shortage of proprietary reagents and BSL-2 laboratories to safely perform testing. Therefore, alternative solutions are urgently needed to address these challenges. We developed an open-source method called Magnetic-nanoparticle-Aided Viral RNA Isolation of Contagious Samples (MAVRICS) that is built upon reagents that are either readily available or can be synthesized in any molecular biology laboratory with basic equipment. Unlike conventional methods, MAVRICS works directly in samples inactivated in acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform (e.g., TRIzol), thus allowing infectious samples to be handled safely without biocontainment facilities. Using 36 COVID-19 patient samples, 2 wastewater samples and 1 human pathogens control sample, we showed that MAVRICS rivals commercial kits in validated diagnostic tests of SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus. MAVRICS is scalable and thus could become an enabling technology for widespread community testing and wastewater monitoring in the current and future pandemics.",

Only few cases showed positive results for IgM in the early stage of disease and the IgM antibody-positive rates over the entire period were low, suggesting that the kits used in this study were unsuitable for diagnosis of COVID-19. The IgG antibody was positive in almost all samples after 13 days of onset, suggesting that it may be useful for determining infections in the recent past.",

    "abstract": "AimThis study aimed to evaluate the association between obesity and composite poor outcome in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a systematic literature search from PubMed and Embase database. We included all original research articles in COVID-19 adult patients and obesity based on classification of Body Mass Index (BMI) and composite poor outcome which consist of mortality, morbidity, admission of Intensive Care Unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), and severe COVID-19.\n\nResultsNine studies were included in meta-analysis with 6 studies presented BMI as continuous outcome and 3 studies presented BMI as dichotomous outcome (obese and non-obese). Most studies were conducted in China (55.5%) with remaining studies from French, Germany, and United States (US). COVID-19 patients with composite poor outcome had higher BMI with mean difference 0.55 kg/m2 (95% CI 0.07-1.03, P=0.02). BMI [&ge;]30 (obese) was associated with composite poor outcome with odds ratio 1.89 (95% CI 1.06-3.34, P=0.03). Multivariate meta-regression analysis by including three moderators: age, hypertension, and Diabetes Mellitus type 2 (DM type 2) showed the association between obesity and composite poor outcome was affected by age with regression coefficient =-0.06 and P=0.02. Subgroup analysis was not performed due to the limited number of studies for several outcomes.\n\nConclusionObesity is a risk factor of composite poor outcome of COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 patients with composite poor outcome have higher BMI. BMI is an important routine procedure that should be assessed in the management of COVID-19 patients and special attention should be given to patients with obesity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere are significant gaps in our understanding of the mortality effects of COVID-19 due to evolving diagnosis criteria, shortages of testing supplies, and challenges faced by physicians in treating patients in crisis environments. Accurate information on the number of deaths caused by COVID-19, both population wide and for demographic subgroups, is vital for policy makers and health care providers.\n\nMethodsWe performed a retrospective study of weekly data for Ohio, a large American state. To estimate expected mortality in 2020 we employed data from 2010 through 2019, adjusted for secular trends and seasonality. We estimated excess mortality as the number of observed deaths less the number of expected deaths. We conducted the analysis for the entire population and by gender, race, age, and county of residence.\n\nFindingsWe estimated 1,485 (95% CI 680-2,345) excess all-cause deaths in Ohio from March 15, 2020 through May 23, 2020. When limited to deaths due to natural causes, the estimated excess number of deaths increased to 2,504 (95% CI 1,633-3,221), reflecting the countervailing effect of a decrease in deaths due to external causes. While the largest number excess of deaths was observed in the 80+ age group, excess deaths comprised 45.3% (95% CI 21.8-60.9) of observed deaths in the groups corresponding to ages between 20 and 49 years old. Our estimate of 729 (95% CI 355-966) excess deaths for this group substantially exceeds the reported number of COVID-19 deaths of 51. We found elevated excess deaths for older individuals, blacks, and males.\n\nInterpretationOur methodology addressed some of the challenges of estimating the number of deaths caused by COVID-19. Our finding of high proportional levels of excess deaths among younger age groups suggests that increases in the infection rates for this cohort may have a greater mortality impact than expected.\n\nFundingNone.",

The evidences of adverse events associated with RBV-use has mainly been derived in the context of hepatitis C (HCV) treatment, however the possible use of RBV in CoVID-19 patients could be limited to 14 days.\n\nMethodsLongitudinal study including HIV/HCV coinfected patients. We evaluate the hemoglobin dynamics and reductions as well as evaluate the development rate of anemia during the first 2 weeks of therapy in HCV infected patients.\n\nResults189 patients were included in the study. The median hemoglobin levels were 14.6 g/dL (IQR: 13.2-15.6 g/dL) and 13.5 g/dL (IQR: 12.3-14.5 g/dL) at weeks 1 and 2 of therapy, respectively. A cumulative number of 27 (14.2%) patients developed anemia (23 grade 1 [12.1%] and 4 grade 2 [2.1%]). We identify a baseline hemoglobin levels of 14 g/dL as the better cut-off to identify those patients with a high chance to develop anemia. Of the 132 patients with baseline hemoglobin level >14 g/dL, 8 developed anemia (6.1%) compared with 19 of 57 (33.3%) with hemoglobin levels lower than 14 g/dL (p < 0.001).\n\nConclusionsOur study shows valuable information about the early hemoglobin kinetic timing in patients on RBV-therapy, that could be useful to tailor CoVID-19 treatment if RBV use is considered.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an international emergency that has been addressed in many countries by changes in and restrictions on behaviour. These are often collectively labelled social distancing and lockdown. On the 23rd June 2020, Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom announced substantial easings of restrictions. This paper examines some of the data he presented.\n\nMethodsGeneralised additive models, with negative binomial errors and cyclic term representing day-of-week effects, were fitted to data on the daily numbers of new confirmed cases of COVID-19. Exponential rates for the epidemic were estimated for different periods, and then used to calculate R, the reproduction number, for the disease in different periods.\n\nResultsAfter an initial stabilisation, the lockdown reduced R to around 0.81 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.82). This value increased to around 0.94 (95% CI 0.89, 0.996) for the fortnight from the 9th June 2020.\n\nConclusionsOfficial UK data, presented as the easing of the lockdown was announced, shows that R was already more than half way back to 1 at that point. That suggests there was little scope for the announced changes to be implemented without restarting the spread of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Italy was the first Western country to be seriously affected by COVID-19, and the first to implement drastic measures, which have successfully curtailed the epidemic. To understand which contain measures effected disease dynamics, we estimate change points in COVID-19 dynamics by fitting a compartmental model to official Italian data. Our results indicate that lockdowns managed to cause the epidemic to peak in late March 2020. Surprisingly, we found a change point during the decay from the peak, which does not correspond to obvious drastic legal interventions, but may be explained by widespread promotion and mandatory use of face masks. We confirm these interpretations at regional levels, and find that the gradual reopening of society since early May has caused no change in disease dynamics. We speculate that widespread use of face masks and other protective means has contributed substantially to keeping the number of new Italian COVID-19 cases under control in spite of society turning towards a new normality.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTSARS-CoV-2 is rapidly evolving with the continuous emergence of new mutations. There is no specific antiviral therapy for COVID-19, and the use of Remdesivir for treating COVID-19 will likely continue before clinical trials are completed. Due to the lengthening pandemic and evolving nature of the virus, predicting potential residues prone to mutations is crucial for the management of Remdesivir resistance. We used a rational ligand-based interface design complemented with mutational mapping to generate a total of 100,000 mutations and provide insight into the functional outcome of mutations in the Remdesivir-binding site in nsp12. After designing 56 residues in the Remdesivir binding site of nsp12, the designs retained 96-98% sequence identity, which suggests that SARS-CoV-2 attains resistance and develops further infectivity with very few mutations in the nsp12. We also identified affinity-attenuating Remdesivir binding designs of nsp12. Several mutants acquired decreased binding affinity with Remdesivir, which suggested drug resistance. These hotspot residues had a higher probability of undergoing selective mutations in the future to develop Remdesivir and related drug-based resistance. A comparison of 21 nsp12 Remdesivir-bound designs to the 13 EIDD-2801-bound nsp12 designs suggested that EIDD-2801 would be more effective in preventing the emergence of resistant mutations and against Remdesivir-resistance strains due to the restricted mutational landscape. Combined with the availability of more genomic data, our information on mutation repertoires is critical to guide scientists to rational structure-based drug discovery. Knowledge of the potential residues prone to mutation improves our understanding and management of drug resistance and disease pathogenesis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

Because most human antibodies against the RBD neutralized the virus by inhibiting host cell entry, we selected one of these clonotypes and demonstrated that it could potently inhibit viral replication.

    "abstract": "The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a major global health crisis. Currently, diagnosis is based on molecular techniques, which detect the viral nucleic acids when present at detectable levels. The serum IgG response against SARS-CoV-2 was examined by using an ELISA-based assay. Serum samples, along with nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from various cohorts and analyzed by ELISA and rRT-PCR, respectively. A total of 167 serum samples were tested for serum IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in outpatient cohorts, 15 (8.9%) were positive by rRT-PCR and the remaining 152 (91%) were negative. We used these data to generate two different assay cutoffs for serum IgG assay and investigated percent concordance with rRT-PCR test results. The emergency department data revealed, out of 151 nasopharyngeal swabs, 4 (2.6%) were positive by rRT-PCR and 18 (11.9%) were positive for serum IgG assay. Among the 18 patients that were positive for serum IgG, 13 (72.2%) exhibited 1-3 symptoms of COVID-19 and 5 (27.7%) patients did not present with any COVID-19 related symptoms, per CDC criteria. All 4 (100%) patients that were positive by rRT-PCR had symptoms of COVID-19 disease. A longitudinal study from the inpatient population suggested there was a sharp increase in the serum IgG titers in 5 patients, a moderate increase in 1 patient and a plateau in 3 patients. Sero-prevalence of COVID-19 disease in pre-procedure patients was 5.5%. Our findings suggest serological tests can be used for appropriate patient triaging when performed as an adjunct to existing molecular testing.",

    "abstract": "The nucleocapsid (N) protein of coronaviruses serves two major functions: compaction of the RNA genome in the virion and regulation of viral gene transcription in the infected cell1\u20133. The N protein contains two globular RNA-binding domains surrounded by regions of intrinsic disorder4. Phosphorylation of the central disordered region is required for normal viral genome transcription5,6, which occurs in a cytoplasmic structure called the replication transcription complex (RTC)7\u201311. It is not known how phosphorylation controls N protein function. Here we show that the N protein of SARS-CoV-2, together with viral RNA, forms biomolecular condensates12\u201315. Unmodified N protein forms partially ordered gel-like structures that depend on multivalent RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions. Phosphorylation reduces a subset of these interactions, generating a more liquid-like droplet. We speculate that distinct oligomeric states support the two functions of the N protein: unmodified protein forms a structured oligomer that is suited for nucleocapsid assembly, and phosphorylated protein forms a liquid-like compartment for viral genome processing. Inhibitors of N protein phosphorylation could therefore serve as antiviral therapy.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

In this study, we describe the pattern of bed occupancy across England during the first wave of the pandemic, January 31st to June 5th 2020.\n\nMethodsBed availability and occupancy data was extracted from daily reports submitted by all English secondary care providers, between 27-Mar and 5-June. Two thresholds for  safe occupancy were utilized (85% as per Royal College of Emergency Medicine and 92% as per NHS Improvement).\n\nFindingsAt peak availability, there were 2711 additional beds compatible with mechanical ventilation across England, reflecting a 53% increase in capacity, and occupancy never exceeded 62%. A consequence of the repurposing of beds meant that at the trough, there were 8{middle dot}7% (8,508) fewer general and acute (G&A) beds across England, but occupancy never exceeded 72%. The closest to (surge) capacity that any trust in England reached was 99{middle dot}8% for general and acute beds. For beds compatible with mechanical ventilation there were 326 trust-days (3{middle dot}7%) spent above 85% of surge capacity, and 154 trust-days (1{middle dot}8%) spent above 92%. 23 trusts spent a cumulative 81 days at 100% saturation of their surge ventilator bed capacity (median number of days per trust = 1 [range: 1 to 17]). However, only 3 STPs (aggregates of geographically co-located trusts) reached 100% saturation of their mechanical ventilation beds.\n\nInterpretationThroughout the first wave of the pandemic, an adequate supply of all bed-types existed at a national level. Due to an unequal distribution of bed utilization, many trusts spent a significant period operating above  safe-occupancy thresholds, despite substantial capacity in geographically co-located trusts; a key operational issue to address in preparing for a potential second wave.\n\nFundingThis study received no funding.\n\nResearch In ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence Before This StudyC_ST_ABSWe identified information sources describing COVID-19 related bed and mechanical ventilator demand modelling, as well as bed occupancy during the first wave of the pandemic by performing regular searches of MedRxiv, PubMed and Google, using the terms  COVID-19,  mechanical ventilators,  bed occupancy,  England,  UK,  demand, and  non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs), until June 20th, 2020. Two UK-specific studies were found that modelled the demand for mechanical ventilators, one of which incorporated sensitivity analysis based on the introduction of NPIs and found that their effects might prevent the healthcare system being overwhelmed. Separately, several news reports were found pertaining to a single hospital that reached ventilator capacity in England during the first wave of the pandemic, however, no single authoritative source was identified detailing impact across all hospital sites in England.\n\nAdded Value of This StudyThis national study of hospital-level bed occupancy in England provides unique and timely insight into bed-specific resource utilization during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, nationally, and by specific (geographically defined) health footprints. We found evidence of an unequal distribution of resource utilization across England. Although occupancy of beds compatible with mechanical ventilation never exceeded 62% at the national level, 52 (30%) hospitals across England reached 100% saturation at some point during the first wave of the pandemic. Close examination of the geospatial data revealed that in the vast majority of circumstances there was relief capacity in geographically co-located hospitals. Over the first wave it was theoretically possible to markedly reduce (by 95.1%) the number of hospitals at 100% saturation of their mechanical ventilator bed capacity by redistributing patients to nearby hospitals.\n\nImplications Of All The Available EvidenceNow-casting using routinely collected administrative data presents a robust approach to rapidly evaluate the effectiveness of national policies introduced to prevent a healthcare system being overwhelmed in the context of a pandemic illness. Early investment in operational field hospital and an independent sector network may yield more overtly positive results in the winter, when G&A occupancy-levels regularly exceed 92% in England, however, during the first wave of the pandemic they were under-utilized. Moreover, in the context of the non-pharmacological interventions utilized during the first wave of COVID-19, demand for beds and mechanical ventilators was much lower than initially predicted, but despite this many trust spent a significant period of time operating above  safe-occupancy thresholds. This finding demonstrates that it is vital that future demand (prediction) models reflect the nuances of local variation within a healthcare system. Failure to incorporate such geographical variation can misrepresent the likelihood of surpassing availability thresholds by averaging out over regions with relatively lower demand, and presents a key operational issue for policymakers to address in preparing for a potential second wave.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAs countries begin to ease the lockdown measures instituted to control the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a risk of a resurgence of the pandemic. The UK started easing lockdown in England when levels of community transmission remained high, which could have a major impact on case numbers and deaths. Using a Bayesian model we assessed the potential impacts of successive lockdown easing measures in England, focussing on scenarios where the reproductive number (R) remains [&le;]1 in line with the UK governments stated aim.\n\nMethodsWe developed a Bayesian model to infer incident cases and R in England, from incident death data from the Office of National Statistics. We then used this to forecast excess cases and deaths in multiple plausible scenarios in which R increases at one or more time points, compared to a baseline scenario where R remains unchanged by the easing of lockdown.\n\nFindingsThe model inferred an R of 0.81 on the 13th May when England first started easing lockdown. In the most conservative scenario where R increases to 0.85 as lockdown was eased further on 1st June and then remained constant, the model predicts an excess 400 (95% CI 34-1988) deaths and 56,019 (95% CI 4768-278,083) cumulative cases over 90 days. In the scenario with maximal increases in R (but staying [&le;]1) with successive easing of lockdown, the model predicts 1,946 (95% CI 165-9,667) excess cumulative deaths and 351,460 (95% CI 29,894-1,747,026) excess cases.\n\nInterpretationWhen levels of transmission are high, even small changes in R with easing of lockdown can have significant impacts on expected cases and deaths, even if R remains [&le;]1. This will have a major impact on tracing systems and health care services in England. This model can be updated with incoming death data to refine predictions over time.\n\nFundingNone.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe impact of social distancing and lockdown measures on controlling the COVID-19 pandemic has been studied extensively over the last few months. However there has been little examination of the likely impact of easing lockdown measures in a staged manner as is being currently carried out in England, UK. We searched PubMed, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arXiv, and Wellcome Open Research for peer-reviewed articles, preprints, and research reports using the terms \"COVID-19\", \"United Kingdom\" and \"lockdown\" for research examining these impacts, but found no relevant research that could inform the impact of phased easing of lockdown within England, UK.\n\nAdded value of this studyDecisions around timing of easing lockdown need to be informed by current scientific evidence. In this context, this study provides urgently needed information about the potential impact of lockdown easing at this point within the COVID-19 pandemic in England. Using an epidemiological approach with Bayesian inference, we specifically assess several plausible scenarios of increase in R from baseline as a result of easing lockdown measures at levels of current community transmission, even when the R is maintained [&le;]1, which is the stated aim of the UK government. We provide a comparison of these scenarios, with a baseline scenario where R remains constant, as well as against elimination strategies, where transmission is aggressively suppressed to the lowest level possible. As our code is publicly available, these methods can be easily applied to accruing data, and to any number of scenarios to better understand the implications for public health policy.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceEasing lockdown at a point of relatively high community transmission within the UK would lead to substantial excesses of deaths, and cases, even if R is maintained at [&le;]1. As expected, these increases are more marked, when R rises above 1, which is a distinct possibility, given recent estimates of R by a UK government advisory group.1 Our findings suggest that an elimination strategy would be more appropriate at this point, to allow suppression of community transmission to a point where easing of lockdown would not have the same impact, as with current transmission, and would likely not overwhelm systems of test, trace and isolate, and health services within England.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundObesity is a modifiable risk factor for coronavirus(COVID-19)-related mortality. We estimated excess mortality in obesity, both \"direct\", through infection, and \"indirect\", through changes in healthcare, and also due to potential increasing obesity during lockdown.\n\nMethodsIn population-based electronic health records for 1 958 638 individuals in England, we estimated 1-year mortality risk(\"direct\" and \"indirect\" effects) for obese individuals, incorporating: (i)pre-COVID-19 risk by age, sex and comorbidities, (ii)population infection rate, and (iii)relative impact on mortality(relative risk, RR: 1.2, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0). Using causal inference models, we estimated impact of change in body-mass index(BMI) and physical activity during 3-month lockdown on 1-year incidence for high-risk conditions(cardiovascular diseases, CVD; diabetes; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD and chronic kidney disease, CKD), accounting for confounders.\n\nFindingsFor severely obese individuals (3.5% at baseline), at 10% population infection rate, we estimated direct impact of 240 and 479 excess deaths in England at RR 1.5 and 2.0 respectively, and indirect effect of 383 to 767 excess deaths, assuming 40% and 80% will be affected at RR=1.2. Due to BMI change during the lockdown, we estimated that 97 755 (5.4%: normal weight to overweight, 5.0%: overweight to obese and 1.3%: obese to severely obese) to 434 104 individuals (15%: normal weight to overweight, 15%: overweight to obese and 6%: obese to severely obese) individuals would be at higher risk for COVID-19 over one year.\n\nInterpretationPrevention of obesity and physical activity are at least as important as physical isolation of severely obese individuals during the pandemic.\n\nO_TEXTBOXResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arXiv, and Wellcome Open Research for peer-reviewed articles, preprints, and research reports on obesity, excess mortality and change in body-mass index in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), using the search terms \"obesity\", \"coronavirus\", \"COVID-19\", and similar terms, and \"mortality\", up to June 15, 2020. We found no prior studies of excess deaths in obese individuals due to COVID-19 pandemic, and no studies of long-term estimates or the relative impact of COVID-19 on mortality. Moreover, there were no studies of change in body-mass index during lockdown periods. Without these data, it is difficult to make specific recommendations in obese people at individual or population level during the pandemic.\n\nAdded value of this studyWe estimated excess COVID-19-related mortality in severely obese individuals, targeted in physical distancing and isolation policies in UK government guidance. Assuming 10% infection rate, we estimated a direct impact of 240 to 479 excess deaths in England and indirect effect of 383 to 767 excess deaths. On the other hand, we estimated that between 97 755 and 434 104 individuals may develop high-risk conditions for COVID-19 mortality during a 3-month lockdown due to change in body-mass index and physical activity.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceThese analyses support COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 impact assessment in policy planning during the pandemic. The implications of distancing and isolation measures on incidence and mortality from chronic diseases, particularly relating to obesity, needs to be considered in clinical practice, public health and research.\n\nC_TEXTBOX",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEarly descriptions of the coronavirus outbreak showed a lower prevalence of asthma and COPD than was expected for people diagnosed with COVID-19, leading to speculation that inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) may protect against infection with SARS-CoV-2, and development of serious sequelae. We evaluated the association between ICS and COVID-19 related death using linked electronic health records in the UK.\n\nMethodsWe conducted cohort studies on two groups of people (COPD and asthma) using the OpenSAFELY platform to analyse data from primary care practices linked to national death registrations. People receiving an ICS were compared to those receiving alternative respiratory medications. Our primary outcome was COVID-19 related death.\n\nFindingsWe identified 148,588 people with COPD and 817,973 people with asthma receiving relevant respiratory medications in the four months prior to 01 March 2020. People with COPD receiving ICS were at a greater risk of COVID-19 related death compared to those receiving a long-acting beta agonist (LABA) and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) (adjusted HR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.08 - 1.75). People with asthma receiving high dose ICS were at an increased risk of death compared to those receiving a short-acting beta agonist (SABA) only (adjusted HR = 1.52, 95%CI = 1.08 - 2.14); the adjusted HR for those receiving low-medium dose ICS was 1.10 (95% CI = 0.82 - 1.49). Quantitative bias analyses indicated that an unmeasured confounder of only moderate strength of association with exposure and outcome could explain the observed associations in both populations.\n\nInterpretationThese results do not support a major role of ICS in protecting against COVID-19 related deaths. Observed increased risks of COVID-19 related death among people with COPD and asthma receiving ICS can be plausibly explained by unmeasured confounding due to disease severity.\n\nFundingThis work was supported by the Medical Research Council MR/V015737/1.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 virus, the pathogen that causes Covid-19 disease, emerged in Wuhan region in China in 2019, infected more than 4M people and is responsible for death of at least 300K patients globally as of May 2020. Identification of the cellular response mechanisms to viral infection by SARS-CoV-2 may shed light on progress of the disease, indicate potential drug targets, and make design of new test methods possible.\n\nIn this study, we analysed transcriptomic response of normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) to SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared the response to H1N1 infection. Comparison of transcriptome of NHBE cells 24 hours after mock-infection and SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrated that most genes that respond to infection were upregulated (320 genes) rather than being downregulated (115 genes).While upregulated genes were enriched in signalling pathways related to virus response, downregulated genes are related to kidney development. We mapped the upregulated genes on KEGG pathways to identify the mechanisms that mediate the response. We identified canonical NF{kappa}B, TNF and IL-17 pathways to be significantly upregulated and to converge to NF{kappa}B pathway via positive feedback loops. Although virus entry protein ACE2 has low expression in NHBE cells, pathogen response pathways are strongly activated within 24 hours of infection. Our results also indicate that immune response system is activated at the early stage of the infection and orchestrated by a crosstalk of signalling pathways. Finally, we compared transcriptomic SARS-CoV-2 response to H1N1 response in NHBE cells to elucidate the virus specificity of the response and virus specific extracellular proteins expressed by NHBE cells.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the pandemic of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome resulting in infections and death of millions worldwide with maximum cases and mortality in USA. The current study focuses on understanding the population specific variations attributing its high rate of infections in specific geographical regions which may help in developing appropriate treatment strategies for COVID-19 pandemic. Rigorous phylogenetic network analysis of 245 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes inferred five central clades named a (ancestral), b, c, d and e (subtype e1 & e2) showing both divergent and linear evolution types. The clade d & e2 were found exclusively comprising of USA strains with highest known mutations. Clades were distinguished by ten co-mutational combinations in proteins; Nsp3, ORF8, Nsp13, S, Nsp12, Nsp2 and Nsp6 generated by Amino Acid Variations (AAV). Our analysis revealed that only 67.46 % of SNP mutations were carried by amino acid at phenotypic level. T1103P mutation in Nsp3 was predicted to increase the protein stability in 238 strains except six strains which were marked as ancestral type; whereas com (P5731L & Y5768C) in Nsp13 were found in 64 genomes of USA highlighting its 100% co-occurrence. Docking study highlighted mutation (D7611G) caused reduction in binding of Spike proteins with ACE2, but it also showed better interaction with TMPRSS2 receptor which may contribute to its high transmissibility in USA strains. In addition, we found host proteins, MYO5A, MYO5B & MYO5C had maximum interaction with viral hub proteins (Nucleocapsid, Spike & Membrane). Thus, blocking the internalization pathway by inhibiting MYO-5 proteins which could be an effective target for COVID-19 treatment. The functional annotations of the Host-Pathogen Interaction (HPI) network were found to be highly associated with hypoxia and thrombotic conditions confirming the vulnerability and severity of infection in the patients. We also considered the presence of CpG islands in Nsp1 and N proteins which may confers the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to enter and trigger methyltransferase activity inside host cell.",

    "abstract": "AimTo identify Australian primary healthcare nurses immediate support needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBackgroundCOVID-19 has had widespread implications for primary healthcare nurses. Supporting these nurses capacity to deliver quality care ensures that ongoing health needs can be met.\n\nMethodsPrimary healthcare nurses were recruited to an online survey via social media and professional organisations in April 2020.\n\nResultsSix-hundred and thirty-seven responses were included in analysis. Participants provided 1213 statements about perceived supports required to provide quality clinical care. From these, seven key categories emerged, namely; personal protective equipment, communication, funding, industrial issues, self-care, workplace factors and valuing nurses.\n\nConclusionA number of key issues relating to personal health and safety, care quality, and job security need to be addressed to support primary healthcare nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Addressing these support issues can assist in retaining nurses and optimising the role of primary healthcare nurses during a pandemic.\n\nImplications for nursing managementResponding to the needs of primary healthcare nurses has the potential to facilitate their role in providing community based healthcare. This knowledge can guide the provision of support for primary healthcare nurses during the current pandemic, as well as informing planning for future health crises.",

    "abstract": "We previously reported that the ApoE e4e4 genotype was associated with COVID-19 test positivity (OR=2.31, 95% CI: 1.65 to 3.24, p=1.19x10-6) in the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort, during the epidemic peak in England, from March 16 to April 26, 2020. With more COVID-19 test results (March 16 to May 31, 2020) and mortality data (to April 26, 2020) linked to UKB, we re-evaluated the ApoE e4 allele association with COVID-19 test positivity, and with all-cause mortality following test-confirmed COVID-19. Logistic regression models compared ApoE e4e4 participants (or e3e4s) to e3e3s with adjustment for sex; age on April 26th or age at death; baseline UKB assessment center in England (accounting for geographical differences in viral exposures); genotyping array type; and the top five genetic principal components (accounting for possible population admixture). ApoE e4e4 genotype was associated with increased risks of test positivity (OR=2.24, 95% CI: 1.72 to 2.93, p=3.24x10-9) and of mortality with test-confirmed COVID-19 (OR=4.29, 95% CI: 2.38 to 7.72, p=1.22x10-6), compared to e3e3s. Independent replications are needed to confirm our findings and mechanistic work is needed to understand how ApoE e4e4 results in the marked increase in vulnerability, especially for COVID-19 mortality. These findings also demonstrate that risks for COVID-19 mortality are not simply related to advanced chronological age or the comorbidities commonly seen in aging.",

    "abstract": "Medical practitioners record the condition status of a patient through qualitative and quantitative observations. The measurement of vital signs and molecular parameters in the clinics gives a complementary description of abnormal phenotypes associated with the progression of a disease. The Clinical Measurement Ontology (CMO) is used to standardize annotations of these measurable traits. However, researchers have no way to describe how these quantitative traits relate to phenotype concepts in a machine-readable manner. Using the WHO clinical case report form standard for the COVID-19 pandemic, we modeled quantitative traits and developed OWL axioms to formally relate clinical measurement terms with anatomical, biomolecular entities and phenotypes annotated with the Uber-anatomy ontology (Uberon), Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) and the Phenotype and Trait Ontology (PATO) biomedical ontologies. The formal description of these relations allows interoperability between clinical and biological descriptions, and facilitates automated reasoning for analysis of patterns over quantitative and qualitative biomedical observations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPrevious studies have identified that adults with cardiovascular diseases were disproportionately associated with a significantly increased risk of a severe form of COVID-19 and all-cause mortality. We aimed to describe the diagnosed COVID-19 cases and to estimate the symptomatic and asymptomatic suspected cases among individuals with pre-existing myocardial infarction myocardial infarction and their relatives in lockdown period. Methods: We conducted a two-week cross-sectional telephone survey, from May 4 to May 15, 2020, including all households with at least one individual with pre-existing cardiovascular disease in the past two years. We defined a suspected COVID-19 case when living with at least one individual tested positive to COVID-19, or when an individual has been in contact with a suspected or confirmed case since the March 1rst, or when a relative from the same house has been hospitalized or deceased for COVID-19.\n\nResultsWe observed high rates of compliance with health measures during the lockdown period, regardless of age or risk factors. Among individuals with myocardial infarction history, two were COVID-19 confirmed, 13{middle dot}37% were suspected (94/703) of whom 70{middle dot}21% (66/94) asymptomatic.\n\nConclusionsIndividuals with myocardial infarction history presented different symptoms association with more respiratory signs. This population, which is older and associated with more comorbidities, is exposed to a high risk of complication in the event of contamination. Infection rates are relevant to adjusting the management of emergency departments in our region.",

As of June 19, 2020, there have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Iwate. Here, we analyzed the excess deaths as well as the number of patients and medical earnings due to the pandemic from prefectural hospitals located in one of the least-affected areas in Japan. From January to March 2020, the excess death rates per month were not significantly higher than the past-year average. Compared to January 2020, the numbers of both outpatients and inpatients in April 2020 showed a 5.2% and 6.1% decrease, respectively. Accordingly, the amount of medical earnings of both outpatients and inpatients in April 2020 showed a 3.0% and 6.3% decrease, respectively. Present analysis demonstrated that there were no excess deaths due to \"unidentified\" COVID-19 infections in Iwate; however, hospital budgetary management has been affected by the social restrictions. Regardless of COVID-19 infection spread, it may be difficult to maintain daily medical services if such low service activity continues in the existing hospitals. Additional longitudinal studies will be necessary to evaluate the effects of social restrictions on hospital management, but the true demand of regional medical services may emerge after this outbreak.",

To plan effectively, the government needs to answer this question: what will be the effect of Covid-19 cases in the country? To answer this question accurately and objectively, forecasting the spread of confirmed Covid-19 cases will be vital. To this regard, this paper provides real times forecasts of Covid-19 cases employing Holts linear trend model without seasonality. Provided that the data employed is accurate and the past pattern of the disease will continue in the future, this model is powerful to produce real time forecasts in the future with some degree of uncertainty. With the help of these forecasts, the government can make evidence based decisions by utilizing the scarce resource available at its disposal.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesTo determine the sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR testing of upper respiratory tract (URT) samples from hospitalised patients with COVID-19, compared to the gold standard of a clinical diagnosis.\n\nMethodsAll URT RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in NHS Lothian, Scotland, United Kingdom between the 7th of February and 19th April 2020 (inclusive) was reviewed, and hospitalised patients were identified. All URT RT-PCR tests were analysed for each patient to determine the sequence of negative and positive results. For those who were tested twice or more but never received a positive result, case records were reviewed, and a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 allocated based on clinical features, discharge diagnosis, and radiology and haematology results. For those who had negative URT RT-PCR tests but a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, respiratory samples were retested using a multiplex respiratory panel, a second SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay, and a human RNase P control.\n\nResultsCompared to the gold standard of a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, the sensitivity of an initial URT RT-PCR for COVID-19 was 82.2% (95% confidence interval 79.0-85.1%). Two consecutive URT RT-PCR tests increased sensitivity to 90.6% (CI 88.0-92.7%). A further 2.2% and 0.9% of patients who received a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 were positive on a third and fourth test.\n\nConclusionsThe sensitivity of a single RT-PCR test of an URT sample in hospitalised patients is 82.2%. Sensitivity increases to 90.6% when patients are tested twice. A proportion of cases with clinically defined COVID-19 never test positive on URT RT-PCR despite repeated testing.",

    "abstract": "AbstactO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSType 2 diabetes (T2DM) and obesity are significant risks for mortality in Covid19. Metformin has been hypothesized as a treatment for COVID19. Metformin has sex specific immunomodulatory effects which may elucidate treatment mechanisms in COVID-19. In this study we sought to identify whether metformin reduced mortality from Covid19 and if sex specific interactions exist.\n\nMethodsDe-identified claims data from UnitedHealth were used to identify persons with at least 6 months continuous coverage who were hospitalized with Covid-19. Persons in the metformin group had at least 90 days of metformin claims in the 12 months before hospitalization. Unadjusted and multivariate models were conducted to assess risk of mortality based on metformin as a home medication in individuals with T2DM and obesity, controlling for pre-morbid conditions, medications, demographics, and state. Heterogeneity of effect was assessed by sex.\n\nResults6,256 persons were included; 52.8% female; mean age 75 years. Metformin was associated with decreased mortality in women by logistic regression, OR 0.792 (0.640, 0.979); mixed effects OR 0.780 (0.631, 0.965); Cox proportional-hazards: HR 0.785 (0.650, 0.951); and propensity matching, OR of 0.759 (0.601, 0.960). TNF inhibitors were associated with decreased mortality in the 38 persons taking them, by propensity matching, OR 0.19 (0.0378, 0.983).\n\nConclusionsMetformin was significantly associated with reduced mortality in women with obesity or T2DM in observational analyses of claims data from individuals hospitalized with Covid-19. This sex-specific finding is consistent with metformins reduction of TNF in females over males, and suggests that metformin conveys protection in Covid-19 through TNF effects.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), threatened to overwhelm Japans intensive care capacity due to the rising numbers of infected patients. This study aimed to determine the number of critically ill patients with COVID-19 who required intensive care, including mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), during the pandemic and to compare these patient numbers with Japans overall intensive care capacity.\n\nMethodsJapanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine datasets were used to obtain the number of confirmed patients with COVID-19 who had undergone mechanical ventilation and ECMO between February 15 and June 4 2020, to determine and compare intensive care unit (ICU) and attending bed needs for patients with COVID-19, and to estimate peak ICU demands in Japan.\n\nResultsIn total, 17968 ICU days, 15171 mechanical ventilation days, and 2797 ECMO days were attributable to patients with COVID-19. There was a median (interquartile range) 143 (63-255) patients in ICU, 124 (51-225) patients on mechanical ventilation, and 18 (15-36) patients on ECMO machines. During the epidemic peak in late April, 11443 patients (1.03 per 10000 adults) had been infected, 373 patients (0.034 per 10000 adults) were in ICU, 312 patients (0.028 per 10000 adults) were receiving mechanical ventilation, and 62 patients (0.0056 per 10000 adults) were on ECMO machines per day. The number of infected patients at the peak of the epidemic was 651% of total designated beds and the number of patients requiring intensive care at the peak of the epidemic was 6.0% of total ICU beds in Japan, 19.1% of total board-certified intensivists in Japan and 106% of total designated medical institutions for Category II infectious diseases in Japan, respectively.\n\nConclusionsFollowing the state of emergency declaration on April 7 2020, the number of patients with COVID-19 and the number of critically ill patients continued to rise, exceeding the number of designated beds but not exceeding ICU capacity. Urgent nationwide and regional planning is needed to prevent an overwhelming burden on ICUs in relation to critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Japan.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChloroquine (CQ) and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have recently been suggested as treatment for the current Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, despite their long-term use and only few case reports on adverse effects, CQ and HCQ are listed as a known risk of the lethal ventricular arrhythmia Torsade de Pointes and their cardiac safety profile is being questioned. Thus, we aimed to investigate the electrocardiographic and mortality effects of CQ and HCQ in a primary care population.\n\nMethodsWe used Danish health care registers and electrocardiograms (ECGs) from primary care to define three studies. 1) A paired study of subjects with ECGs before and during use of CQ/HCQ, 2) a matched ECG study of subjects taking CQ/HCQ compared to controls, and 3) a mortality study on people taking HCQ matched to control. In both matched studies, we adjusted for connective tissue diseases, use of QT-prolonging drugs, and cardiac disease. We used the QTc interval as the marker for electrocardiographic safety. In the mortality study, cases were followed from first claimed prescription until 300 days after estimated completion of the last prescription. 95% confidence intervals follow estimates in parenthesis.\n\nResultsUse of CQ was associated with a 5.5 (0.7;10) ms increase in QTc in the paired study (n=10). In the matched study (n=28, controls=280), QTc was insignificantly increased in subjects taking CQ by 4.7 (-3.4;13) ms. With a {Delta}QTc of 1.0 (-5.6;7.5), use of HCQ was not associated with an increased QTc in the paired study (n=32). In the matched study (n=172, controls=1,720), QTc also was not different between groups (p=0.5). In the mortality study (n=3,368), use of HCQ was associated with a hazard ratio of 0.67 (0.43;1.05).\n\nConclusionsIn subjects free of COVID-19, we found a small increase in QTc associated with use of chloroquine, but not hydroxychloroquine. We found no increased mortality associated with use of hydroxychloroquine.",

    "abstract": "We report the development of a Weibull based Long-Short-Term-Memory approach (W-LSTM) for the prediction of COVID-19 disease. The W-LSTM model developed in this study, performs better in terms of MSE, R2 and MAPE, as compared to the previously published models, including ARIMA, LSTM and their variations. Using W-LSTM model, we have predicted the beginning and end of the current cycle of COVID-19 in several countries. Performance of the model was validated as satisfactory in 82% of the 50 test countries, while asking for prediction for 10 days beyond the period of training. Accuracy of the above prediction with days beyond training was assessed in comparison with the MAPE that the model gave with cumulative global data. The model was applied to study correlation between the growth of infection and deaths, and a number of effectors that may influence the epidemic. The model identified age groups, trade with China, air traffic, country temperature and CoV-2 virus types as the likely effectors of infection and virulence leading to deaths. The predictors likely to promote or suppress the epidemic were identified. Some of the predictors had significant effect on the shape parameters of Weibull distribution. The model can function on cloud, take inputs in real time and handle large data country wise, at low costs to make predictions dynamically. Such predictions are highly valuable in guiding policy makers, administration and health. Interactive curves generated from the W-LSTM model can be seen at http://collaboration.coraltele.com/covid2/.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo estimate the incubation period and the serial interval of Covid-19 from a sample of symptomatic patients in Bahia Blanca city.\n\nMethodsWe collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) for the first 18 secondary patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Bahia Blanca (Argentina). We ranked the fiability of the data depending upon certainty about the identification of the infector and the date of exposition to infector.\n\nThe sample has some missing values. In the case of incubation, as 3 patients were infected by other household members, we only have 15 observations with an observed date of exposition. For the estimation of serial interval, one patient became ill from close contact with an asymptomatic infectious. Also, estimations of both the incubation period and the serial interval were carried using the full sample and a subsample with higher certainty about the transmissor and date of exposition. By the time the dataset was prepared all infectors were recovered so estimations do need to take into account right censoring.\n\nResultsThe mean incubation period for symptomatic patients is 7.9 days (95% CI: 4.6, 11.1) considering the sample of 15 cases patients and 7.5 days (95% CI: 4.1, 10.9) if the sample is restricted to the most certain cases (n=12). The median is 6.1 (95% CI: 4.1, 9.2) and 5.8 (95% CI: 3.6, 9.3) respectively. Moreover, 97.5% of symptomatic cases will develop symptoms afert 13.6 days from exposition (95% CI 10.7, 16.5).\n\nThe point estimation for the mean serial interval is 6.8 days (95% CI: 4.0-9.6). Considering only the most certain pairs, the mean serial interval is estimated at 5.5 days (95% CI: 2.8, 8.1). The estimated median serial intervals were 5.2 (95% CI: 3.0, 8.1) and 4.1 (95% CI: 2.0, 6.9) days respectively.\n\nConclusionsEvidence from Bahia Blanca (Argentina) suggests that the median and mean serial interval of Covid-19 is shorter than the incubation period. This suggests that a pre-symptomatic transmission is not negligible. Comparisons with foreign estimates show that incubation period and serial interval could be longer in Bahia Blanca city than in other regions. That poses a signal of opportunity to attain more timely contact tracing and effective isolation.\n\nHighlightsWe estimate the incubation period in a sample of 15 symptomatic patients with Covid-19 in Bahia Blanca city (Argentina).\n\nWe estimate the serial interval for Covid-19 infections in a sample of 17 infector-infectee pairs detected in Bahia Blanca city (Argentina).\n\nThe median serial interval is lower to the median incubation period, suggesting a transmission is taking place also during the pre-symptomatic phase.\n\nThe incubation period and serial interval of Covid-19 in Bahia Blanca city seem to take more days than in Asian regions. This finding slows down the pace of health assistance to patients (conditional to public interventions).\n\nLonger serial intervals help in tracing contacts and show relative slow turnover of case generations. At the same time, if symptoms take longer time to emerge, long serial intervals may also increase the reproductive number if contact tracing and effective isolation measures are placed untimely.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThe effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on mental health remain unclear. To mitigate the risks and capitalise on opportunities for positive change, we must understand how the impact has been mediated by sociodemographics, mental disorders, personality traits, life circumstances and the coping measures people choose to take.\n\nMETHODSData were collected from 376,987 members of the general public, predominantly in the UK, between late December 2019 and May 2020. Interaction models examined differences in sociodemographic distributions of mood and anxiety for 233,268 people in January vs. 109,749 in May. Factor analysis of a comprehensive instrument determined the dimensionality of self-perceived pandemic-driven change in wellbeing, outlook and behaviour for 74,830 participants in May. Linear modelling identified demographic, contextual, clinical, and trait predictors of pandemic impact. Topic modelling distilled prevalent advice from free-text responses.\n\nRESULTSAnxiety, depression and insomnia changed markedly in demographically-mediated ways. Untoward changes were larger for older adults. Benefits were greater for younger adults. Social connectedness was negatively affected across most mental and neurological conditions. There were disorder-specific changes in other domains, e.g., heightened conflict at home for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and heightened anxiety for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Psychiatric symptoms, personality traits, occupational variables and living conditions were amongst the strongest predictors of pandemic impact. Frontline health workers, carers of vulnerable older adults, and disabled or sheltered adults were disproportionately affected. Fifty advice topics were identified from free-text, the prevalence of which covaried with subpopulation, context and traits.\n\nCONCLUSIONSThe general public report positive and negative consequences of the pandemic. Particular subsets of people have heightened risk of untoward effects whereas other groups appear resilient. To be valid and effective, studies seeking to quantify, predict or mitigate the impact of pandemics on mental health should apply holistic approaches, combining multiple psycho-socio-economic factors.",

    "abstract": "Background/IntroductionPsychological and physical well-being of health personnel has been significantly affected by COVID-19. Work overload and continuous exposure to positive COVID-19 cases have caused them fatigue, stress, anxiety, insomnia and other detriments. This research aims: 1) to analyze whether the use of cognitive reevaluation and emotional suppression strategies decreases and increases, respectively, stress levels of health personnel; 2) to quantify the impact of contact with patients with COVID-19 on stresss level of medical staff.\n\nMethodEmotion regulation strategies and stress level were evaluated in 155 Dominican physicians by means of psychological tests with adequate levels of reliability. In addition, a questionnaire created by the researchers quantified the impact that contact with those infected had on their stress levels.\n\nResultsContact with patients with COVID-19 predicts increased use of emotion suppression strategies, although is not associated with the use of cognitive reevaluation. These findings lead to an even greater increase in stress on health care providers.\n\nConclusionsContextual contingencies demand immediate responses and may not allow health personnel to use cognitive re-evaluation strategies, leaning more towards emotion suppression. However, findings regarding high levels of stress require the implementation of intervention programs focused on the promotion of more functional emotion regulation strategies. Such programs may reduce current stress and prevent post-traumatic symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Modifiable risk factors affect SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality raising the possibility that lifestyle modification could play a role. This has not been studied at a global level. We analysed publicly available data from countries reporting COVID-19 cases and deaths. Associations of modifiable risk factors with total cases and excess deaths were determined with and without adjustment for confounders. 4,670,832 cases and 311,384 deaths were reported by 181 countries by 18th May 2020. Wealthier countries had the greatest caseload. Obesity was the primary modifiable risk factor for infection and greater age, male sex, physical inactivity and low salt consumption were associated with excess deaths. Obesity was less influential on mortality than physical inactivity. Globally, obesity confers vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection and physical inactivity likely explains the greater mortality in the obese. High salt consumption may induce reductions in tissue ACE2 expression and subsequently reduce mortality rates.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere are limited data on knowledge and behaviors related to COVID-19, and on the adoption of preventive behaviors, in sub-Saharan countries.\n\nMethodsBetween April 25th and May 23rd, we contacted 793 individuals aged 18 and older, who previously participated in studies conducted in the Karonga Health and Demographic Surveillance Site in Karonga District, Malawi. During an interview by mobile phone, we ascertained respondents sources of information about COVID-19 and we evaluated their knowledge of the transmission and course of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. We also asked them to evaluate their own risk of infection and severe illness. Finally, we inquired about the preventive measures they had adopted in response to the pandemic. We describe patterns of knowledge and behaviors among survey respondents, by area of residence (rural vs. urban).\n\nResultsWe interviewed 630 respondents (79.5% response rate) which included 260 men and 370 women. Four hundred and eighty-nine respondents resided in rural areas (77.6%) and 141 resided in urban areas (22.4%). Only one respondent had never heard of COVID-19. Respondents reported on average 4 distinct sources of information about COVID-19. Misconceptions about the modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and about the course and severity of COVID-19, were common. For example, two thirds of respondents believed that everyone with COVID-19 would eventually become severely ill. Increased hand washing and avoiding crowds were the most reported strategies to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Use of face masks was more common among urban residents (22.5%) than among rural residents (5.0%).\n\nConclusionDespite widespread access to information about the COVID-19 pandemic, gaps in knowledge about COVID-19 persist in this population. The adoption of preventive strategies remains limited, possibly due to limited perceived risk of infection among a large fraction of the population.",

    "abstract": "The lockdown and social distancing policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK has a potentially important impact on provision of mental healthcare; however, there has been relatively little quantification of this. Taking advantage of the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource with 24-hourly updates of electronic mental health records data, this paper describes daily caseloads and contact numbers (face-to-face and virtual) for home treatment teams (HTTs) and working age adult community mental health teams (CMHTs) from 1st February to 15th May 2020 at the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM), a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in south London. In addition daily deaths are described for all current and previous SLaM service users over this period and the same dates in 2019. In summary, comparing periods before and after 16th March 2020 the CMHT sector showed relatively stable caseloads and total contact numbers, but a substantial shift from face-to-face to virtual contacts, while HTTs showed the same changeover but reductions in caseloads and total contacts (although potentially an activity rise again during May). Number of deaths for the two months between 16th March and 15th May were 2.4-fold higher in 2020 than 2019, with 958 excess deaths.",

Staff had specific concerns about many groups of service users, including people whose conditions are exacerbated by pandemic anxieties and social disruptions; people experiencing loneliness, domestic abuse and family conflict; those unable to understand and follow social distancing requirements; and those who cannot engage with remote care.\n\nConclusionThis overview of staff concerns and experiences in the early COVID-19 pandemic suggests directions for further research and service development: we suggest that how to combine infection control and a therapeutic environment in hospital, and how to achieve effective and targeted tele-health implementation in the community, should be priorities. The limitations of our convenience sample must be noted.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCardiovascular diseases(CVD) increase mortality risk from coronavirus infection(COVID-19), but there are concerns that the pandemic has affected supply and demand of acute cardiovascular care. We estimated excess mortality in specific CVDs, both \"direct\", through infection, and \"indirect\", through changes in healthcare.\n\nMethodsWe used population-based electronic health records from 3,862,012 individuals in England to estimate pre- and post-COVID-19 mortality risk(\"direct\" effect) for people with incident and prevalent CVD. We incorporated: (i)pre-COVID-19 risk by age, sex and comorbidities, (ii)estimated population COVID-19 prevalence, and (iii)estimated relative impact of COVID-19 on mortality(relative risk, RR: 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0). For \"indirect\" effects, we analysed weekly mortality and emergency department data for England/Wales and monthly hospital data from England(n=2), China(n=5) and Italy(n=1) for CVD referral, diagnosis and treatment until 1 May 2020.\n\nFindingsCVD service activity decreased by 60-100% compared with pre-pandemic levels in eight hospitals across China, Italy and England during the pandemic. In China, activity remained below pre-COVID-19 levels for 2-3 months even after easing lockdown, and is still reduced in Italy and England. Mortality data suggest indirect effects on CVD will be delayed rather than contemporaneous(peak RR 1.4). For total CVD(incident and prevalent), at 10% population COVID-19 rate, we estimated direct impact of 31,205 and 62,410 excess deaths in England at RR 1.5 and 2.0 respectively, and indirect effect of 49932 to 99865 excess deaths.\n\nInterpretationSupply and demand for CVD services have dramatically reduced across countries with potential for substantial, but avoidable, excess mortality during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFundingNIHR, HDR UK, Astra Zeneca",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCOVID-19, which emerged in December 2019, is the largest pandemic ever to occur. During the early phase, little was known about public awareness relating to Coronavirus disease. This study was designed to determine knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) among the Iranian public towards COVID-19.\n\nMethodsA cross-sectional online survey was carried out in Iran from 2 March to 8 April 2020 using a self-administered questionnaire on 1,480 people. COVID-19-related KAP questions were adapted from other internationally validated questionnaires specific to infectious diseases.\n\nResultsAll participants were aware of COVID-19. When asked unprompted, 80% of respondents could correctly cite fever, difficulty breathing and cough as signs/symptoms of COVID-19. Most of our sample population knew that by staying at home and staying isolated (95.3%, 95 % CI: 94.2-96.3) as well as constant hand washing and using disinfectants (92.5%, 95 % CI: 91.1-93.8) could prevent COVID-19. However, there was also widespread misconceptions such as the belief that COVID-19 can be transmitted by wild animals (58%, 95 % CI: 55.5-60.5) and by air (48.3%, 95 % CI: 45.7-50.8). Unprompted, self-reported actions taken to avoid COVID-19 infection included hand washing with soap and water (95.4%, 95 % CI: 94.3-96.4), avoiding crowded places (93%, 95 % CI: 91.7-94.3), cleaning hands with other disinfectants (80.9 %, 95 % CI: 78.9-82.9), and covering mouths and noses when coughing and sneezing (76.1 %, 95 % CI: 73.9-78.2). The internet and social media (94.5%, 95 % CI: 93.3-95.6) were the main Coronavirus information sources. However, the most trusted information sources on Coronavirus were health and medical professionals (79.3%, 95 % CI: 77.2-81.3). The majority of participants (77.0%, 95 % CI: 74.8-79.1) wanted more information about Coronavirus to be available.\n\nConclusionOur findings suggest that peoples knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 at the time of its outbreak was of a high level. Therefore, health systems should use multiple ways, such as mass media, phone applications, electronic, print, and tele-education to increase KAP related to COVID-19.",

The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and work exhaustion were somewhat higher among clinicians than non-clinicians. Among all workers, anxiety, depression, and high work exhaustion were independently associated with community or clinical exposure to COVID-19 [Prevalence Ratios and 95% confidence intervals 1.37(1.09- 1.73), 1.28(1.03 - 1.59), and 1.24(1.13 - 1.36) respectively]. Poor family supportive behaviors by supervisors were also associated with these outcomes [1.40 (1.21 - 1.62), 1.69 (1.48 - 1.92), 1.54 (1.44 - 1.64)]. Age below 40 and a greater number of family/home stressors were also associated with poorer outcomes. Among the subset of clinicians, caring for patients with COVID-19 and work in high-risk clinical settings were additional risk factors.\n\nConclusions and ImplicationsOur findings suggest that the pandemic has had negative effects on mental health and well-being among both clinical and non-clinical employees. Prevention of exposure to COVID-19 and increased supervisor support are modifiable risk factors that may protect mental health and well-being.",

    "abstract": "The manifestation of the COVID-19 varies from absence of symptoms to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. The epidemiological data indicate that infection and mortality rates are greater in European populations in comparison with eastern Asians. To test if epidemiological patterns may be partly determined by human genetic variation, we investigated, by exomic and databank analyses, the variability found in the TMPRSS2 gene in populations from different continents, since this gene is fundamental to virus access into human cells. The functional variants revealed low diversity. The analyses of the variation in the modifiers of gene expression indicate that the European populations may have much higher levels of pulmonary expression of the TMPRSS2 gene and would be more vulnerable to infection by SARS-CoV-2. By contrast, the pulmonary expression of the TMPRSS2 may be reduced in the populations from East Asia, which implies that they are less susceptible to the virus infection and, these genetic features might also favor their better outcomes. The presented data, if confirmed, indicates a potential genetic contribution of TMPRSS2 to individual susceptibility to viral infection, and might also influence COVID-19 outcome.",

    "abstract": "After the rapid spread with severe consequences in Europe and China, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is now manifesting itself in more vulnerable countries, including those in Latin America. In order to guide political decision-making via epidemiological criteria, it is crucial to assess the real impact of the epidemic. However, the use of large-scale population testing is unrealistic or not feasible in some countries. Based on a newly developed mathematical model, we estimated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Latin American countries. The results show that the virus spreads unevenly across countries. For example, Ecuador and Brazil are the most affected countries, with approximately 3% of the infected population. Currently, the number of new infections is increasing in all countries examined, with the exception of some Caribbean countries as Cuba. Moreover, in these countries, the peak of newly infected patients has not yet been reached.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlthough SARS-CoV-2 infection in Healthcare Workers (HCWs) is a public health concern, there is little description of their longitudinal antibody response in the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 and symptoms. We followed HCWs in an acute London hospital to measure seroconversion and RNA detection at the peak of the pandemic.\n\nMethodsWe enrolled 200 patient-facing HCWs between 26 March and 8 April 2020 and collected twice-weekly self-administered nose and throat swabs, symptom data and monthly blood samples. Swabs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, and serum for antibodies to spike protein by ELISA and flow cytometry.\n\nFindingsDuring the first month, 42/200 (21%) HCWs were PCR positive in at least one nose and throat swab. Only 8/42 HCW (19%) who were PCR positive during the study period had symptoms that met current case definition. Of 181 HCWs who provided enrollment and follow-up blood samples, 82/181 (45.3%) were seropositive. In 33 HCWs who had positive serology at baseline but were PCR negative, 32 remained PCR negative. One HCW had a PCR positive swab six days after enrollment, likely representing waning infection.\n\nConclusionThe high seropositivity and RNA detection in these front-line HCWs brings policies to protect staff and patients into acute focus. Our findings have implications for planning for the  second wave and for vaccination campaigns in similar settings. The evidence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection indicates that asymptomatic HCW surveillance is essential, while our study sets the foundations to answer pertinent questions around the duration of protective immune response and the risk of re-infection.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesTo provide a sub-national analysis of excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy.\n\nDesignPopulation-based on all-cause mortality official data, available as counts by age and sex.\n\nSettingThe 7,904 municipalities in Italy.\n\nParticipantsAll residents in Italy in the years 2016 to 2020.\n\nMain outcome measuresAll-cause mortality weekly rates for each municipality, based on the first four months of 2016 - 2019. Predicted all-cause weekly deaths and mortality rates at municipality level for 2020, based on the modelled spatio-temporal trends.\n\nResultsThere was strong evidence of excess mortality for Northern Italy; Lombardia showed higher mortality rates than expected from the end of February, with 23,946 (23,013 to 24,786) total excess deaths. North-West and North-East regions showed higher mortality from the beginning of March, with 6,942 (6,142 to 7,667) and 8,033 (7,061 to 9,044) total excess deaths respectively. After discounting for the number of COVID-19-confirmed deaths, Lombardia still registered 10,197 (9,264 to 11,037) excess deaths, while regions in the North-West and North-East had 2,572 (1,772 to 3,297) and 2,047 (1,075 to 3,058) extra deaths, respectively. We observed marked geographical differences at municipality level. The city of Bergamo (Lombardia) showed the largest percent excess 88.9% (81.9% to 95.2%) at the peak of the pandemic. An excess of 84.2% (73.8% to 93.4%) was also estimated at the same time for the city of Pesaro (Central Italy), in stark contrast with the rest of the region, which does not show evidence of excess deaths.\n\nConclusionsOur study gives a comprehensive picture of the evolution of all-cause mortality in Italy from 2016 to 2020 and describes the spatio-temporal differences in excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our model shows heterogeneous impact of COVID-19, and it can be used to help policy- makers target measures to limit the burden on the health-care system as well as reducing social and economic consequences. Our probabilistic methodology is useful for real-time mortality surveillance, continuously monitoring local temporal trends and flagging where and when mortality rates deviate from the expected range, which might suggest a second wave of the pandemic.",

    "abstract": "We examined the link between BMI and risk of a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 and risk of COVID-19-related death among UK Biobank participants. Among 4855 participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 in hospital, 839 were positive and of these 189 died from COVID-19. Poisson models with penalised thin plate splines were run relating exposures of interest to test positivity and case-fatality, adjusting for confounding factors. BMI was associated strongly with positive test, and risk of death related to COVID-19. The gradient of risk in relation to BMI was steeper in those under 70, compared with those aged 70 years or older for COVID-19 related death (Pinteraction=0.03). BMI was more strongly related to test positivity (Pinteraction=0.010) and death (Pinteraction=0.002) in non-whites, compared with whites. These data add support for adiposity being more strongly linked to COVID-19-related deaths in younger people and non-white ethnicities. If future studies confirm causality, lifestyle interventions to improve adiposity status may be important to reduce the risk of COVID-19 in all, but perhaps particularly, non-white communities.",

    "abstract": "Current models for flu-like epidemics insufficiently explain multi-cycle seasonality. Meteorological factors alone, including associated behavior, do not predict seasonality, given substantial climate differences between countries that are subject to flu-like epidemics or COVID-19. Pollen is documented to be allergenic, plays a role in immuno-activation, and seems to create a bio-aerosol lowering the reproduction number of flu-like viruses. Therefore, we hypothesize that pollen may explain the seasonality of flu-like epidemics including COVID-19 in conjunction with meteorological variables.\n\nWe tested Pollen-Flu Seasonality Theory for 2016-2020 flu-like seasons, including COVID-19, in The Netherlands with its 17 million inhabitants. We combined changes in flu-like incidence per 100K/Dutch citizens (code: ILI) with pollen concentrations and meteorological data. Finally, a predictive model is tested using pollen and meteorological threshold values inversely correlated to flu-like incidence.\n\nWe found a highly significant inverse correlation of r(224)= -0.41 (p < 0.001) between pollen and changes in flu-like incidence corrected for incubation period. The correlation was stronger after taking into account incubation time. We found that our predictive model has the highest inverse correlation with changes in flu-like incidence of r(222) = -0.48 (p < 0.001) when average thresholds of 610 total pollen grains/m3, 120 allergenic pollen grains/m3, and a solar radiation of 510 J/cm2 are passed. The passing of at least the pollen thresholds, preludes the beginning and end of flu-like seasons. Solar radiation is a co-inhibitor of flu-like incidence, temperature makes no difference, and higher relative humidity associates even with flu-like incidence increases.\n\nWe conclude that pollen is a predictor of the inverse seasonality of flu-like epidemics including COVID-19, and that solar radiation is a co-inhibitor. The observed seasonality of COVID-19 during Spring, suggests that COVID-19 may revive in The Netherlands after week 33, preceded by the relative absence of pollen, and follows pollen-flu seasonality patterns.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesTo report the reduction in new neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) referrals during the COVID-19 pandemic and estimate the impact of delayed treatment on visual outcomes at one year.\n\nDesignRetrospective clinical audit and simulation model.\n\nSettingMultiple UK NHS ophthalmology centres.\n\nParticipantsData on the reduction in new nAMD referrals was obtained from four NHS Trusts in England comparing April 2020 to April 2019. To estimate the potential impact on one-year visual outcomes, a stratified bootstrap simulation model was developed drawing on an electronic medical records dataset of 20,825 nAMD eyes from 27 NHS Trusts.\n\nMain outcome measuresSimulated mean visual acuity and proportions of eyes with vision [&le;]6/60, [&le;]6/24 and [&ge;]6/12 at one year under four hypothetical scenarios: no treatment delay, 3, 6 and 9-month treatment delays. Estimated additional number of eyes with vision [&le;]6/60 at one year nationally.\n\nResultsThe number of nAMD referrals at four major eye treatment hospital groups based in England dropped on average by 72% (range 65 to 87%) in April 2020 compared to April 2019. Simulated one-year visual outcomes for 1000 nAMD eyes with a 3-month treatment delay suggested an increase in the proportion of eyes with vision [&le;]6/60 from 15.5% (13.2 to 17.9) to 23.3% (20.7 to25.9), and a decrease in the proportion of eyes with vision [&ge;]6/12 (driving vision) from 35.1% (32.1 to 38.1) to 26.4% (23.8 to29.2). Outcomes worsened incrementally with longer modelled delays. Assuming nAMD referrals are reduced to this level at the national level for only one month, these simulated results suggest an additional 186-365 eyes with vision [&le;]6/60 at one-year with even a short treatment delay.\n\nConclusionsWe report a large decrease in nAMD referrals during the first month of COVID-19 lockdown and provide an important public health message regarding the risk of delayed treatment. As a conservative estimate, a treatment delay of 3 months could lead to a >50% relative increase in the number of eyes with vision [&le;]6/60 and 25% relative decrease in the number of eyes with driving vision at one year.",

    "abstract": "This paper deals with the mathematical modeling and numerical simulations related to the coronavirus dynamics. A description is developed based on the framework of susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed model. Removed population is split into recovered and death populations allowing a better comprehension of real situations. Besides, total population is reduced based on the number of deaths. Hospital infrastructure is also included into the mathematical description allowing the consideration of collapse scenarios. Initially, a model verification is carried out calibrating system parameters with data from China outbreak that is considered a benchmark due the availability of data for the entire cycle. Afterward, numerical simulations are performed to analyze COVID-19 dynamics in Brazil. Results show several scenarios showing the importance of social isolation. System dynamics has a strong sensitivity to transmission rate showing the importance of numerical simulations to guide public health decision strategies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOne of the significant unanswered questions about COVID-19 epidemiology relates to the role of children in transmission. In this study we estimate susceptibility and infectivity of children compared to those of adults. Understanding the age-structured transmission dynamics of the outbreak provides precious and timely information to guide epidemic modelling and public health policy.\n\nMethodsData were collected from households in the city of Bnei Brak, Israel, in which all household members were tested for COVID-19 using PCR. To estimate relative transmission parameters in the absence of data on who infected whom, we developed an estimation method based on a discrete stochastic dynamic model of the spread of the epidemic within a household. The model describes the propagation of the disease between household members allowing for susceptibility and infectivity parameters to vary among two age groups. The parameter estimates are obtained by a maximum likelihood method, where the likelihood function is computed based on the stochastic model via simulations.\n\nFindingsInspection of the data reveals that children are less likely to become infected compared to adults (25% of children infected over all households, 44% of adults infected over all households, excluding index cases), and the chances of becoming infected increases with age. An interesting exception is that infants up to age one year are more likely to be infected than children between one and four. Using our modelling approach, we estimate that the susceptibility of children (under 20 years old) is 45% [40%, 55%] of the susceptibility of adults. The infectivity of children was estimated to be 85% [65%, 110%] relative to that of adults.\n\nInterpretationIt is widely observed that the percentage of children within confirmed cases is low. A common explanation is that children who are infected are less likely to develop symptoms than adults, and thus are less likely to be tested. We estimate that children are less susceptible to infection, which is an additional factor explaining their relatively low rate of occurrence within confirmed cases. Moreover, our results indicate that children, when infected, are somewhat less prone to infect others compared to adults; however, this result is not statistically significant.\n\nThe resulting estimates of susceptibility and infectivity of children compared to adults are crucial for deciding on appropriate interventions, and for controlling the epidemic outbreak and its progress. These estimates can guide age-dependent public health policy such as school closure and opening. However, while our estimates of childrens susceptibility and infectivity are lower than those of adults within a household, it is important to bear in mind that their role in the spread of COVID-19 outside the household, is also affected by different contact patterns and hygiene habits.",

    "abstract": "A simplified model applied to COVID-19 cases detected and officially published by the italian government [1], seems to fit quite well the time evolution of the disease in Italy during the period feb-24th - may-19th 2020.\n\nThe hypothesis behind the model is based on the fact that in the lockdown period the infection cannot be transmitted due to social isolation and, more generally, due to the strong protection measures in place during the observation period. In this case a compartment model is used and the interactions between the different compartments are simplified. The sample of cases detected is intended as a set of individuals susceptible to infection which, after being exposed and undergoing the infection, were isolated ( treated) in such a way they can no longer spread the infection.\n\nThe values obtained are to be considered indicative.\n\nThe same model has been applied both to the data relating to Italy and to some regions of Italy (Lombardia, Piemonte, Lazio, Campania, Calabria, Sicilia, Sardegna), generally finding a good response and indicatively interesting values (see chap. 5).\n\nThe only tuning parameter is the  incubation period{tau} that, together with the calculated growth rate{kappa} of the exponential curve used to approximate the early stage data, in this modelization, are in strong relationship with the compartments transfer rates.\n\nIn particular[R] 0 and the numerical value of{kappa} (dimensionless) in this model are linked by the relation:[R] 0 = 1/{kappa}2\n\nRevision HistoryO_ST_ABSRevision # 1C_ST_ABSO_LIErrata corrige in section 1 (Introduction): the equations that summarize the relationship between the parameters were wrong.

    "abstract": "BackgroundHigh level stress is expected when crises starts affecting peoples lives and communities which is witnessed in the past epidemics. Infectious diseases outbreaks like the ongoing COVID19 pandemic have negative impact on healthcare workers (HCWs) mental health, which needs to be investigated. Therefore, we aimed to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 on frontline HCWs and their coping strategies.\n\nMethodsA web-based, cross-sectional study was conducted among HCWs of the Punjab province of Pakistan. The generalized anxiety scale (GAD-7), patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Brief-COPE were used to assess anxiety, depression and coping strategies.\n\nResultsThe mean age of respondents (N = 398) was 28.67 {+/-} 4.15 years, with majority of medical doctors (52%). The prevalence of anxiety and depression were 21.4% and 21.9%, respectively. There was no significant difference of anxiety and depression scores among doctors, nurses and pharmacists. Females had significantly higher anxiety (p = 0.003) and depression (p = 0.001) scores than males. Moreover, HCWs performing duties in COVID-19 ICU had significantly higher anxiety score than those from isolation wards (p = 0.020) and other departments (p = 0.014). Depression, not anxiety, score were higher among those who did not receive the infection prevention training. Most frequently adopted coping strategy was religious coping (5.98 {+/-} 1.73) followed by acceptance (5.59 {+/-} 1.55) and coping planning (4.91 {+/-} 1.85).\n\nConclusionA considerable proportion of HCWs are having generalized anxiety and depression during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings call for interventions to mitigate mental health risks in HCWs.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 caused a global pandemic with a viral infection called COVID-19. The disease usually causes respiratory symptoms but in a small proportion of patients can lead to a pneumonitis, Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome and death. Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (IMV) is considered a life-saving treatment for COVID-19 patients and a huge demand for IMV devices was reported globally. This review aims to provide insight on the initial IMV practices for COVID-19 patients in the initial phase of the pandemic.\n\nMethodsElectronic databases (Embase and MEDLINE) were searched for applicable articles using relevant keywords. The references of included articles were hand searched. Articles that reported the use of IMV in adult COVID-19 patients were included in the review. The NIH quality assessment tool for cohort and cross-sectional studies was used to appraise studies.\n\nResults106 abstracts were identified from the databases search, of which 16 were included. 4 studies were included in the meta-analysis. In total, 9988 patients were included across all studies. The overall cases of COVID-19 requiring IMV ranged from 2-75%. Increased age and pre-existing comorbidities increased the likelihood of IMV requirement. The reported mortality rate in patients receiving IMV ranged between 50-100%. On average, IMV was required and initiated between 10-10.5 days from symptoms onset. When invasively ventilated, COVID-19 patients required IMV for a median of 10-17 days across studies. Little information was provided on ventilatory protocols or management strategies and were inconclusive.\n\nConclusionIn these initial reporting studies for the first month of the pandemic, patients receiving IMV were older and had more pre-existing co-morbidities than those who did not require IMV. The mortality rate was high in COVID-19 patients who received IMV. Studies are needed to evaluate protocols and modalities of IMV to improve outcomes and identify the populations most likely to benefit from IMV.",

    "abstract": "Covid-19 death has a different relationship with age than is the case for other severe respiratory pathogens. The Covid-19 death rate increases exponentially with age, and the main risk factors are age itself, as well as having underlying conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, severe chronic respiratory disease and cancer. Furthermore, the almost complete lack of deaths in children suggests that infection alone is not sufficient to cause death; rather, one must have gone through a number of changes, either as a result of undefined aspects of aging, or as a result of chronic disease. These characteristics of Covid-19 death are consistent with the multistep model of disease, a model which has primarily been used for cancer, and more recently for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We applied the multi-step model to data on Covid-19 case fatality rates (CFRs) from China, South Korea, Italy, Spain and Japan. In all countries we found that a plot of ln (CFR) against ln (age) was approximately linear with a slope of about 5. As a comparison, we also conducted similar analyses for selected other respiratory diseases. SARS showed a similar log-log age-pattern to that of Covid-19, albeit with a lower slope, whereas seasonal and pandemic influenza showed quite different age-patterns. Thus, death from Covid-19 and SARS appears to follow a distinct age-pattern, consistent with a multistep model of disease that in the case of Covid-19 is probably defined by comorbidities and age producing immune-related susceptibility. Identification of these steps would be potentially important for prevention and therapy for SARS-COV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "A key question in COVID-19 infection is why some previously healthy patients develop severe pulmonary failure and some ultimately die. Initial pulmonary failure does not exhibit classical features of ARDS; hypercoagulability is a common laboratory feature, and pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy has been reported post mortem1,2,3. Biomarkers cannot robustly identify such patients pre-emptively and no specific interventions exist to mitigate clinical deterioration. Mononuclear phagocytic cells are key immune cells and bind fibrinogen through the CD11b/CD18 dimer CR3, whose activated form can initiate microthrombus formation. Accordingly, we profiled circulating monocyte CD11b/CD18 cell surface density from COVID-19 infected adults who were (i) symptomatic but breathless, (ii) requiring ventilatory support, and (iii) recovering following ICU care for hypoxia.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCancer and multiple non-cancer conditions are considered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as high risk conditions in the COVID-19 emergency. Professional societies have recommended changes in cancer service provision to minimize COVID-19 risks to cancer patients and health care workers. However, we do not know the extent to which cancer patients, in whom multi-morbidity is common, may be at higher overall risk of mortality as a net result of multiple factors including COVID-19 infection, changes in health services, and socioeconomic factors.\n\nMethodsWe report multi-center, weekly cancer diagnostic referrals and chemotherapy treatments until April 2020 in England and Northern Ireland. We analyzed population-based health records from 3,862,012 adults in England to estimate 1-year mortality in 24 cancer sites and 15 non-cancer comorbidity clusters (40 conditions) recognized by CDC as high-risk. We estimated overall (direct and indirect) effects of COVID-19 emergency on mortality under different Relative Impact of the Emergency (RIE) and different Proportions of the population Affected by the Emergency (PAE). We applied the same model to the US, using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program data.\n\nResultsWeekly data until April 2020 demonstrate significant falls in admissions for chemotherapy (45-66% reduction) and urgent referrals for early cancer diagnosis (70-89% reduction), compared to pre-emergency levels. Under conservative assumptions of the emergency affecting only people with newly diagnosed cancer (incident cases) at COVID-19 PAE of 40%, and an RIE of 1.5, the model estimated 6,270 excess deaths at 1 year in England and 33,890 excess deaths in the US. In England, the proportion of patients with incident cancer with [&ge;]1 comorbidity was 65.2%. The number of comorbidities was strongly associated with cancer mortality risk. Across a range of model assumptions, and across incident and prevalent cancer cases, 78% of excess deaths occur in cancer patients with Harry [&ge;]1 comorbidity.\n\nConclusionWe provide the first estimates of potential excess mortality among people with cancer and multimorbidity due to the COVID-19 emergency and demonstrate dramatic changes in cancer services. To better inform prioritization of cancer care and guide policy change, there is an urgent need for weekly data on cause-specific excess mortality, cancer diagnosis and treatment provision and better intelligence on the use of effective treatments for comorbidities.",

    "abstract": "The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has reached nearly every country in the world with extraordinary person-to-person transmission. The most likely original source of the virus was spillover from an animal reservoir and subsequent adaptation to humans sometime during the winter of 2019 in Wuhan Province, China. Because of its genetic similarity to SARS-CoV-1, it is likely that this novel virus has a similar host range and receptor specificity. Due to concern for human-pet transmission, we investigated the susceptibility of domestic cats and dogs to infection and potential for infected cats to transmit to naive cats. We report that cats are highly susceptible to subclinical infection, with a prolonged period of oral and nasal viral shedding that is not accompanied by clinical signs, and are capable of direct contact transmission to other cats. These studies confirm that cats are susceptible to productive SARS-CoV-2 infection, but are unlikely to develop clinical disease. Further, we document that cats develop a robust neutralizing antibody response that prevented re-infection to a second viral challenge. Conversely, we found that dogs do not shed virus following infection, but do mount an anti-viral neutralizing antibody response. There is currently no evidence that cats or dogs play a significant role in human exposure; however, reverse zoonosis is possible if infected owners expose their domestic pets during acute infection. Resistance to re-exposure holds promise that a vaccine strategy may protect cats, and by extension humans, to disease susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "In response to the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, the U.S. has largely delegated implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to local governments on the state and county level. This staggered implementation combined with the heterogeneity of the U.S. complicates quantification the effect of NPIs on the reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nWe describe a data-driven approach to quantify the effect of NPIs that relies on county-level similarities to specialize a Bayesian mechanistic model based on observed fatalities. Using this approach, we estimate change in reproductive rate, Rt, due to implementation of NPIs in 1,417 U.S. counties.\n\nWe estimate that as of May 28th, 2020 1,177 out of the considered 1,417 U.S. counties have reduced the reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2 to below 1.0. The estimated effect of any individual NPI, however, is different across counties. Stay-at-home orders were estimated as the only effective NPI in metropolitan and urban counties, while advisory NPIs were estimated to be effective in more rural counties. The expected level of infection predicted by the model ranges from 0 to 28.7% and is far from herd immunity even in counties with advanced spread.\n\nOur results suggest that local conditions are pertinent to containment and re-opening decisions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn order to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK government has imposed strict physical distancing ( lockdown) measures including school  dismissals since 23 March 2020. As evidence is emerging that these measures may have slowed the spread of the pandemic, it is important to assess the impact of any changes in strategy, including scenarios for school reopening and broader relaxation of social distancing. This work uses an individual-based model to predict the impact of a suite of possible strategies to reopen schools in the UK, including that currently proposed by the UK government.\n\nMethodsWe use Covasim, a stochastic agent-based model for transmission of COVID-19, calibrated to the UK epidemic. The model describes individuals contact networks stratified as household, school, work and community layers, and uses demographic and epidemiological data from the UK. We simulate a range of different school reopening strategies with a society-wide relaxation of lockdown measures and in the presence of different non-pharmaceutical interventions, to estimate the number of new infections, cumulative cases and deaths, as well as the effective reproduction number with different strategies. To account for uncertainties within the stochastic simulation, we also simulated different levels of infectiousness of children and young adults under 20 years old compared to older ages.\n\nFindingsWe found that with increased levels of testing of people (between 25% and 72% of symptomatic people tested at some point during an active COVID-19 infection depending on scenarios) and effective contact-tracing and isolation for infected individuals, an epidemic rebound may be prevented across all reopening scenarios, with the effective reproduction number (R) remaining below one and the cumulative number of new infections and deaths significantly lower than they would be if testing did not increase. If UK schools reopen in phases from June 2020, prevention of a second wave would require testing 51% of symptomatic infections, tracing of 40% of their contacts, and isolation of symptomatic and diagnosed cases. However, without such measures, reopening of schools together with gradual relaxing of the lockdown measures are likely to induce a secondary pandemic wave, as are other scenarios for reopening. When infectiousness of <20 year olds was varied from 100% to 50% of that of older ages, our findings remained unchanged.\n\nInterpretationTo prevent a secondary COVID-19 wave, relaxation of social distancing including reopening schools in the UK must be implemented alongside an active large-scale population-wide testing of symptomatic individuals and effective tracing of their contacts, followed by isolation of symptomatic and diagnosed individuals. Such combined measures have a greater likelihood of controlling the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and preventing a large number of COVID-19 deaths than reopening schools and society with the current level of implementation of testing and isolation of infected individuals.\n\nResearch in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSince the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, mathematical modelling has been at the heart of informing decision-making, including the imposing of the lockdown in the UK. As countries are now starting to plan modification of these measures, it is important to assess the impact of different lockdown exit strategies including whether and how to reopen schools and relax other social distancing measures.\n\nAdded value of this studyUsing mathematical modelling, we explored the impact of strategies to reopen schools and society in the UK, including that currently proposed by the UK government. We assessed the impact of opening all schools fully or in a phased way with only some school years going back, with a society-wide relaxation of lockdown measures and in the presence of a different levels of implementation of test-trace-isolate strategies. We projected the number of new COVID-19 infections, cumulative cases and deaths, as well as the temporal distribution in the effective reproduction number (R) across different strategies. Our study is the first to provide quantification of the amount of testing and tracing that would be needed to prevent a second wave of COVID-19 in the UK under different reopening scenarios. To account for uncertainties within the stochastic simulation, we also simulated different levels of infectiousness of children and young adults under 20 years old compared to older ages.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceEvidence to date points to the need for additional testing, contact tracing, and isolation of individuals who have either been diagnosed with COVID-19, or who are considered to be at high risk of carrying infection due to their contact history or symptoms. Our study supports these conclusions and provides additional quantification of the amount of testing and tracing that would be needed to prevent a second wave of COVID-19 in the UK under different lockdown exit strategies. Reopening schools and society alongside active testing of the symptomatic population (between 25% and 72% of people with symptomatic COVID-19 infection depending on scenarios) and with an effective contact-tracing and rapid isolation of symptomatic and diagnosed individuals, will not only prevent a secondary pandemic wave, but is also likely to be able to control the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, via keeping the R value below 1, thus preventing a large number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. However, in the absence of fully implemented large-scale testing, contact-tracing and isolation strategy, plans for reopening schools, including those currently proposed by the UK government, and the associated increase in work and community contacts, are likely to induce a secondary pandemic wave of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEarly detection and risk mitigation efforts are essential for averting large outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2. Active surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 can aid in early detection of outbreaks, but the testing frequency required to identify an outbreak at its earliest stage is unknown. We assess what testing frequency is required to detect an outbreak before there are 10 detectable infections.\n\nMethodsA dynamic compartmental transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 was developed to simulate spread among a university community. After introducing a single infection into a fully susceptible population, we calculate the probability of detecting at least one case on each succeeding day with various NAT testing frequencies (daily testing achieving 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the population tested per month) assuming an 85% test sensitivity. A proportion of infected individuals (varied from 1-60%) are assumed to present to health services (HS) for symptomatic testing. We ascertain the expected number of detectable infections in the community when there is a > 90% probability of detecting at least 1 case. Sensitivity analyses examine impact of transmission rates (Rt = 0 = 2, 2.5,3), presentation to HS (1%/5%/30%/60%), and pre-existing immunity (0%/10%)\n\nResultsAssuming an 85% test sensitivity, identifying an outbreak with 90% probability when the expected number of detectable infections is 9 or fewer requires NAT testing of 100% of the population per month; this result holds for all transmission rates and all levels of presentation at health services we considered. If 1% of infected people present at HS and Rt=0=3, testing 75%/50%/25% per month could identify an outbreak when the expected numbers of detectable infections are 12/17/30 respectively; these numbers decline to 9/11/12 if 30% of infected people present at HS. As proportion of infected individuals present at health services increases, the marginal impact of active surveillance is reduced. Higher transmission rates result in shorter time to detection but also rapidly escalating cases without intervention. Little differences were observed with 10% pre-existing immunity.\n\nConclusionsWidespread testing of 100% of the campus population every month is required to detect an outbreak when there are fewer than 9 detectable infections for the scenarios examined, but high presentation of symptomatic people at HS can compensate in part for lower levels of testing. Early detection is necessary, but not sufficient, to curtail disease outbreaks; the proposed testing rates would need to be accompanied by case isolation, contact tracing, quarantine, and other risk mitigation and social distancing interventions.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThis study aims to critically assess the published studies of Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for the treatment of COVID-19 and provide recommendations for future clinical trials for the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMethodA rapid systematic review was conducted by searching the PubMed, Embase, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases on April 13, 2020. Three clinical trial registry platforms, including ClinicalTrials.gov, the EU Clinical Trials Register, and the Chinese Clinical Trial Register were also complementarily searched.\n\nResultsA total of 10 clinical studies were identified, including 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 1 comparative nonrandomized trial, 5 single-arm trials, and 1 interim analysis. The heterogeneity among studies of the baseline disease severity and reported endpoints made a pooled analysis impossible. CQ and HCQ (with or without azithromycin) showed significant therapeutic benefit in terms of virologic clearance rate, improvement in symptoms and imaging findings, time to clinical recovery, and length of hospital stay in 1 RCT, 4 single-arm trials, and the interim analysis, whereas no treatment benefit of CQ or HCQ was observed in the remaining 4 studies. Limitations of the included studies ranged from small sample size, to insufficient information concerning baseline patient characteristics, to potential for selection bias without detailing the rationale for exclusion, and presence of confounding factors.\n\nConclusionBased on the studies evaluated, there still lacked solid evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of HCQ and CQ as a treatment for COVID-19 with or without azithromycin. This emphasized the importance of robust RCTs investing HCQ/CQ to address the evidence uncertainties.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDSmokers are generally more susceptible to infectious respiratory diseases and are at higher risk of developing severe complications from these infections. Conflicting reports exist regarding the impact of smoking on the risk of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\nMETHODSWe carried out a population-based study among over 3,000,000 adult members of Clalit Health Services, the largest health provider in Israel. Since the beginning of the disease outbreak, and until May 16, 2020, over 145,000 adults underwent RT-PCR testing for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and 3.3% had positive results. We performed a case-control study among patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing, to assess the impact of smoking on infection incidence and severity. Individuals with positive tests were matched in a 1:5 ratio to individuals tested negative, of the same sex, age, and ethnicity/religion. Conditional logistic regressions were performed to evaluate odds ratios for current and previous smoking on the risk of testing positive. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed among patients infected with COVID-19 to estimate the association between smoking and fatal or severe disease requiring ventilation. Regressions were performed with and without adjustment for preexisting medical conditions.\n\nRESULTSCurrent smokers (9.8%) were significantly less prevalent among members tested positive compared to the general population (19.4%, P<0.001), and to matched members tested negative (18.2%, P<0.001). Current smoking was associated with significantly reduced odds ratio (OR) for testing positive OR=0.447 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.400-0.501). Among patients tested positive, there was no evidence of significantly increased risk of developing severe or fatal disease.\n\nCONCLUSIONThe risk of infection by COVID-19 appears to be reduced by half among current smokers. This intriguing finding may reveal unique infection mechanisms present for COVID-19 which may be targeted to combat the disease and reduce its infection rate.",

    "abstract": "On March 17, 2020, French authorities implemented a nationwide lockdown to respond to COVID-19 epidemic emergency and curb the surge of patients requiring critical care, similarly to other countries. Evaluating the impact of lockdown on population mobility is important to help characterize the changes in social dynamics that affected viral diffusion. Using travel flows reconstructed from mobile phone trajectories, we measured how lockdown altered mobility patterns at both local and country scales. Lockdown caused a 65% reduction in countrywide number of displacements, and was particularly effective in reducing work-related short-range mobility, especially during rush hours, and recreational long-range trips. Anomalous increases in long-range movements, localized in both time and space, emerged even before lockdown announcement. Mobility drops were unevenly distributed across regions. They were strongly associated with active population, workers employed in sectors highly impacted by lockdown, and number of hospitalizations per region, and moderately associated with socio-economic level of the region. Major cities largely shrank their pattern of connectivity, reducing it mainly to short-range commuting, despite the persistence of some long-range trips. Our findings indicate that lockdown was very effective in reducing population mobility across scales. Caution should be taken in the timing of policy announcements and implementation. Individual response to policy announcements may generate unexpected anomalous behaviors increasing the risk of geographical diffusion. On the other hand, risk awareness may be beneficial in further decreasing mobility in largely affected regions. Our findings help predicting how and where restrictions will be the most effective in reducing the mobility and mixing of the population, thus aiding tuning recommendations in the upcoming weeks, when phasing out lockdown.",

The most frequently recorded 100 data elements were identified across all studies and are presented with relative frequencies. Categories with the largest numbers of common elements included demographics, admission criteria, medical history and investigations. Mortality and need for specific respiratory support were the most common outcome measures, but with specific studies including a range of other outcome measures.\n\nConclusionThe findings of this study have demonstrated that it is feasible to collate specific data elements recorded across a range of studies investigating a specific clinical condition in order to identify those elements which are most common among studies. These data may be of value for those establishing new studies and to allow researchers to rapidly identify studies collecting data of potential use hence minimising duplication and increasing data re-use and interoperability",

    "abstract": "Backgroundcontroversy has arisen in the scientific community on whether the use of renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors in the context of COVID-19 would be of benefit or harmful. A meta-analysis of eligible studies comparing the occurrence of severe and fatal COVID-19 in infected patients who were under treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) vs no treatment or other antihypertensives was conducted.\n\nMethodsPubMed, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Library, MedRxiv and BioRxiv were searched for relevant studies. Fixed-effect models or random-effect models were used depending on the heterogeneity between estimates.\n\nResultsa total of fifteen studies with 21,614 patients were included. The use of RAS inhibitors was associated with a non-significant 20% decreased risk of the composite outcome (death, admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation requirement or progression to severe or critical pneumonia): RR 0.81 (95%CI: 0.631.04), p=0.10, I2=82%. In a subgroup analysis that included hypertensive subjects only, ACEI/ARB were associated with a 27% significant decrease in the risk of the composite outcome (RR 0.73 (95%CI: 0.56 0.96), p=0.02, I2=65%).\n\nConclusionthe results of this pooled analysis suggest that the use of ACEI/ARB does not worsen the prognosis, and could even be protective in hypertensive subjects. Patients should continue these drugs during their COVID-19 illness.",

    "abstract": "Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular entry point for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) - the cause of COVID-19 disease. It has been hypothesized that use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibiting medications in patients with hypertension, increases the expression of ACE2 and thereby increases the risk of COVID-19 infection and severe outcomes or death. However, the effect of RAS-inhibition on ACE2 expression in human tissues of key relevance to blood pressure regulation and COVID-19 infection has not previously been reported.\n\nWe examined how hypertension, its major metabolic co-phenotypes and antihypertensive medications relate to ACE2 renal expression using information from up to 436 patients whose kidney transcriptomes were characterised by RNA-sequencing. We further validated some of the key observations in other human tissues and/or a controlled experimental model. Our data reveal increasing expression of ACE2 with age in both human lungs and the kidney. We show no association between renal expression of ACE2 and either hypertension or common types of RAS inhibiting drugs. We demonstrate that renal abundance of ACE2 is positively associated with a biochemical index of kidney function and show a strong enrichment for genes responsible for kidney health and disease in ACE2 co-expression analysis.\n\nCollectively, our data indicate that neither hypertension nor antihypertensive treatment are likely to alter individual risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or influence clinical outcomes in COVID-19 through changes of ACE2 expression. Our data further suggest that in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, kidney ACE2 is most likely nephro-protective but the age-related increase in its expression within lungs and kidneys may be relevant to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic is creating significant challenges for healthcare infrastructure for countries of all development and resource levels. Low-and-middle resource countries face even larger challenges, as their resources are stretched and often insufficient under normal circumstances. A village in the Papuan highlands of Indonesia; small, isolated, accessed only by small plane or trekking has experienced an outbreak typical of COVID-19.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsThis description was compiled from patient care records by lay healthcare workers in M20 (a pseudonym) during and after an outbreak and from medical doctors responding to online requests for help. We assume that, for reasons given, the outbreak that has been described was COVID-19. The dense social structure of the village resulted in a rapid infection of 90-95% of the population. Physical distancing and isolation measures were used, but probably implemented suboptimal and too late, and their effect on the illness course was unclear. The relatively young population, with a majority of women, probably influenced the impact of the epidemic, resulting in only two deaths so far.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceThis outbreak pattern of suspected SARS-CoV-2 in a village in the highlands of Papua (Indonesia) presents a unique report of the infection of an entire village population over five weeks. The age distribution, common in Papuan highland villages may have reduced case fatality rate (CFR) in this context and that might be the case in similar remote areas since survival to old age is already very limited and CFR among younger people is lower.\n\nAuthor summaryA village in the Papuan highlands of Indonesia; small, isolated, accessed only by small plane or trekking has experienced an outbreak typical of COVID-19. The outbreak affected 90-95% of approximately 200 residents between 20 February 2020 and 31 March 2020. Lay health workers, consisting of trained local volunteers, without healthcare facilities and limited medication options reached out for help online and managed with what they had available. Their experience is relevant to others in similar settings. This report describes the village, outbreak, timeline, symptoms and treatments, and outcomes.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the lockdowns introduced in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK and also explores the potential consequences of different degrees of relaxation. The analysis employs a two-stage SEIR model with different reproductive numbers pre-and post-lockdown. These parameters are estimated from data on the daily number of confirmed cases in a process that automatically detects the time at which the lockdown became effective. The model is evaluated by considering its predictive accuracy on current data and it is then deployed to explore partial relaxations. The results indicate that the different countries have been successful in reducing the reproductive number to values ranging from 0.67 (95% CI: 0.64 - 0.70) to 0.92 (95% CI: 0.89 - 0.95). Results also suggest that a relaxation of 25% could halt the decline incases in all five countries, while a 50% relaxation could lead to second peaks that are higher and last longer than the earlier peaks in each country. Even though the relaxations so far may have preserved the success of the lockdowns, vigilance is still needed. A relaxation of around 10-15% is recommended if COVID-19 is to continue to decline in all five countries.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIdentification of less costly and accurate methods for monitoring novel coronavirus disease 2019 (CoViD-19) transmission has attracted much interest in recent times. Here, we evaluated a pooling method to determine if this could improve screening efficiency and reduce costs while maintaining accuracy in Guangzhou, China.\n\nMethodsWe evaluated 8097 throat swap samples collected from individuals who came for a health check-up or fever clinic in The Third Affiliated Hospital, Southern Medical University between March 4, 2020 and April 26, 2020. Samples were screened for CoViD-19 infection using the WHO-approved quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) primers. The positive samples were classified into two groups (high or low) based on viral load in accordance with the CT value of COVID-19 RT-qPCR results. Each positive RNA samples were mixed with COVID-19 negative RNA or ddH2O to form RNA pools.\n\nFindingsSamples with high viral load could be detected in pool negative samples (up to 1/1000 dilution fold). In contrast, the detection of RNA sample from positive patients with low viral load in a pool was difficult and not repeatable.\n\nInterpretationOur results show that the COVID-19 viral load significantly influences in pooling efficacy. COVID-19 has distinct viral load profile which depends on the timeline of infection. Thus, application of pooling for infection surveillance may lead to false negatives and hamper infection control efforts.\n\nFundingNational Natural Science Foundation of China; Hong Kong Scholars Program, Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSince it emergence in late 2019, CoViD-19 has dramatically increased the burden healthcare system worldwide. A research letter titled \"Sample Pooling as a Strategy to Detect Community Transmission of SARS-CoV-2\" which was recently published in JAMA journal proposed that sample pooling could be used for SARS-COV-2 community surveillance. Currently, the need for large-scale testing increases the number of 2019-nCOV nucleic acid analysis required for proper policy-making especially as work and normal school resumes. As far as we know, there are many countries and regions in the world, who are beginning to try this strategy for nucleic acid screening of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nAdded value of this studyWe carried out a study using pooled samples formed from SARS-COV-2 negative samples and positive samples with high or low viral and assessed detection rate for the positive samples. We found that positive sample with high viral load could be detected in pools in a wide range of dilution folds (ranging from1/2 to 1/50). On the contrary, the sample with low viral load could only be detected in RNA \"pools\" at very low dilution ratio, and the repeatability was unsatisfactory. Our results show the application of the \"pooling\" strategy for large-scale community surveillance requires careful consideration and depends on the viral load of the positive samples.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceAlthough the number of newly diagnosed cases has been reducing in some parts of the world, the possibility of a second wave of infection has made quick and efficient data gathering essential for policy-making, isolation and treatment of patients. Fast and efficient nucleic acid detection methods are encouraged, but sample pooling as a strategy of SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid screening increased the false-negative rate, especially those with asymptomatic infections have lower viral load. Therefore, the application of the \"pooling\" strategy for large-scale community surveillance requires careful consideration by policy makers.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe degree to which children and young people are infected by and transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus is unclear. Clinical series and testing cohorts based upon screening of symptomatic cases provide biased estimates of susceptibility in children. The role of children and young people in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on susceptibility, symptoms, viral load, social contact patterns and behaviour.\n\nMethodsWe undertook a rapid systematic review of contact-tracing studies and population-screening studies to address the question \"What is the susceptibility to and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by children and adolescents compared with adults?\" We searched PubMed and medRxiv on 16 May 2020 and identified 6327 studies, with additional studies identified through handsearching of cited references (2) and professional contacts (4). We assessed quality, summarized findings and undertook a random effects meta-analysis of contact-tracing studies.\n\nResults18 studies met inclusion criteria; 9 contact-tracing, 8 population-screening and 1 systematic-review. Studies were of predominantly low and medium quality. Meta-analysis of contact tracing studies showed that the pooled odds ratio of being an infected contact in children compared with adults for all contact tracing studies was 0.44 (0.29, 0.69) with substantial heterogeneity (63%). Findings from a systematic review of household clusters of COVID-19 found 3/31 (10%) were due to a child index case and a population-based school contact tracing study found minimal transmission by child or teacher index cases. Findings from population-screening studies were heterogenous, included both infection prevalence and seroprevalence studies, and were not suitable for meta-analysis. Large studies from Iceland, the Netherlands and Spain and an Italian municipal study showed markedly lower prevalence amongst children and young people, however studies from Stockholm, England and municipalities in Switzerland and Germany showed no difference in prevalence between adults and children.\n\nConclusionsThere is preliminary evidence that children and young people have lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, with a 56% lower odds of being an infected contact. There is weak evidence that children and young people play a lesser role in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at a population level. Our study provides no information on the infectivity of children.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUp to 80% of active SARS-CoV-2 infections are proposed to be asymptomatic based on cross-sectional studies. However, accurate estimates of the asymptomatic proportion require systematic detection and follow-up to differentiate between truly asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases. We conducted a rapid review and meta-analysis of current evidence regarding the asymptomatic proportion of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections based on methodologically-appropriate studies in community settings.\n\nMethodsWe searched Medline and EMBASE for peer-reviewed articles, and BioRxiv and MedRxiv for pre-prints published prior to 05/05/2020. We included studies based in community settings that involved systematic PCR testing on participants and follow-up symptom monitoring regardless of symptom status. We extracted data on study characteristics, frequencies of PCR-confirmed infections by symptom status, and (if available) cycle threshold values and/or duration of viral shedding by symptom status. We computed estimates of the asymptomatic proportion and 95% confidence intervals for each study and overall using random effect meta-analysis.\n\nFindingsWe screened 270 studies and included 6. The pooled estimate for the asymptomatic proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections was 11% (95% CI 4%-18%). Estimates of baseline viral load appeared to be similar for asymptomatic and symptomatic cases based on available data in three studies, though detailed reporting of cycle threshold values and natural history of viral shedding by symptom status was limited.\n\nInterpretationThe asymptomatic proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections is relatively low when estimated from methodologically-appropriate studies. Further investigation into the degree and duration of infectiousness for asymptomatic infections is warranted.\n\nFundingMedical Research Council",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesFollowing detection of the first virologically-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Great Britain, an enhanced surveillance study was initiated by Public Health England to describe the clinical presentation, course of disease and underlying health conditions associated with infection of the first few hundred cases.\n\nMethodsInformation was collected on the first COVID-19 cases according to the First Few X WHO protocol. Case-control analyses of the sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of symptoms and underlying health conditions associated with infection were conducted. Point prevalences of underlying health conditions among the UK general population were presented.\n\nFindingsThe majority of FF100 cases were imported (51.4%), of which the majority had recent travel to Italy (71.4%). 24.7% were secondary cases acquired mainly through household contact (40.4%). Children had lower odds of COVID-19 infection compared with the general population.\n\nThe clinical presentation of cases was dominated by cough, fever and fatigue. Non-linear relationships with age were observed for fever, and sensitivity and specificity of symptoms varied by age.\n\nConditions associated with higher odds of COVID-19 infection (after adjusting for age and sex) were chronic heart disease, immunosuppression and multimorbidity.\n\nConclusionThis study presents the first epidemiological and clinical summary of COVID-19 cases in Great Britain. The FFX study design enabled systematic data collection. The study characterized underlying health conditions associated with infection and set relative risks in context with population prevalence estimates. It also provides important evidence for generating case definitions to support public health risk assessment, clinical triage and diagnostic algorithms.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNovel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infects human lung tissue cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), and the body sodium is an important factor for regulating the expression of ACE2. Through a systematic review, meta-analysis and retrospective cohort study, we found that the low blood sodium population may significantly increase the risk and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nMethodsWe extracted the data of serum sodium concentrations of patients with COVID-19 on admission from the articles published between Jan 1 and April 28, 2020, and analyzed the relationship between the serum sodium concentrations and the illness severity of patients. Then we used a cohort of 244 patients with COVID-19 for a retrospective analysis.\n\nResultsWe identified 36 studies, one of which comprised 2736 patients.The mean serum sodium concentration in patients with COVID-19 was 138.6 mmol/L, which was much lower than the median level in population (142.0). The mean serum sodium concentration in severe/critical patients (137.0) was significantly lower than those in mild and moderate patients (140.8 and 138.7, respectively). Such findings were confirmed in a retrospective cohort study, of which the mean serum sodium concentration in all patients was 137.5 mmol/L, and the significant differences were found between the mild (139.2) and moderate (137.2) patients, and the mild and severe/critical (136.6) patients. Interestingly, such changes were not obvious in the serum chlorine and potassium concentrations.\n\nConclusionsThe low sodium state of patients with COVID-19 may not be the consequence of virus infection, but could be a physiological state possibly caused by living habits such as low salt diet and during aging process, which may result in ACE2 overexpression, and increase the risk and severity of COVID-19. These findings may provide a new idea for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHealthcare professionals (HCPs) on the front lines against COVID-19 may face increased workload, and stress. Understanding HCPs risk for burnout is critical to supporting HCPs and maintaining the quality of healthcare during the pandemic.\n\nMethodsTo assess exposure, perceptions, workload, and possible burnout of HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic we conducted a cross-sectional survey. The main outcomes and measures were HCPs self-assessment of burnout and other experiences and attitudes associated with working during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFindingsA total of 2,707 HCPs from 60 countries participated in this study. Fifty-one percent of HCPs reported burnout. Burnout was associated with work impacting household activities (RR=1{middle dot}57, 95% CI=1{middle dot}39-1{middle dot}78, P<0{middle dot}001), feeling pushed beyond training (RR=1{middle dot}32, 95% CI=1{middle dot}20-1{middle dot}47, P<0{middle dot}001), exposure to COVID-19 patients (RR=1{middle dot}18, 95% CI=1{middle dot}05-1{middle dot}32, P=0{middle dot}005), making life prioritizing decisions (RR=1{middle dot}16, 95% CI=1{middle dot}02-1{middle dot}31, P=0{middle dot}03). Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) was protective against burnout (RR=0{middle dot}88, 95% CI=0{middle dot}79-0{middle dot}97, P=0{middle dot}01). Burnout was higher in high-income countries (HICs) compared to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (RR=1{middle dot}18; 95% CI=1{middle dot}02-1{middle dot}36, P=0{middle dot}018).\n\nInterpretationBurnout is prevalent at higher than previously reported rates among HCPs working during the COVID-19 pandemic and is related to high workload, job stress, and time pressure, and limited organizational support. Current and future burnout among HCPs could be mitigated by actions from healthcare institutions and other governmental and non-governmental stakeholders aimed at potentially modifiable factors, including providing additional training, organizational support, support for family, PPE, and mental health resources.\n\nFundingN/A",

All patients have been intubated in the first week from onset of ARDS and presented neurological signs of agitation and spatial disorientation after weaning from mechanical ventilation. The MRI picture and the clinical features are described. MRI lesions characteristics are unusual but demonstrate a highly consistent pattern through all the four patients with similar neurological symptoms. They do not fulfill any typical criteria for a definite neuroradiological entity. Their predominantly parieto-occipital distribution recalls posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), although the prevalent cortical involvement and diffusion MRI pattern are not typical of PRES.

    "abstract": "It is a painful job to predict the death of people. But sometimes it is important to predict the future and concern the government. A furious future is waiting for Bangladesh.\n\nObjectiveObjective of the study is to assume the number of positive case and death till 30th December, 2020 in Bangladesh.\n\nStudy designThis study was designed with systematic review and data analysis.\n\nMethodThe study was completed by analyzing data available on website. First COVID 19 case in Bangladesh was identified on 8th March. Analyzing the data increasing rate/common ratio of infection and death has been identified. Then this common ratio has been used in the formula of multiplication series (at decreasing rate). Data of China, Iran, Italy and the USA was also analyzed to assume how the death and case number increased. Social issues of Bangladesh were also analyzed. Considering all these the assumption was made.\n\nResultIt has been assumed that by the 43rd week (on 30th December, 2020) of first identification the total case can be 15640747 and total death can be 638769 by 30 December, 2020. As this is an assumption this can be true, partially true or false. But the base of assumption is strong enough so the possibility of being true or nearly true is higher.\n\nPolicy SuggestionGovernment should choose properly one between two options. Either government should declare curfew or let people lead normal life for the purpose of herd immunity. A very weak lockdown for a long time doesnt make any sense.",

The most common reason for return was respiratory distress (50%). Compared to patients who did not return, among those who returned there was a higher proportion of COPD (6.8% vs 2.9%) and hypertension (36% vs 22.1%). Patients who returned also had a shorter median length of stay (LOS) during index hospitalization (4.5 [2.9,9.1] vs. 6.7 [3.5, 11.5] days; Padjusted=0.006), and were less likely to have required intensive care on index hospitalization (5.8% vs 19%; Padjusted=0.001). A trend towards association between absence of in-hospital anticoagulation on index admission and return to hospital was also observed (20.9% vs 30.9%, Padjusted=0.064). On readmission, rates of intensive care and death were 5.8% and 3.6%, respectively.\n\nConclusionsReturn to hospital after admission for COVID-19 was infrequent within 14 days of discharge. The most common cause for return was respiratory distress. Patients who returned had higher proportion of COPD and hypertension with shorter LOS on index hospitalization, and a trend towards lower rates of in-hospital treatment-dose anticoagulation. Future studies should focus on whether these comorbid conditions, longer LOS and anticoagulation are associated with reduced readmissions.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether prevalence of Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is modulated by meteorological conditions, we herein conducted meta-regression of data in large U.S. cities. We selected 33 large U.S. cities with a population of >500,000. The integrated numbers of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the country to which the city belongs on 14 May 2020, the estimated population in 2019 in the country, and monthly meteorological conditions at the city for 4 months (from January to April 2020) were obtained. Meteorological conditions consisted of mean temperature (F), total precipitation (inch), mean wind speed (MPH), mean sky cover, and mean relative humidity (%). Monthly data for 4 months were averaged or integrated. The Covid-19 prevalence was defined as the integrated number of Covid-19 cases divided by the population. Random-effects meta-regression was performed by means of OpenMetaAnalyst. In a meta-regression graph, Covid-19 prevalence (plotted as the logarithm transformed prevalence on the y-axis) was depicted as a function of a given factor (plotted as a meteorological datum on the x-axis). A slope of the meta-regression line was significantly negative (coefficient, -0.069; P < 0.001) for the mean temperature and significantly positive for the mean wind speed (coefficient, 0.174; P = 0.027) and the sky cover (coefficient, 2.220; P = 0.023). In conclusion, lower temperature and higher wind speed/sky cover may be associated with higher Covid-19 prevalence, which should be confirmed by further epidemiological researches adjusting for various risk and protective factors (in addition to meteorological conditions) of Covid-19.",

It is a potentially fatal disease to many vulnerable patients including the elderly and those with chronic illnesses; but because this virus is a novel one, there are no firmly established treatment protocols. Many treatment methods are being investigated worldwide, and scientific conclusions drawn from these endeavors are crucial for healthcare professionals in combating this disease. In this network meta-analysis, we focus specifically on the pharmacologic agents that have been investigated for the treatment of COVID-19 and aim to produce a comprehensive picture of the evidence from current data in order to produce relevant insights on the comparative efficacy and safety profiles of various pharmacologic agents against COVID-19.",

Predictors were designed to classify patients into Deceased or Alive mortality classes and were evaluated in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC score).\n\nFindingsUsing a development cohort (n=3,841) and a systematic machine learning framework, we identified a COVID-19 mortality predictor that demonstrated high accuracy (AUC=0{middle dot}91) when applied to test sets of retrospective (n= 961) and prospective (n=249) patients. This mortality predictor was based on five clinical features: age, minimum O2 saturation during encounter, type of patient encounter (inpatient vs. various types of outpatient and telehealth encounters), hydroxychloroquine use, and maximum body temperature.\n\nInterpretationAn accurate and parsimonious COVID-19 mortality predictor based on five features may have utility in clinical settings to guide the management and prognostication of patients affected by this disease.\n\nFundingThis work was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",

Clinical characteristics that impact disease course could offer guidance for clinical decision making and future research endeavors and unveil disease pathways.\n\nObjectiveTo examine risk factors associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19.\n\nData sourcesWe performed a systematic review in PubMed from January 1 until April 19, 2020.\n\nStudy selectionObservational studies that examined the association of any clinical characteristic with an adverse clinical outcome were considered eligible. We scrutinized studies for potential overlap.\n\nData extraction and synthesisInformation on the effect of clinical factors on clinical endpoints of patients with COVID-19 was independently extracted by two researchers. When an effect size was not reported, crude odds ratios were calculated based on the available information from the eligible articles. Study-specific effect sizes from non-overlapping studies were synthesized applying the random-effects model.\n\nMain outcome and measureThe examined outcomes were severity and progression of disease, admission to ICU, need for mechanical ventilation, mortality, or a composite outcome.\n\nResultsWe identified 88 eligible articles, and we performed a total of 256 meta-analyses on the association of 98 unique risk factors with five clinical outcomes. Seven meta-analyses presented the strongest epidemiological evidence in terms of statistical significance (P-value <0.005), between-study heterogeneity (I2 <50%), sample size (more than 1000 COVID-19 patients), 95% prediction interval excluded the null value, and absence of small-study effects. Elevated C-reactive protein (OR, 6.46; 95% CI, 4.85 - 8.60), decreased lymphocyte count (OR, 4.16; 95% CI, 3.17 - 5.45), cerebrovascular disease (OR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.55 - 5.20), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 4.44; 95% CI, 2.46 - 8.02), diabetes mellitus (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.54 - 2.70), hemoptysis (OR, 7.03; 95% CI, 4.57 - 10.81), and male sex (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.30 - 1.75) were associated with risk of severe COVID-19.\n\nConclusions and relevanceOur results highlight factors that could be useful for prognostic model building, help guide patients selection for randomized clinical trials, as well as provide alternative treatment targets by shedding light to disease pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Visiting parks and gardens may attenuate the adverse physical and mental health impacts of social distancing implemented to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We quantified access to public parks and gardens in urban areas of England and Wales, and the potential for park crowdedness during periods of high use. We combined data from the Office for National Statistics and Ordnance Survey to quantify (i) the number of parks within 500 and 1,000 metres of urban postcodes (i.e., availability), (ii) the distance of postcodes to the nearest park (i.e., accessibility), and (iii) per-capita space in each park for people living within 1,000m. We examined how these measures vary by city and share of homes that are flats. Around 25.4 million people can access public parks or gardens within a ten-minute walk, while 3.8 million residents live farther away; of these 21% are children and 13% are elderly. Areas with a higher share of flats on average are closer to a park but people living in these areas are potentially less able to meet social distancing requirements while in parks during periods of high use. Cities in England and Wales can provide residents with access to green space that enables outdoor exercise and play during social distancing. Cities aiming to facilitate social distancing while keeping public green spaces open might require implementing measures such as dedicated park times for different age groups or entry allocation systems that, combined with smartphone apps or drones, can monitor and manage the total number of people using the park.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe burden and impact of healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections is unknown. We aimed to examine the utility of rapid sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 combined with detailed epidemiological analysis to investigate healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections and to inform infection control measures.\n\nMethodsWe set up rapid viral sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from PCR-positive diagnostic samples using nanopore sequencing, enabling sample-to-sequence in less than 24 hours. We established a rapid review and reporting system with integration of genomic and epidemiological data to investigate suspected cases of healthcare-associated COVID-19.\n\nResultsBetween 13 March and 24 April 2020 we collected clinical data and samples from 5191 COVID-19 patients in the East of England. We sequenced 1000 samples, producing 747 complete viral genomes. We conducted combined epidemiological and genomic analysis of 299 patients at our hospital and identified 26 genomic clusters involving 114 patients. 66 cases (57.9%) had a strong epidemiological link and 15 cases (13.2%) had a plausible epidemiological link. These results were fed back to clinical, infection control and hospital management teams, resulting in infection control interventions and informing patient safety reporting.\n\nConclusionsWe established real-time genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in a UK hospital and demonstrated the benefit of combined genomic and epidemiological analysis for the investigation of healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections. This approach enabled us to detect cryptic transmission events and identify opportunities to target infection control interventions to reduce further healthcare-associated infections.",

    "abstract": "The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) spatial distribution in Italy is inhomogeneous, because of its ways of spreading from the initial hotspots. The impact of COVID-19 on mortality has been described at the regional level, while less is known about mortality in demographic subgroups within municipalities.\n\nWe aimed to describe the excess mortality (EM) due to COVID-19 in the three most affected Italian regions, by estimating EM in subgroups defined by gender and age classes within each municipality from February 23 to March 31, 2020.\n\nEM varied widely among municipalities even within the same region; it was similar between genders for the [&ge;]75 age group, while in the other age groups it was higher in males. Thus, nearby municipalities may show a different mortality burden despite being under common regional health policies, possibly as a result of policies adopted both at the regional and at the municipality level.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has a major global health and socio-economic burden. It has instigated the mobilisation of resources into the development of control tools, such as diagnostics and vaccines. The poor performance of some diagnostic serological tools has emphasised the need for up to date immune-informatic analyses to inform the selection of viable targets for further study. This requires the integration and analysis of genetic and immunological data for SARS-CoV-2 and its homology with other human coronavirus species to understand cross-reactivity.\n\nMethodsWe have developed an online \"immuno-analytics\" resource to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 research, combining an extensive B/T-cell epitope mapping and prediction meta-analysis, and human CoV sequence homology mapping and protein database annotation, with an updated variant database and geospatial tracking for >7,800 non-synonymous mutation positions derived from >150,000 whole genome sequences. To demonstrate its utility, we present an integrated analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins, both being vaccine and serological diagnostic targets, including an analysis of changes in relevant mutation frequencies over time.\n\nResultsOur analysis reveals that the nucleocapsid protein in its native form appears to be a sub-optimal target for use in serological diagnostic platforms. The most frequent mutations were the spike protein D614G and nsp12 L314P, which were common (>86%) across all the geographical regions. Some mutations in the spike protein (e.g. A222V and L18F) have increased in frequency in Europe during the latter half of 2020, detected using our automated algorithms. The tool also suggests that orf3a proteins may be a suitable alternative target for diagnostic serologic assays in a post-vaccine surveillance setting.\n\nConclusionsThe immuno-analytics tool can be accessed online (http://genomics.lshtm.ac.uk/immuno) and will serve as a useful resource for biological discovery and surveillance in the fight against SARS-CoV-2. Further, the tool may be adapted to inform on biological targets in future outbreaks, including potential emerging human coronaviruses that spill over from animal hosts.",

Local factors that may be associated with variation in SARS-CoV-2 transmission have not been well studied.\n\nObjectiveTo examine the association of county-level factors with variation in the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number over time.\n\nDesignObservational study\n\nSetting211 counties in 46 states and the District of Columbia between February 25, 2020 and April 23, 2020.\n\nParticipantsResidents within the counties (55% of the US population)\n\nExposuresSocial distancing as measured by percent change in visits to non-essential businesses, population density, lagged daily wet bulb temperatures.\n\nMain Outcomes and MeasuresThe instantaneous reproduction number (Rt) which is the estimated number of cases generated by one case at a given time during the pandemic.\n\nResultsMedian case incidence was 1185 cases and fatality rate was 43.7 deaths per 100,000 people for the top decile of 21 counties, nearly ten times the incidence and fatality rate in the lowest density quartile. Average Rt in the first two weeks was 5.7 (SD 2.5) in the top decile, compared to 3.1 (SD 1.2) in the lowest quartile. In multivariable analysis, a 50% decrease in visits to non-essential businesses was associated with a 57% decrease in Rt (95% confidence interval, 56% to 58%). Cumulative temperature effects over 4 to 10 days prior to case incidence were nonlinear; relative Rt decreased as temperatures warmed above 32{degrees}F to 53{degrees}F, which was the point of minimum Rt, then increased between 53{degrees}F and 66{degrees}F, at which point Rt began to decrease. At 55{degrees}F, and with a 70% reduction in visits to non-essential business, 96% of counties were estimated to fall below a threshold Rt of 1.0, including 86% of counties among the top density decile and 98% of counties in the lowest density quartile.\n\nConclusions and RelevanceSocial distancing, lower population density, and temperate weather change were associated with a decreased SARS-Co-V-2 Rt in counties across the United States.

Of these county-specific factors, social distancing appeared to be the most significant in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.\n\nMeaningRt varies significantly across counties.

At the epidemiological level, this information on how infectious someone is lies embedded implicitly in the serial interval data. Other clinical indicators of infectiousness based on the temporal kinetics of the viral shedding from the nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum show the former decaying weeks sooner than the latter. In this work, we attempt to provide a better quantitative estimate for the temporal infectiousness profile using serial interval data from a combined 1251 individuals reported in the literature. We show that the infectiousness profile which we calculate correlates well with the viral shedding kinetics from nasopharyngeal swabs ({rho}=0.97, p=0.00) and culturability ({rho}=0.83, p=0.01). The profile suggests that a 68.4% (95% CI: 67.0-69.7%) of the infections are caused by infections before the symptoms appear, which is a much stronger pre-symptomatic influence than what was predicted in the literature 44% (95% CI: 25-69%) using serial data from 77 individuals.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesTo determine if specific ethnic groups are at higher risk of mortality from COVID19 infection.\n\nDesignRetrospective cohort study\n\nSettingUniversity Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHB) in Birmingham, UK\n\nParticipantsPatients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring admission to UHB between 10th March 2020 and 17th April 2020\n\nExposureEthnicity\n\nMain outcome measuresStandardised Admission Ratio (SAR) and Standardised Mortality Ratio (SMR) for each ethnicity was calculated using observed sex-specific age distributions of COVID-19 admissions/deaths and 2011 census data for Birmingham/Solihull. Hazard Ratio (aHR) for mortality was estimated for each ethnic group with white population as reference group, using Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for age, sex, social deprivation and co-morbidities, and propensity score matching.\n\nResults2217 patients admitted to UHB with a proven diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. 58.2% were male, 69.5% White and the majority (80.2%) had co-morbidities. 18.5% were of South Asian ethnicity, and these patients were more likely to be younger (median age 61 years vs.77 years), have no co-morbidities (27.8% vs. 16.6%) but a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (48.0% vs 28.2%) than White patients. SAR and SMR suggested more admissions and deaths in South Asian patients than would be predicted. South Asian patients were also more likely to present with severe disease despite no delay in presentation since symptom onset. South Asian ethnicity was associated with an increased risk of death; both by Cox regression (Hazard Ratio 1.66 (95%CI 1.32 - 2.10)) after adjusting for age, sex, deprivation and comorbidities and by propensity score matching, (Hazard ratio 1.68 (1.33-2.13), using the same factors but categorising ethnicity into South Asian or not.\n\nConclusionsCurrent evidence suggests those of South Asian ethnicity may be at risk of worse COVID-19 outcomes, further studies need to establish the underlying mechanistic pathways.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence beforeC_ST_ABSPublished studies of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic have suggested risk factors for the most severe manifestations of the disease, including increasing age, male sex and co-morbidities, especially hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. There have been observations suggesting poorer outcomes for patients of some ethnicities, and understanding this has become a global priority.\n\nAdded valueAlthough still an emerging picture, initial data from our multi-ethnic cohort suggests there are more admissions from South Asian patients than would be expected based on our population, these patients are admitted with a worse severity of COVID19 related respiratory compromise without a significant delay in presentation and experience a higher level of mortality even when differences in age, sex, deprivation and key comorbidities were taken into account. This was consistently shown using different statistical methods.\n\nImplicationsSouth Asian ethnicity may form another  at risk population from COVID-19. However, further studies are needed to better understand the underlying reasons, in particular any modifiable factors to improve outcomes as well as to refine our understanding and communication around non-modifiable risk factors.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEstablishing who is at risk from a novel rapidly arising cause of death, and why, requires a new approach to epidemiological research with very large datasets and timely data. Working on behalf of NHS England we therefore set out to deliver a secure and pseudonymised analytics platform inside the data centre of a major primary care electronic health records vendor establishing coverage across detailed primary care records for a substantial proportion of all patients in England. The following results are preliminary.\n\nData sourcesPrimary care electronic health records managed by the electronic health record vendor TPP, pseudonymously linked to patient-level data from the COVID-19 Patient Notification System (CPNS) for death of hospital inpatients with confirmed COVID-19, using the new OpenSAFELY platform.\n\nPopulation17,425,445 adults.\n\nTime period1st Feb 2020 to 25th April 2020.\n\nPrimary outcomeDeath in hospital among people with confirmed COVID-19.\n\nMethodsCohort study analysed by Cox-regression to generate hazard ratios: age and sex adjusted, and multiply adjusted for co-variates selected prospectively on the basis of clinical interest and prior findings.\n\nResultsThere were 5683 deaths attributed to COVID-19. In summary after full adjustment, death from COVID-19 was strongly associated with: being male (hazard ratio 1.99, 95%CI 1.88-2.10); older age and deprivation (both with a strong gradient); uncontrolled diabetes (HR 2.36 95% CI 2.18-2.56); severe asthma (HR 1.25 CI 1.08-1.44); and various other prior medical conditions. Compared to people with ethnicity recorded as white, black people were at higher risk of death, with only partial attenuation in hazard ratios from the fully adjusted model (age-sex adjusted HR 2.17 95% CI 1.84-2.57; fully adjusted HR 1.71 95% CI 1.44-2.02); with similar findings for Asian people (age-sex adjusted HR 1.95 95% CI 1.73-2.18; fully adjusted HR 1.62 95% CI 1.431.82).\n\nConclusionsWe have quantified a range of clinical risk factors for death from COVID-19, some of which were not previously well characterised, in the largest cohort study conducted by any country to date. People from Asian and black groups are at markedly increased risk of in-hospital death from COVID-19, and contrary to some prior speculation this is only partially attributable to pre-existing clinical risk factors or deprivation; further research into the drivers of this association is therefore urgently required. Deprivation is also a major risk factor with, again, little of the excess risk explained by co-morbidity or other risk factors. The findings for clinical risk factors are concordant with policies in the UK for protecting those at highest risk. Our OpenSAFELY platform is rapidly adding further NHS patients records; we will update and extend these results regularly.",

The cut-off probability values for low, medium, and high-risk groups were 0.072 and 0.244.\n\nMeaningThe findings of this study suggest that our models performs well for the diagnosis and prediction of progression to severe or critical illness of COVID-19 patients and could be used for triage of COVID-19 patients at hospital admission.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has globally strained medical resources and caused significant mortality for severely and critically ill patients. However, the availability of validated nomograms and the machine-learning model to predict severity risk and triage of affected patients is limited.\n\nOBJECTIVETo develop and validate nomograms and machine-learning models for severity risk assessment and triage for COVID-19 patients at hospital admission.\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTSA retrospective cohort of 299 consecutively hospitalized COVID-19 patients at The Central Hospital of Wuhan, China, from December 23, 2019, to February 13, 2020, was used to train and validate the models. Six cohorts with 426 patients from eight centers in China, Italy, and Belgium, from February 20, 2020, to March 21, 2020, were used to prospectively validate the models.\n\nMAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURESThe main outcome was the onset of severe or critical illness during hospitalization. Model performances were quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.\n\nRESULTSOf the 299 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the retrospective cohort, the median age was 50 years ((interquartile range, 35.5-63.0; range, 20-94 years) and 137 (45.8%) were men. Of the 426 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the prospective cohorts, the median age was 62.0 years ((interquartile range, 50.0-72.0; range, 19-94 years) and 236 (55.4%) were men. The model was prospectively validated on six cohorts yielding AUCs ranging from 0.816 to 0.976, with accuracies ranging from 70.8% to 93.8%, sensitivities ranging from 83.7% to 100%, and specificities ranging from 41.0% to 95.7%. The cut-off values of the low, medium, and high-risk probabilities were 0.072 and 0.244. The developed online calculators can be found at https://covid19risk.ai/.\n\nCONCLUSION AND RELEVANCEThe machine learning models, nomograms, and online calculators might be useful for the prediction of onset of severe and critical illness among COVID-19 patients and triage at hospital admission.

    "abstract": "We report a longitudinal analysis of the immune response associated with a fatal case of COVID-19. This patient exhibited a rapid evolution towards multiorgan failure. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in multiple nasopharyngeal, blood, and pleural samples, despite antiviral and immunomodulator treatment. Clinical evolution in the blood was marked by an increase (2-3 fold) in differentiated effector T cells expressing exhaustion (PD-1) and senescence (CD57) markers, an expansion of antibody-secreting cells, a 15-fold increase in {gamma}{delta} T-cell and proliferating NK-cell populations, and the total disappearance of monocytes, suggesting lung trafficking. In the serum, waves of a proinflammatory cytokine storm, Th1 and Th2 activation, and markers of T-cell exhaustion, apoptosis, cell cytotoxicity, and endothelial activation were observed until the fatal outcome. This case underscores the need for well-designed studies to investigate complementary approaches to control viral replication, the source of the hyperinflammatory status, and immunomodulation to target the pathophysiological response.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionHumans and viruses have co-evolved for millennia resulting in a complex host genetic architecture. Understanding the genetic mechanisms of immune response to viral infection provides insight into disease etiology and informs public health interventions.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a comprehensive study linking germline genetic variation and gene expression with antibody response to 28 antigens for 16 viruses using serological data from 7924 participants in the UK Biobank cohort. Using test results from 2010 UK Biobank subjects, we also investigated genetic determinants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\n\nResultsSignals in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region dominated the landscape of viral antibody response, with 40 independent loci and 14 independent classical alleles, 7 of which exhibited pleiotropic effects across viral families. Genome-wide association analyses discovered 7 novel genetic loci associated with viral antibody response (P<5.0x10-8), including FUT2 (19q13.33) for human polyomavirus BK (BKV), STING1 (5q31.2) for Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV), as well as CXCR5 (11q23.3) and TBKBP1 (17q21.32) for human herpesvirus 7. Transcriptome-wide association analyses identified 114 genes associated with response to viral infection, 12 outside of the HLA region, including ECSCR: P=5.0x10-15 (MCV), NTN5: P=1.1x10-9 (BKV), and P2RY13: P=1.1x10-8 (Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen). We also demonstrated pleiotropy between viral response genes and complex diseases, such as C4A expression in varicella zoster virus and schizophrenia. Finally, our analyses of SARS-CoV-2 revealed the first genome-wide significant infection susceptibility signal in EHF, an epithelial-specific transcriptional repressor implicated in airway disease. Targeted analyses of expression quantitative trait loci suggest a possible role for tissue-specific ACE2 expression in modifying SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility.\n\nConclusionsOur study confirms the importance of the HLA region in host response to viral infection and elucidates novel genetic determinants of host-virus interaction. Our results may have implications for complex disease etiology and COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Coronaviruses are prone to emergence into new host species most recently evidenced by SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Small animal models that recapitulate SARS-CoV-2 disease are desperately needed to rapidly evaluate medical countermeasures (MCMs). SARS-CoV-2 cannot infect wildtype laboratory mice due to inefficient interactions between the viral spike (S) protein and the murine ortholog of the human receptor, ACE2. We used reverse genetics to remodel the S and mACE2 binding interface resulting in a recombinant virus (SARS-CoV-2 MA) that could utilize mACE2 for entry. SARS-CoV-2 MA replicated in both the upper and lower airways of both young adult and aged BALB/c mice. Importantly, disease was more severe in aged mice, and showed more clinically relevant phenotypes than those seen in hACE2 transgenic mice. We then demonstrated the utility of this model through vaccine challenge studies in immune competent mice with native expression of mACE2. Lastly, we show that clinical candidate interferon (IFN) lambda-1a can potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human airway epithelial cells in vitro, and both prophylactic and therapeutic administration diminished replication in mice. Our mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 model demonstrates age-related disease pathogenesis and supports the clinical use of IFN lambda-1a treatment in human COVID-19 infections.",

    "abstract": "Viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2, which is the virus responsible of the Covid-19 pandemic, were sequenced in several Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) seized in the Guangdong and Guangxi provinces of China between 2017 and 20191-3. These viruses belong to two lineages: one from Guangdong (GD/P) and the other from Guangxi (GX/P). The GD/P viruses are particularly intriguing as the amino-acid sequence of the receptor binding domain of the spike protein is very similar to that of the human SARS-CoV-2 virus (97.4%)2. This characteristic suggests that GD/P viruses are capable of binding human ACE2 receptor and may therefore be able to mediate infection of human cells. Whereas all six GX/P genomes were deposited as annotated sequences in GenBank, none of the two GD/P genomes assembled in previous studies2,3 are currently available. To overcome this absence, I assembled these genomes from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data available for SARS-CoV-2-like viruses detected in five captive pangolins from Guangdong. I found the genome assemblies of GD/P virus of poor quality, having high levels of missing data. Additionally, unexpected reads in the Illumina sequencing data were identified. The GD/P2S dataset2 contains reads that are identical to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting either the coexistence of two SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the same pangolin or contamination by the human virus. In the four other GD/P datasets1 many mitochondrial reads from pangolin were identified, as well as from three other species, namely, human, mouse and tiger. Importantly, I only identified three polymorphic nucleotide sites between the five GD/P sequences. Such low levels of polymorphism may reasonably be accounted for by sequencing errors alone, thus raising the possibility that the five pangolins seized in Guangdong in March 2019 were infected by the same virus strain, most probably during their captivity.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that originated from Wuhan, China, in December 2019 has impacted public health, society and economy and the daily lives of billions of people in an unprecedented manner. There are currently no specific registered antiviral drugs to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections. Therefore, drug repurposing would be the fastest route to provide at least a temporary solution while better, more specific drugs are being developed. Here we demonstrate that the antiparasitic drug suramin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, protecting Vero E6 cells with an EC50 of [~]20 {micro}M, which is well below the maximum attainable level in human serum. Suramin also decreased the viral load by 2-3 logs when Vero E6 cells or cells of a human lung epithelial cell line (Calu-3) were treated. Time of addition and plaque reduction assays showed that suramin acts on early steps of the replication cycle, possibly preventing entry of the virus. In a primary human airway epithelial cell culture model, suramin also inhibited the progression of infection. The results of our preclinical study warrant further investigation and suggest it is worth evaluating whether suramin provides any benefit for COVID-19 patients, which obviously requires well-designed, properly controlled randomized clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "The recently ermerging disease COVID-19 is caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus first detected in the city of Wuhan, China. From there it has been rapidly spreading inside and outside China. With initial death rates around 4%, COVID-19 patients at longer distances from Wuhan showed reduced mortality as was previously observed for the SARS coronavirus. However, the new coronavirus spreads more strongly, as it sheds long before onset of symptoms or may be transmitted by people without symptoms. Rapid development of a protective vaccine against COVID-19 is therefore of paramount importance. Here we demonstrate that recombinantly expressed receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein homologous to SARS binds to ACE2, the viral receptor. Higly repetitive display of RBD on immunologically optimized virus-like particles derived from cucumber mosaic virus resulted in a vaccine candidate (RBD-CuMVTT) that induced high levels of specific antibodies in mice which were able to block binding of spike protein to ACE2 and potently neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 can lead to acute respiratory syndrome, which can be due to dysregulated immune signaling. We analyze the distribution of CpG dinucleotides, a pathogen-associated molecular pattern, in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We find that the CpG content, which we characterize by a force parameter that accounts for statistical constraints acting on the genome at the nucleotidic and amino-acid levels, is, on average, low compared to other pathogenic betacoronaviruses. However, the CpG force widely fluctuates along the genome, with a particularly low value, comparable to the circulating seasonal HKU1, in the spike coding region and a greater value, comparable to SARS and MERS, in the highly expressed nucleocapside coding region (N ORF), whose transcripts are relatively abundant in the cytoplasm of infected cells and present in the 3UTRs of all subgenomic RNA. This dual nature of CpG content could confer to SARS-CoV-2 the ability to avoid triggering pattern recognition receptors upon entry, while eliciting a stronger response during replication. We then investigate the evolution of synonymous mutations since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, finding a signature of CpG loss in regions with a greater CpG force. Sequence motifs preceding the CpG-loss-associated loci in the N ORF match recently identified binding patterns of the Zinc finger Anti-viral Protein. Using a model of the viral gene evolution under human host pressure, we find that synonymous mutations seem driven in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and particularly in the N ORF, by the viral codon bias, the transition-transversion bias and the pressure to lower CpG content.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEpidemiological, virological and pathogenetic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection are under evaluation. A better understanding of the pathophysiology associated with COVID-19 is crucial to improve treatment modalities and to develop effective prevention strategies. Transcriptomic and proteomic data on the host response against SARS-CoV-2 still have anecdotic character; currently available data from other coronavirus infections are therefore a key source of information.\n\nMethodsWe investigated selected molecular aspects of three human coronavirus (HCoV) infections, namely SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, through a network based-approach. A functional analysis of HCoV-host interactome was carried out in order to provide a theoretic host-pathogen interaction model for HCoV infections and in order to translate the results in prediction for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.\n\nThe 3D model of S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was compared to the structure of the corresponding SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV S-glycoprotein. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E and the host interactome were inferred through published protein-protein interactions (PPI) as well as gene co-expression, triggered by HCoV S-glycoprotein in host cells.\n\nResultsAlthough the amino acid sequences of the S-glycoprotein were found to be different between the various HCoV, the structures showed high similarity, but the best 3D structural overlap shared by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, consistent with the shared ACE2 predicted receptor. The host interactome, linked to the S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, mainly highlighted innate immunity pathway components, such as Toll Like receptors, cytokines and chemokines.\n\nConclusionsIn this paper, we developed a network-based model with the aim to define molecular aspects of pathogenic phenotypes in HCoV infections. The resulting pattern may facilitate the process of structure-guided pharmaceutical and diagnostic research with the prospect to identify potential new biological targets.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the ongoing Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic 1,2. In order to understand SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity and antigenic potential, and to develop diagnostic and therapeutic tools, it is essential to portray the full repertoire of its expressed proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 coding capacity map is currently based on computational predictions and relies on homology to other coronaviruses. Since coronaviruses differ in their protein array, especially in the variety of accessory proteins, it is crucial to characterize the specific collection of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in an unbiased and open-ended manner. Utilizing a suite of ribosome profiling techniques 3-8, we present a high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 coding regions, allowing us to accurately quantify the expression of canonical viral open reading frames (ORF)s and to identify 23 novel unannotated viral translated ORFs. These ORFs include upstream ORFs (uORFs) that are likely playing a regulatory role, several in-frame internal ORFs lying within existing ORFs, resulting in N-terminally truncated products, as well as internal out-of-frame ORFs, which generate novel polypeptides. We further show that viral mRNAs are not translated more efficiently than host mRNAs; rather, virus translation dominates host translation due to high levels of viral transcripts. Overall, our work reveals the full coding capacity of SARS-CoV-2 genome, providing a rich resource, which will form the basis of future functional studies and diagnostic efforts.",

    "abstract": "The technique RT-qPCR for viral RNA detection is the current worldwide strategy used for early detection of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. RNA extraction is a key pre-analytical step in RT-qPCR, often achieved using commercial kits. However, the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic is causing disruptions to the global supply chains used by many diagnostic laboratories to procure the commercial kits required for RNA extraction. Shortage in these essential reagents is even more acute in developing countries with no means to produce kits locally. We sought to find an alternative procedure to replace commercial kits using common reagents found in molecular biology laboratories. Here we report a method for RNA extraction that takes about 40 min to complete ten samples, and is not more laborious than current commercial RNA extraction kits. We demonstrate that this method can be used to process nasopharyngeal swab samples and yields RT-qPCR results comparable to those obtained with commercial kits. Most importantly, this procedure can be easily implemented in any molecular diagnostic laboratory. Frequent testing is crucial for individual patient management as well as for public health decision making in this pandemic. Implementation of this method could maintain crucial testing going despite commercial kit shortages.",

To get a grip on this outbreak, specific preventive and therapeutic interventions are urgently needed. It must be said that, until now, there are no existing vaccines for coronaviruses. To promptly and rapidly respond to pandemic events, the application of in silico trials can be used for designing and testing medicines against SARS-CoV-2 and speed-up the vaccine discovery pipeline, predicting any therapeutic failure and minimizing undesired effects. Here, we present an in silico platform that showed to be in very good agreement with the latest literature in predicting SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and related immune system host response. Moreover, it has been used to predict the outcome of one of the latest suggested approach to design an effective vaccine, based on monoclonal antibody. Universal Immune System Simulator (UISS) in silico platform is potentially ready to be used as an in silico trial platform to predict the outcome of vaccination strategy against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has tragically burdened individuals and institutions around the world. There are currently no approved drugs or vaccines for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Enhanced understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis is critical for the development of therapeutics. To reveal insight into viral replication, cell tropism, and host-viral interactions of SARS-CoV-2 we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of experimentally infected human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) in air-liquid interface cultures over a time-course. This revealed novel polyadenylated viral transcripts and highlighted ciliated cells as a major target of infection, which we confirmed by electron microscopy. Over the course of infection, cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2 expands to other epithelial cell types including basal and club cells. Infection induces cell-intrinsic expression of type I and type III IFNs and IL6 but not IL1. This results in expression of interferon-stimulated genes in both infected and bystander cells. We observe similar gene expression changes from a COVID-19 patient ex vivo. In addition, we developed a new computational method termed CONditional DENSity Embedding (CONDENSE) to characterize and compare temporal gene dynamics in response to infection, which revealed genes relating to endothelin, angiogenesis, interferon, and inflammation-causing signaling pathways. In this study, we conducted an in-depth analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HBECs and a COVID-19 patient and revealed genes, cell types, and cell state changes associated with infection.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe mortality impact of COVID-19 has thus far been described in terms of crude death counts. We aimed to calibrate the scale of the modelled mortality impact of COVID-19 using age-standardised mortality rates and life expectancy contribution against other, socially-determined, causes of death in order to inform governments and the public.\n\nMethodsWe compared mortality attributable to suicide, drug poisoning and socioeconomic inequality with estimates of mortality from an infectious disease model of COVID-19. We calculated age-standardised mortality rates and life expectancy contributions for the UK and its constituent nations.\n\nResultsMortality from a fully unmitigated COVID-19 pandemic is estimated to be responsible for a negative life expectancy contribution of -5.96 years for the UK. This is reduced to -0.33 years in the fully mitigated scenario. The equivalent annual life expectancy contributions of suicide, drug poisoning and socioeconomic inequality-related deaths are -0.25, -0.20 and -3.51 years respectively. The negative impact of fully unmitigated COVID-19 on life expectancy is therefore equivalent to 24 years of suicide deaths, 30 years of drug poisoning deaths, and 1.7 years of inequality-related deaths for the UK.\n\nConclusionFully mitigating COVID-19 is estimated to prevent a loss of 5.63 years of life expectancy for the UK. Over 10 years there is a greater negative life expectancy contribution from inequality than around six unmitigated COVID-19 pandemics. To achieve long-term population health improvements it is therefore important to take this opportunity to introduce post-pandemic economic policies to  build back better.\n\nSummary boxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this subject?C_ST_ABSCOVID-19 has been modelled to create a substantial excess mortality in the UK, depending on the degree to which this is mitigated by social distancing measures. Best estimates of 510,000 and 20,000 crude deaths are predicted in unmitigated and fully mitigated scenarios respectively.\n\nWhat does this study add?We scale the mortality impact of the modelled COVID-19 on age-standardised mortality and life expectancy against suicide, drug poisonings and inequalities. The impact of COVID-19 on life expectancy is substantial (-5.96 years) if unmitigated, but over a decade the life expectancy impact of inequalities is around six times greater than even an unmitigated pandemic.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRecent epidemiological evidence has demonstrated a higher rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths among minorities. This pattern of race-ethnic disparities emerging throughout the United States raises the question of what social factors may influence spread of a highly transmissible novel coronavirus. The purpose of this study is to describe race-ethnic and socioeconomic disparities associated with COVID-19 in patients in our community in Orange County, California and understand the role of individual-level factors, neighborhood-level factors, and access to care on outcomes.\n\nMethodsThis is a case-series of COVID-19 patients from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) across six-weeks between 3/12/2020 and 4/22/2020. Note, Californias shelter-in-place order began on 3/19/2020. Individual-level factors included race-ethnicity status were recorded. Neighborhood-level factors from census tracts included median household income, mean household size, proportion without a college degree, proportion working from home, and proportion without health insurance were also recorded.\n\nResultsA total of 210-patients tested were COVID-19 positive, of which 73.3% (154/210) resided in Orange County. Hispanic/Latinx patients residing in census tracts below the median income demonstrated exponential growth (rate = 55.9%, R2 = 0.9742) during the study period. In addition, there was a significant difference for both race-ethnic (p < 0.001) and income bracket (p = 0.001) distributions prior to and after Californias shelter-in-place. In addition, the percentage of individuals residing in neighborhoods with denser households (p = 0.046), lower levels of college graduation (p < 0.001), health insurance coverage (p = 0.01), and ability to work from home (p < 0.001) significantly increased over the same timeframe.\n\nConclusions and RelevanceOur study examines the race-ethnic disparities in Orange County, CA, and highlights vulnerable populations that are at increased risk for contracting COVID-19. Our descriptive case series illustrates that we also need to consider socioeconomic factors, which ultimately set the stage for biological and social disparities.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe novel human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has claimed more than 240,000 lives worldwide, causing tremendous public health, social, and economic damages. While the risk factors of COVID-19 are still under investigation, environmental factors, such as urban air pollution, may play an important role in increasing population susceptibility to COVID-19 pathogenesis.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional nationwide study using zero-inflated negative binomial models to estimate the association between long-term (2010-2016) county-level exposures to NO2, PM2.5 and O3 and county-level COVID-19 case-fatality and mortality rates in the US. We used both single and multipollutant models and controlled for spatial trends and a comprehensive set of potential confounders, including state-level test positive rate, county-level healthcare capacity, phase-of-epidemic, population mobility, sociodemographic, socioeconomic status, behavior risk factors, and meteorological factors.\n\nResults1,027,799 COVID-19 cases and 58,489 deaths were reported in 3,122 US counties from January 22, 2020 to April 29, 2020, with an overall observed case-fatality rate of 5.8%. Spatial variations were observed for both COVID-19 death outcomes and long-term ambient air pollutant levels. County-level average NO2 concentrations were positively associated with both COVID-19 case-fatality rate and mortality rate in single-, bi-, and tri-pollutant models (p-values<0.05). Per inter-quartile range (IQR) increase in NO2 (4.6 ppb), COVID-19 case-fatality rate and mortality rate were associated with an increase of 7.1% (95% CI 1.2% to 13.4%) and 11.2% (95% CI 3.4% to 19.5%), respectively. We did not observe significant associations between long-term exposures to PM2.5 or O3 and COVID-19 death outcomes (p-values>0.05), although per IQR increase in PM2.5 (3.4 ug/m3) was marginally associated with 10.8% (95% CI: -1.1% to 24.1%) increase in COVID-19 mortality rate.\n\nDiscussions and ConclusionsLong-term exposure to NO2, which largely arises from urban combustion sources such as traffic, may enhance susceptibility to severe COVID-19 outcomes, independent of longterm PM2.5 and O3 exposure. The results support targeted public health actions to protect residents from COVID-19 in heavily polluted regions with historically high NO2 levels. Moreover, continuation of current efforts to lower traffic emissions and ambient air pollution levels may be an important component of reducing population-level risk of COVID-19 deaths.",

    "abstract": "In March and April 2020, control measures enforcing social distancing and restricting individual movement and contact were adopted across the United States in an effort to slow the spread and growth of COVID-19. However, a number of states have now begun to ease these restrictions. Here, we evaluate the effects of loosening stay-at-home orders on COVID-19 incidence and related outcomes. We use a metapopulation model applied at county resolution to simulate the spread and growth of COVID-19 incidence in the United States. We calibrate the model against county-level daily case and death data collected from February 21, 2020 to May 2, 2020, and project the outbreak in 3,142 US counties for 6 weeks into the future. Projections for daily reported cases, daily new infections (both reported and unreported), new and cumulative hospital bed demand, ICU bed and ventilator demand, as well as daily mortality, are generated. We observe a rebound in COVID-19 incidence and deaths beginning in late May, approximately 2 to 4 weeks after states begin to reopen. Importantly, the lag between infection acquisition and case confirmation, coupled with insufficient broader testing and contact tracing, will mask any rebound and exponential growth of the COVID-19 until it is well underway.",

    "abstract": "The global pandemic due to the emergence of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a threat to the future health of humanity. There remains an urgent need to understand its transmission characteristics and design effective interventions to mitigate its spread. In this study, we define a non-linear (known in biochemistry models as allosteric or cooperative) relationship between viral shedding, viral dose and COVID-19 infection propagation. We develop a mathematical model of the dynamics of COVID-19 to link quantitative features of viral shedding, human exposure and transmission in nine countries impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The model was then used to evaluate the efficacy of interventions against virus transmission. We found that cooperativity was important to capture country-specific transmission dynamics and leads to resistance to mitigating transmission in mild or moderate interventions. The behaviors of the model emphasize that strict interventions greatly limiting both virus shedding and human exposure are indispensable to achieving effective containment of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19 in children remains low to date. In just a few months, COVID-19 has affected millions of people worldwide, and as of the date of this publication, the pandemic continues. Based on the current available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 than adults. However, children with neurological and neuromuscular conditions are vulnerable to the respiratory complications of other viral infections.\n\nObjectivesTo assess whether children with brain-based developmental disabilities were more likely to develop COVID-19 and have complications or poorer outcomes following infection.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a two-week rapid review on studies with primary data regarding children aged between zero and 18 years old with brain-based developmental disabilities, or who were at risk of developing such disabilities, with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. We performed our literature searches on April 18, 2020.\n\nResultsOur search strategy identified 538 individual records, of which four were included in our review. Of the 50 COVID-19 pediatric patients reported in the included studies, a total of seven children were at risk of developing brain-based disabilities. Symptoms ranged in severity. However, generally, patients were discharged or saw improvements in their symptoms by the end of the study period. No deaths were reported.\n\nDiscussionOur study highlights a knowledge gap regarding the impact of COVID-19 in children with brain-based developmental disabilities.",

Being able to analyse and predict the spread of this epidemic-causing disease is hence of utmost importance now, especially as it would help in the reasoning behind important decisions drastically affecting countries and their people, as well as in ensuring efficient resource and utility management. However, the needs of the people and specific conditions of the spread are varying widely from country to country.

    "abstract": "The extent and duration of immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection are critical outstanding questions about the epidemiology of this novel virus, and studies are needed to evaluate the effects of serostatus on reinfection. Understanding the potential sources of bias and methods to alleviate biases in these studies is important for informing their design and analysis. Confounding by individual-level risk factors in observational studies like these is relatively well appreciated. Here, we show how geographic structure and the underlying, natural dynamics of epidemics can also induce noncausal associations. We take the approach of simulating serologic studies in the context of an uncontrolled or a controlled epidemic, under different assumptions about whether prior infection does or does not protect an individual against subsequent infection, and using various designs and analytic approaches to analyze the simulated data. We find that in studies assessing the efficacy of serostatus on future infection, comparing seropositive individuals to seronegative individuals with similar time-dependent patterns of exposure to infection, by stratifying or matching on geographic location and time of enrollment, is essential to prevent bias.",

Discrepant results were adjudicated by medical record review. 200 nasopharyngeal swab specimens in viral transport medium (VTM) were collected from symptomatic patients between March 27 and April 9, 2020. Results were concordant for 167 specimens (83.5% overall agreement), including 94 positive and 73 negative specimens. The RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay on the m2000 yielded 33 additional positive results, 25 of which were also positive by the modified CDC assay but not by the ID NOW COVID-19 assay. In a follow-up evaluation, 97 patients for whom a dry nasal swab specimen yielded negative results by the ID NOW COVID-19 assay had a paired nasopharyngeal swab specimen collected in VTM and tested by the RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay; SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 13 (13.4%) of these specimens. Medical record review deemed all discrepant results to be true positives. The ID NOW COVID-19 test was the easiest to perform and provided a result in the shortest time: as soon as 5 minutes for positive and 13 minutes for negative result. The RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay on the m2000 detected more cases of COVID-19 infection than the modified CDC assay or the ID NOW COVID-19 test.",

Models based on these acquired data may suffer from systematic errors and large estimation variances due to the biases associated with testing and lags between the infection and death counts. Here, we present an augmented compartment model to predict epidemic dynamics while explicitly modeling for the sampling bias involved in testing. Our simulations show that sampling biases in favor of patients with higher disease manifestation could significantly affect direct estimates of infection and fatality rates calculated from the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths, and serological testing can partially mitigate these biased estimates. We further recommend a strategy to obtain unbiased estimates, calculating the dependence of expected confidence on a randomized sample size, showing that relatively small sample sizes can provide statistically significant estimates for SARS-CoV-2 related death rates.",

    "abstract": "Public health officials need to make urgent decisions to reduce the potential impact of the CoVID-19 pandemic. Benchmarking based on the increase in total cases or case fatality rates is one way of comparing performance across countries or territories (such as states in the USA), and could inform policy decisions about COVID-19 mitigation strategies. But comparing cases and fatality across territories is challenging due to heterogeneity in testing and health systems. We show two complementary ways of benchmarking across countries or US states. First, we used multivariate regressions to estimate the test-elasticity-of-COVID-19-case-incidence. We found a 10% increase in testing yielded ~9% (95% CI:4.2-3.4%; p<0.001) increase in reported cases across countries, and ~2% (95%CI:0.1-3.4%; p=0.03) increase across US states during the week ending April 10th, 2020. We found comparable negative elasticities for fatality rates (across countries: {beta} =-0.77, 95%CI:-1.40- -0.14; p=0.02; US states: {beta}=-0.15, 95%CI:-0.30-0.01; p=0.06). Our results were robust to various model specifications. Second, we decomposed the growth in cases into test growth and positive test ratio (PTR) growth to intuitively visualize the components of case growth. We hope these results can help support evidence-based decisions by public health officials as more consistent data hopefully becomes available.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption across cancer pathways for diagnosis and treatment. In England, 32% of colorectal cancer (CRC) is diagnosed via urgent symptomatic referral from primary care, the \"2-week-wait\" (2WW) pathway. Access to routine endoscopy is likely to be a critical bottleneck causing delays in CRC management due to chronic limitation in capacity, acute competition for physician time, and safety concerns.\n\nMethodsWe used age-specific, stage-specific 10 year CRC survival for England 2007-2017 and 2WW CRC cases volumes. We used per-day hazard ratios of CRC survival generated from observational studies of CRC diagnosis-to-treatment interval to model the effect of different durations of per-patient delay. We utilised data from a large London observational study of faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) in symptomatic patients to model FIT-triage to mitigate delay to colonoscopy.\n\nFindingsModest delays result in significant reduction in survival from CRC with a 4-month delay resulting across age groups in [&ge;]20% reduction in survival in Stage 3 disease and in total over a year, 1,419 attributable deaths across the 11,266 CRC patients diagnosed via the 2WW pathway. FIT triage of >10 ug Hb/g would salvage 1,292/1,419 of the attributable deaths and reduce colonoscopy requirements by >80%. Diagnostic colonoscopy offers net survival in all age groups, providing nosocomial COVID-19 infection rates are kept low (<2{middle dot}5%).\n\nInterpretationTo avoid significant numbers of avoidable deaths from CRC, normal diagnostic and surgical throughput must be maintained. An accrued backlog of cases will present to primary care following release of lockdown, supranormal endoscopy capacity will be required to manage this without undue delays. FIT-triage of symptomatic cases provides a rational approach by which to avoid patient delay and mitigate pressure on capacity in endoscopy. This would also reduce exposure to nosocomial COVID-19 infection, relevant in particular to older patient groups.\n\nFundingBreast Cancer Now, Cancer Research UK, Bobby Moore Fund for Cancer Research, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR).",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWith the global outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic since early 2020, there has been considerable attention on CT-based diagnosis as an effective and reliable method. Recently, the advent of deep learning in medical diagnosis has been well proven. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can be used to detect the COVID-19 infection imaging features in a chest CT scan. We introduce ai-corona, a radiologist-assistant deep learning framework for COVID-19 infection diagnosis using the chest CT scans.\n\nMethodOur dataset comprises 2121 cases of axial spiral chest CT scans in three classes; COVID-19 abnormal, non COVID-19 abnormal, and normal, from which 1764 cases were used for training and 357 cases for validation. The training set was annotated using the reports of two experienced radiologists. The COVID-19 abnormal class validation set was annotated using the general consensus of a collective of criteria that indicate COVID-19 infection. Moreover, the validation sets for the non COVID-19 abnormal and the normal classes were annotated by a different experienced radiologist. ai-corona constitutes a CNN-based feature extractor conjoined with an average pooling and a fully-connected layer to classify a given chest CT scan into the three aforementioned classes.\n\nResultsWe compare the diagnosis performance of ai-corona, radiologists, and model-assisted radiologists for six combinations of distinguishing between the three mentioned classes, including COVID-19 abnormal vs. others, COVID-19 abnormal vs. normal, COVID-19 abnormal vs. non COVID-19 abnormal, non COVID-19 abnormal vs. others, normal vs. others, and normal vs. abnormal. ai-corona achieves an AUC score of 0.989 (95% CI: 0.984, 0.994), 0.997 (95% CI: 0.995, 0.999), 0.986 (95% CI: 0.981, 0.991), 0.959 (95% CI: 0.944, 0.974), 0.978 (95% CI: 0.968, 0.988), and 0.961 (95% CI: 0.951, 0.971) in each combination, respectively. By employing Bayesian statistics to calculate the accuracies at a 95% confidence interval, ai-corona surpasses the radiologists in distinguishing between the COVID-19 abnormal class and the other two classes (especially the non COVID-19 abnormal class). Our results show that radiologists diagnosis performance improves when incorporating ai-coronas prediction. In addition, we also show that RT-PCRs diagnosis has a much lower sensitivity compared to all the other methods.\n\nConclusionai-corona is a radiologist-assistant deep learning framework for fast and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis in chest CT scans. Our results ascertain that our framework, as a reliable detection tool, also improves experts diagnosis performance and helps especially in diagnosing non-typical COVID-19 cases or non COVID-19 abnormal cases that manifest COVID-19 imaging features in chest CT scan.

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is related in the most recent pandemic situation, significantly affecting health and economic systems. In this study we assessed the death rate associated to COVID-19 in Brazil and the United States of America (USA) to estimate the probability of Brazil becoming the next pandemic epicenter. We equated data between Brazil and USA obtained through the Worldometer website (www.worldometer.info). Epidemic curves from Brazil and USA were associated and regression analysis was undertaken to predict the Brazilian death rate regarding COVID-19 in June. In view of data from April 9th 2020, death rates in Brazil follow a similar exponential increase to USA (r=0.999; p<0.001), estimating 64,310 deaths by June 9th 2020. In brief, our results demonstrated that Brazil follows an analogous progression of COVID-19 deaths cases when compared to USA, signifying that Brazil could be the next global epicenter of COVID-19. We highlight public strategies to decrease the COVID-19 outbreak.",

    "abstract": "An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 has now been confirmed globally. In absence of effective vaccines, infection prevention and control through diagnostic testing and quarantine is critical. Early detection and differential diagnosis of respiratory infections increases the chances for successful control of COVID-19 disease. The nucleic acid RT-PCR test is regarded as the current standard for molecular diagnosis with high sensitivity. However, the highest specificity confirmation target ORF1ab gene is considered to be less sensitive than other targets in clinical application. In addition, a large amount of recent evidence indicates that the initial missed diagnosis of asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 and discharged patients with \"re-examination positive\" may be due to low viral load, and the ability of rapid mutation of coronavirus also increases the rate of false negative results. We aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of different nucleic acid detection kits so as to make recommendations for the selection of validation kit, and amplify the suspicious result to be reportable positive by means of simple continuous amplification, which is of great significance for the prevention and control of the current epidemic and the discharge criteria of low viral load patients.",

    "abstract": "Following detection of the first few COVID-19 cases in early March, Bangladesh has stepped up its efforts to strengthen capacity of the healthcare system to avert a crisis in the event of a surge in the number of cases. This paper sheds light on the preparedness of the healthcare system by examining the spatial distribution of isolation beds across districts and divisions, forecasting the number of ICU units that may be required in the short term and analyzing the availability of frontline healthcare workers to combat the pandemic. As of May 2, COVID-19 cases have been found in 61 of the 64 districts in Bangladesh with Dhaka District being the epicenter. Seventy-one percent of the cases have been identified in 6 neighboring districts, namely, Dhaka, Narayanganj, Gazipur, Narsingdi, Munsiganj and Kishoreganj, which appear to form a spatial cluster. However, if one takes into account the population at risk, the prevalence appears to be highest in Dhaka, followed by Narayanganj, Gazipur, Kishorganj, Narsingdi and Munshiganj. These regions may therefore be flagged as the COVID-19 hotspots in Bangladesh. Among the eight divisions, prevalence is highest in Dhaka Division followed by Mymensingh. The number of cases per million exceeds the number of available isolation beds per million in the major hotspots indicating that there is a risk of the healthcare system becoming overwhelmed should the number of cases rise. This is especially true for Dhaka Division, where the ratio of COVID-19 patients to doctors appears to be alarmingly high. My-mensingh Division also has a disproportionately small number of doctors relative to the number of COVID-19 patients. Using second order polynomial regression, the analysis predicts that even if all ICU beds are allocated to COVID-19 patients, Bangladesh may run out of ICU beds soon after May 15, 2020. We conclude that in spite of a significant increase in hospital capacity during 2005-15 and a 57 % rise in the number of doctors during the same period, the healthcare system in Bangladesh and Dhaka Division in particular, may not be fully prepared to handle the COVID-19 crisis. Thus, further steps need to be taken to flatten the curve and improve healthcare capacity.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe case fatality rate from COVID-19 differs markedly around the world. There are likely a number of factors one can attribute to such disparity, not least of which is differing healthcare models and approaches. Here, we examine the COVID-19 related health advice issued by six different countries, specifically examining the patient-led triage pathways in each country.\n\nMethodsA simulation study was conducted on current, nationwide, patient-led triage systems from three countries with low case fatality rates (Singapore, Norway and Japan) and two countries with high case fatality rates (the USA and the UK). Cases were simulated by clinicians to approximate typical COVID-19 presentations (mild, severe and critical), and COVID-19 mimickers (sepsis, bacterial pneumonia). The same simulations were applied to each of the five countrys patient-led triage systems, and the recommendations to refer on for medical care or to advise to stay at home were recorded and compared. Statistical analysis examined the potential correlation between triage outcomes and case fatality rates.\n\nResultsPatient-led triage systems from Singapore, Japan and Norway maintained a low threshold for advising clinical contact for patients with possible COVID-19 (88 to 100% of cases were referred). Patient-led triage systems from the USA and the UK maintained high thresholds for advising healthcare contact (28 and 33% of cases were referred, respectively). There was a strong inverse correlation between percentage of cases referred and the nations case fatality rate (Pearsons Correlation = -0.642, p = 0.01).\n\nConclusionIn this simulation study, the triage algorithms of Singapore, Norway and Japan successfully identified severe COVID-19 and triaged such cases to medical care. The USA triage system and the UKs triage system performed poorly, failing to identify severe COVID-19 infection and sepsis. The performance of national COVID-19 triage systems correlate with case fatality rates, in this cohort of countries.",

    "abstract": "The capacity of current molecular testing convention does not allow high-throughput and community level scans of COVID-19 infections. The diameter in current paradigm of shallow tracing is unlikely to reach the silent clusters that might be as important as the symptomatic cases in the spread of the disease. Group testing is a feasible and promising approach when the resources are scarce and when a relatively low prevalence regime is observed on the population. We employed group testing with a sparse random pooling scheme and conventional group test decoding algorithms both for exact and inexact recovery. Our simulations showed that significant reduction in per case test numbers (or expansion in total test numbers preserving the number of actual tests conducted) for very sparse prevalence regimes is available. Currently proposed COVID-19 group testing schemes offer a gain up to 10X scale-up. There is a good probability that the required scale up to achieve massive scale testing might be greater in certain scenarios. We investigated if further improvement is available, especially in sparse prevalence occurrence where outbreaks are needed to be avoided by population scans. Our simulations show that sparse random pooling can provide improved efficiency gains compared to row-column group testing or Reed-Solomon error correcting codes. Therefore, we propose that special designs for different scenarios could be available and it is possible to scale up testing capabilities significantly.",

    "abstract": "Novel corona virus is declared as pandemic and India is struggling to control this from a massive attack of death and destruction, similar to the other countries like China, Europe, and the United States of America. India reported 2545 cases novel corona confirmed cases as of April 2, 2020 and out of which 191 cases were reported recovered and 72 deaths occurred. The first case of novel corona is reported in India on January 30, 2020. The growth in the initial phase is following exponential. In this study an attempt has been made to model the spread of novel corona infection. For this purpose logistic growth model with minor modification is used and the model is applied on truncated information on novel corona confirmed cases in India. The result is very exiting that till date predicted number of confirmed corona positive cases is very close to observed on. The time of point of inflexion is found in the end of the April, 2020 means after that the increasing growth will start decline and there will be no new case in India by the end of July, 2020.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 most likely evolved from a bat beta-coronavirus and started infecting humans in December 2019. Since then it has rapidly infected people around the world, with more than 4.5 million confirmed cases by the middle of May 2020. Early genome sequencing of the virus has enabled the development of molecular diagnostics and the commencement of therapy and vaccine development. The analysis of the early sequences showed relatively few evolutionary selection pressures. However, with the rapid worldwide expansion into diverse human populations, significant genetic variations are becoming increasingly likely. The current limitations on social movement between countries also offers the opportunity for these viral variants to become distinct strains with potential implications for diagnostics, therapies and vaccines.\n\nMethodsWe used the current sequencing archives (NCBI and GISAID) to investigate 15,487 whole genomes, looking for evidence of strain diversification and selective pressure.\n\nResultsWe used 6,294 SNPs to build a phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 diversity and noted strong evidence for the existence of two major clades and six sub-clades, unevenly distributed across the world. We also noted that convergent evolution has potentially occurred across several locations in the genome, showing selection pressures, including on the spike glycoprotein where we noted a potentially critical mutation that could affect its binding to the ACE2 receptor. We also report on mutations that could prevent current molecular diagnostics from detecting some of the sub-clades.\n\nConclusionThe worldwide whole genome sequencing effort is revealing the challenge of developing SARS-CoV-2 containment tools suitable for everyone and the need for data to be continually evaluated to ensure accuracy in outbreak estimations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSARS-CoV-2, a positive-sense RNA virus in the family Coronaviridae, has caused a worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 Coronaviruses generate a tiered series of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) through a process involving homology between transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS) located after the leader sequence in the 5 UTR (the TRS-L) and TRS located near the start of structural and accessory proteins (TRS-B) near the 3 end of the genome. In addition to the canonical sgRNAs generated by SARS-CoV-2, non-canonical sgRNAs (nc-sgRNAs) have been reported. However, the consistency of these nc-sgRNAs across viral isolates and infection conditions is unknown. The comprehensive definition of SARS-CoV-2 RNA products is a key step in understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.\n\nMethodsHere, we report an integrative analysis of eight independent SARS-CoV-2 transcriptomes generated using three sequencing strategies, five host systems, and seven viral isolates. Read-mapping to the SARS-CoV-2 genome was used to determine the 5 and 3 coordinates of all identified junctions in viral RNAs identified in these samples.\n\nResultsUsing junctional abundances, we show nc-sgRNAs make up as much as 33% of total sgRNAs in vitro, are largely consistent in abundance across independent transcriptomes, and increase in abundance over time during in vitro infection. By assessing the homology between sequences flanking the 5 and 3 junction points, we show that nc-sgRNAs are not associated with TRS-like homology. By incorporating read coverage information, we find strong evidence for subgenomic RNAs that contain only 5 regions of ORF1a. Finally, we show that non-canonical junctions change the landscape of viral open reading frames.\n\nConclusionsWe identify canonical and non-canonical junctions in SARS-CoV-2 sgRNAs and show that these RNA products are consistently generated across many independent viral isolates and sequencing approaches. These analyses highlight the diverse transcriptional activity of SARS-CoV-2 and offer important insights into SARS-CoV-2 biology.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundReporting of daily hospital COVID-19 deaths in the UK are promoted by the government and scientific advisers alike as a key metric for assessing the progress in the control of the epidemic. These data, however, have certain limitations, among which one of the most significant concerns the fact that the daily totals span deaths that have occurred between 1 and 10 days or more in the past.\n\nData and methodsWe obtained daily data published published by NHS England up to and including April 25 in the form of Excel spreadsheets in which deaths counts are presented by date of death according to age and region. Simple descriptive analyses were conducted and presented in graphical and tabular form which were aimed at illustrating the biases inherent in focussing on daily counts regardless of when the deaths occurred. We then looked at how a less biased picture could be obtained by looking at trends in death counts stratifying by individual period of delay in days between occurrence of death and when the death was included in the daily announcement.\n\nFindingsThe number of hospital COVID-19 deaths announced daily overestimates the maximum number of deaths actually occurring so far in the epidemic in the UK, and also obscures the pattern of decline in deaths. Taking account of reporting delays suggests that for England as a whole a peak in hospital COVID-19 deaths may have been reached on April 8 with a subsequent gradual decline suggested. The same peak is also seen among those aged 60-79 and 80+, although there is slightly shallower decline in the oldest age group (80+ years). Among those aged 40-59 years a later peak on April 11 is evident. London shows a peak on April 8 and a clearer and steeper pattern of subsequent decline compared to England as a whole.\n\nInterpretationAnalyses of mortality trends must take account of delay, and in communication with the public more emphasis should be placed on looking at trends based on deaths that occurred 5 or more days prior to the announcement day. The slightly weaker decline seen at age 80+ may reflect increased hospitalisation of people from care homes, whereas the later peak under the age of 60 years may reflect the higher proportions at these younger ages being admitted to critical care resulting in an extension of life of several days.\n\nCompeting interestsAll authors have completed the ICMJE uniform disclosure form at www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf and declare: no support from any organization for the submitted work; no financial relationships with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work in the previous three years other than LS who reported grants from Wellcome, MRC, NIHR, GSK, BHF, Diabetes UK all outside the submitted work; no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work other than LS who is a Trustee of the British Heart Foundation and AJM who is a member of the Royal Society Delve Committee.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe risk of severe COVID-19 disease is known to be higher in older individuals and those with underlying health conditions. Understanding the number of individuals at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness, and how this varies between countries may inform the design of possible strategies to shield those at highest risk.\n\nMethodsWe estimated the number of individuals at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease by age (5-year age groups), sex and country (n=188) based on prevalence data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study for 2017 and United Nations population estimates for 2020. We also calculated the number of individuals without an underlying condition that could be considered at-risk because of their age, using thresholds from 50-70 years. The list of underlying conditions relevant to COVID-19 disease was determined by mapping conditions listed in GBD to the guidelines published by WHO and public health agencies in the UK and US. We analysed data from two large multimorbidity studies to determine appropriate adjustment factors for clustering and multimorbidity.\n\nResultsWe estimate that 1.7 (1.0 - 2.4) billion individuals (22% [15-28%] of the global population) are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease. The share of the population at increased risk ranges from 16% in Africa to 31% in Europe. Chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and chronic respiratory disease (CRD) were the most prevalent conditions in males and females aged 50+ years. African countries with a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS and Island countries with a high prevalence of diabetes, also had a high share of the population at increased risk. The prevalence of multimorbidity (>1 underlying conditions) was three times higher in Europe than in Africa (10% vs 3%).\n\nConclusionBased on current guidelines and prevalence data from GBD, we estimate that one in five individuals worldwide has a condition that is on the list of those at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease. However, for many of these individuals the underlying condition will be undiagnosed or not severe enough to be captured in health systems, and in some cases the increase in risk may be quite modest. There is an urgent need for robust analyses of the risks associated with different underlying conditions so that countries can identify the highest risk groups and develop targeted shielding policies to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSAs the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, countries are considering policies of  shielding the most vulnerable, but there is currently very limited evidence on the number of individuals that might need to be shielded. Guidelines on who is currently believed to be at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness have been published online by the WHO and public health agencies in the UK and US. We searched PubMed (\"Risk factors\" AND \"COVID-19\") without language restrictions, from database inception until April 5, 2020, and identified 62 studies published between Feb 15, 2020 and March 20, 2020. Evidence from China, Italy and the USA indicates that older individuals, males and those with underlying conditions, such as CVD, diabetes and CRD, are at greater risk of severe COVID-19 illness and death.\n\nAdded value of this studyThis study combines evidence from large international databases and new analysis of large multimorbidity studies to inform policymakers about the number of individuals that may be at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness in different countries. We developed a tool for rapid assessments of the number and percentage of country populations that would need to be targeted under different shielding policies.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceQuantifying how many and who is at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness is critical to help countries design more effective interventions to protect vulnerable individuals and reduce pressure on health systems. This information can also inform a broader assessment of the health, social and economic implications of shielding various groups.",

    "abstract": "As the number of people affected by COVID-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 ebbs and flows in different national and sub-national regions across the world, it is evident that our lifestyle and socio-economic trajectories will have to be adapted and adjusted to the changing scenarios. Novel forecasting tools and frameworks provide an arguable advantage to facilitate this adapting and adjusting process, by promoting efficient resource management at individual and institutional levels. Based on deterministic compartment models we propose an empirical top-down modeling approach to provide epidemic forecasts and risk calculations for (local) outbreaks. We use neural networks to develop leading indicators based on available data for different regions. These indicators are not only used to assess the risk of a (new) outbreak or to determine the effectiveness of a measure at an early stage, but also in parametric models to determine an effective forecast, along with the associated uncertainty. Based on initial results, we show the performance of such an approach and its robustness against inherent disturbances in epidemiological surveillance data. We foresee such a statistical framework to drive web-based automatic platforms to democratize the dissemination of prognosis results.",

Original studies reporting the clinical outcomes of adult survivors of coronavirus outbreaks two months after discharge or three months after admission were included. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) 2009 Level of Evidence Tool. Meta-analysis was conducted to derive pooled estimates of prevalence and severity for different outcomes at time points up to 6 months follow-up and beyond 6 months follow-up.\n\nResultsThe search yielded 1169 studies of which 28 were included in this review. There were 15 Level 1b, 8 Level 2b, 2 Level 3b and 3 Level 4 studies by OCEBM grading. Pooled analysis of studies revealed that complications commonly observed were impaired diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) [prevalence of 27.26%, 95% CI 14.87 to 44.57] and reduced exercise capacity [(6-minute walking distance (6MWD) mean 461m, 95% CI 449.66 to 472.71] at 6 months with limited improvement beyond 6 months. Coronavirus survivors had considerable prevalence of psychological disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [38.80%, CI 30.93 to 47.31], depression [33.20%, CI 19.80 to 50.02] and anxiety [30.04%, CI 10.44 to 61.26) beyond 6 months. These complications were accompanied by low Short Form 36 (SF-36) scores at 6 months and beyond indicating reduced quality of life which is present long-term.\n\nConclusionsThe long term clinical problems in survivors of CoV infections (SARS and MERS) after hospitalisation or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission include respiratory dysfunction, reduced exercise capacity, psychological problems such as PTSD, depression and anxiety, and reduced quality of life. Critical care, rehabilitation and mental health services should anticipate a high prevalence of these problems following COVID-19 and ensure their adequate and timely management with the aim of restoring premorbid quality of life.",

To do so we employ a modular design approach and broadly explore taking advantage of parts from non-traditional supply chains. In our current prototype, we demonstrate volume control with assist control on a test lung and present a linear actuator-driven pinch valve-based implementation for both pressure control and volume control with decelerating inspiratory flow. We estimate the component cost of the system to be around $500. We publish our draft design documents and current implementation which is open and accessible in the hope that broadening the community globally will accelerate arriving at a solution and that peer review will improve the final design.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the contribution of population age structure to mortality from Covid-19 in the UK by geographical units. We project death rates at various spatial scales by applying data on age-specific fatality rates to the areas population by age and sex. Our analysis shows a significant variation in the projected death rates between the constituent countries of the UK, between its regions and within regions. First, Scotland and Wales have higher projected fatality levels from Covid-19 than England, whereas Northern Ireland has lower rate. Second, the infection fatality rates are projected to be substantially higher in small towns and rural areas than those in large urban areas. Third, our analysis shows that within urban regions there are also  pockets of high projected death rates. Overall, the areas with high and low fatality rates tend to cluster because of the high residential separation of different population age-groups in the UK. Our analysis also reveals that the Welsh-, Gaelic- and Cornish-speaking communities with relatively old populations are likely to experience heavy population losses if the virus spreads widely across the UK.",

    "abstract": "Testing is viewed as a critical aspect of any strategy to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. Much of the dialogue around testing has concentrated on how countries can scale up capacity, but the uncertainty in testing has not received nearly as much attention beyond asking if a test is accurate enough to be used. Even for highly accurate tests, false positives and false negatives will accumulate as mass testing strategies are employed under pressure, and these misdiagnoses could have major implications on the ability of governments to suppress the virus. The present analysis uses a modified SIR model to understand the implication and magnitude of misdiagnosis in the context of ending lock-down measures. The results indicate that increased testing capacity alone will not provide a solution to lock-down measures in the UK. The progression of the epidemic and peak infections is shown to depend heavily on test characteristics, test targeting, and prevalence of the infection. Antibody based immunity passports are rejected as a solution to ending lockdown, as they can put the population at risk if poorly targeted. Similarly, mass screening for active viral infection may only be beneficial if it can be sufficiently well targeted, otherwise reliance on this approach for protection of the population can again put them at risk. A well targeted active viral test combined with a slow release rate is a viable strategy for continuous suppression of the virus.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCoronavirus (COVID-19) poses health system challenges in every country. As with any public health emergency, a major component of the global response is timely, effective science. However, particular factors specific to COVID-19 must be overcome to ensure that research efforts are optimised. We aimed to model the impact of COVID-19 on the clinical academic response in the UK, and to provide recommendations for COVID-related research.\n\nMethodsWe constructed a simple stochastic model to determine clinical academic capacity in the UK in four policy approaches to COVID-19 with differing population infection rates: \"Italy model\" (6%), \"mitigation\" (10%), \"relaxed mitigation\" (40%) and \"do-nothing\" (80%) scenarios. The ability to conduct research in the COVID-19 climate is affected by the following key factors: (i) infection growth rate and population infection rate (from UK COVID-19 statistics and WHO); (ii) strain on the healthcare system (from published model); and (iii) availability of clinical academic staff with appropriate skillsets affected by frontline clinical activity and sickness (from UK statistics).\n\nFindingsIn \"Italy model\", \"mitigation\", \"relaxed mitigation\" and \"do-nothing\" scenarios, from 5 March 2020 the duration (days) and peak infection rates (%) are 95(2.4%), 115(2.5%), 240(5.3%) and 240(16.7%) respectively. Near complete attrition of academia (87% reduction, <400 clinical academics) occurs 35 days after pandemic start for 11, 34, 62, 76 days respectively - with no clinical academics at all for 37 days in the \"do-nothing\" scenario. Restoration of normal academic workforce (80% of normal capacity) takes 11,12, 30 and 26 weeks respectively.\n\nInterpretationPandemic COVID-19 crushes the science needed at system level. National policies mitigate, but the academic community needs to adapt. We highlight six key strategies: radical prioritisation (eg 3-4 research ideas per institution), deep resourcing, non-standard leadership (repurposing of key non-frontline teams), rationalisation (profoundly simple approaches), careful site selection (eg protected sites with large academic backup) and complete suspension of academic competition with collaborative approaches.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic poses two challenges to healthcare providers. Firstly, a high number of patients require hospital admission. Second, a high number of healthcare staff are either falling ill with the infection, or self-isolating. This poses significant problems for the staffing of busy hospital departments. We have created a simple model which allows users to stress test their rota. The model provides plots of staff availability over time using either a constant infection rate, or a changing infection rate fitted to population-based infection curves. It allows users to gauge the extent and timing of dips in staff availability. The basic constant infection rate model is available within an on-line web application (https://covid19.shef.ac.uk). As for any model, our work is imperfect. However, it allows a range of infection rates to be simulated quickly across different work patterns. We hope it will be useful to those planning staff deployment and will stimulate debate on the most effective patterns of work during the COVID-19 epidemic.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe first COVID-19 case in Kenya was confirmed on March 13th, 2020. Here, we provide forecasts for the potential incidence rate, and magnitude, of a COVID-19 epidemic in Kenya based on the observed growth rate and age distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases observed in China, whilst accounting for the demographic and geographic dissimilarities between China and Kenya.\n\nMethodsWe developed a modelling framework to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Kenya, KenyaCoV. KenyaCoV was used to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission both within, and between, different Kenyan regions and age groups. KenyaCoV was parameterized using a combination of human mobility data between the defined regions, the recent 2019 Kenyan census, and estimates of age group social interaction rates specific to Kenya. Key epidemiological characteristics such as the basic reproductive number and the age-specific rate of developing COVID-19 symptoms after infection with SARS-CoV-2, were adapted for the Kenyan setting from a combination of published estimates and analysis of the age distribution of cases observed in the Chinese outbreak.\n\nResultsWe find that if person-to-person transmission becomes established within Kenya, identifying the role of subclinical, and therefore largely undetected, infected individuals is critical to predicting and containing a very significant epidemic. Depending on the transmission scenario our reproductive number estimates for Kenya range from 1.78 (95% CI 1.44 -2.14) to 3.46 (95% CI 2.81-4.17). In scenarios where asymptomatic infected individuals are transmitting significantly, we expect a rapidly growing epidemic which cannot be contained only by case isolation. In these scenarios, there is potential for a very high percentage of the population becoming infected (median estimates: >80% over six months), and a significant epidemic of symptomatic COVID-19 cases. Exceptional social distancing measures can slow transmission, flattening the epidemic curve, but the risk of epidemic rebound after lifting restrictions is predicted to be high.",

Standardized morbidity ratios (SMR) were used to impute missing cases and adjust CFR. Age-specific attack rates and CFR were applied to different countries with differing age structures (Italy, Japan, Indonesia, and Egypt), in order to generate estimates for CFR, apparent epidemic size, and time to outbreak recognition for identical age-specific attack rates.\n\nResultsSMR demonstrated that 50-70% of cases were likely missed during the Chinese epidemic. Adjustment for under-recognition of younger cases decreased CFR from 2.4% to 0.8% (assuming 50% case ascertainment in older individuals). Standardizing the Chinese epidemic to countries with older populations (Italy, and Japan) resulted in larger apparent epidemic sizes, higher CFR and earlier outbreak recognition. The opposite effect was demonstrated for countries with younger populations (Indonesia, and Egypt).\n\nLimitationsSecondary data analysis based on a single country at an early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, with no attempt to incorporate second order effects (ICU saturation) on CFR.\n\nConclusionDirect and indirect standardization are simple tools that provide key insights into between-country variation in the apparent size and severity of COVID-19 epidemics.\n\nFundingThe research was supported by a grant to DNF from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (2019 COVID-19 rapid researching funding OV4-170360).",

Variants that proxy ACE inhibitor drug effects and cardiometabolic risk factors (body mass index, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lifetime smoking index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and type 2 diabetes mellitus) were selected from publicly available genome-wide association study data (sample sizes ranging from 188,577 to 898,130 participants). Genetic association estimates for lung expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were obtained from the Gene-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project (515 participants) and the Lung eQTL Consortium (1,038 participants).

    "abstract": "Recently, a wide array of epidemiological models have been developed to guide public health actors in containing the rapid dissemination of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), cause of COVID-19. Despite their usefulness, many epidemiological models recently developed to understand the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and infection rates of COVID-19 fall short as they ignore human mobility, limiting our understanding of the spread of the disease, together with the vulnerability of population centers in a broad scale. We developed a new temporally-explicit model and simulated several social distancing scenarios to predict the vulnerability to COVID-19 of 50 Mexican cities that are interconnected by their air transportation network. Additionally, we assessed the sufficiency of the public health infrastructure in the focal cities to face the pandemic over time. Based on our model, we show that the most important cities within the Mexican air transportation network are the most vulnerable to COVID-19, with all assessed public health infrastructure being insufficient to face the modeled scenario for the pandemic after 100 days. Despite these alarming findings, our results show that social distancing could dramatically decrease the total number of infected people (77% drop-off for the 45% distancing scenario when contrasted with no distancing), flattening the growth of infection rate. Thus, we consider that this study provides useful information that may help decision-makers to timely implement health policies to anticipate and lessen the impact of the current pandemic in Mexico.\n\nSignificance StatementWe used a new temporally-explicit model focused on air transportation networks to predict the vulnerability of 50 focal Mexican cities to COVID-19. We found that most vulnerable cities lack of the required public health infrastructure (i.e., number of inpatient and intensive care unit beds) to face this new pandemic, overloading in all cases after 100 days. However, our results show that a 45% social distancing scenario can reduce the number of infected people by up to 78.7%, flattening the growth rate of people with COVID-19 before infection rates soar exponentially countrywide.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the present study is to reveal the acceptance and preference for the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination in health-care workers (HCWs). We performed an internet-based, region-stratified survey among 352 HCWs and 189 individuals in the general population enrolled on March 17th and 18th 2020 from 26 Chinese provinces. The HCWs developed a more in-depth understanding of SARS-Coronavirus-2 infection and showed a higher tolerance to the future vaccination than the general population. 76.4% of HCWs (vs. 72.5% in the general) showed their willingness to receive vaccination. Potential benefits from COVID-19 outbreak such as seeking influenza (65.3%) or pneumonia (55.7%) vaccination can be gained in HCWs. To estimate the relative effects of attributes influencing vaccination choice in the discrete choice experiment, 7 attributes (3 disease-relevant, 3 vaccine-relevant, and 1 of social acceptance) were identified as key determinants. Among them, disease trend (odds ratio, OR: 4.367 (95%CI, 3.721-5.126) for seasonal epidemic, OR: 3.069 (2.612-3.605) for persistent epidemic, with reference to disappearance in summer), social contacts decisions (0.398: 0.339-0.467 for refusal, 0.414: 0.353-0.487 for neutral, with reference to acceptance) and high possibility of being infected (2.076: 1.776-2.425 for infection probability of 30%+) were significantly associated with increased probability of choosing vaccination in the HCWs. In contrast, for the general population, vaccine safety and social contacts decisions were the most important predictors. For COVID-19 vaccination, education in HCWs should be taken as a priority, and further benefits of its recommendation to the general public will also be anticipated.",

The general goal of this work is present a new model of SARS-CoV-2 to predict different scenarios of accumulated cases in Spain.\n\nMaterial and methodsIn this short report is used a model proposed previously, based on a parametric model Weibull and in a the library BDSbiost3 developed in R to infer and predict different scenarios of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 for the accumulated cases in Spain after the spread that affects Spain detected at the end of January of this year.\n\nResultsIn the analyses presented, projective curves have been generated for the evolution of accumulated cases in which they reach about 4,000 cases or about 15,000 cases, for which the lines of the day in which the value for 90 will be reached can be seen vertically 90, 95 and 99% of the asymptote (maximum number of cases, from that day they will begin to descend or remain the same), that is why the vertical lines would indicate the brake of the disease. For the worst-case scenario, it takes 118, 126 or 142 days to reach the maximum number of cases (n = 15,000) to reach 90, 95 and 99% of the asymptote (maximum number of cases), respectively. This means translated in a time scale that in the worst case the virus will not stop its progress, in Spain, until summer 2020, hopefully before.\n\nComments and conclusionsThis model could be used to plan the resources and see if the policies or means dedicated to the virus are slowing the progress of the virus or it is necessary to implement others that are more effective, and can also validate a method for future outbreaks of diseases such as these.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is challenging many societal institutions, including our criminal justice systems. Some have proposed or enacted (e.g. the State of New Jersey) reductions in the jail and/or prison populations. We present a mathematical model to explore the epidemiological impact of such interventions in jails and contrast them with the consequences of maintaining unaltered practices. We consider infection risk and likely in-custody deaths, and estimate how within jail dynamics lead to spill-over risks, not only affecting incarcerated people, but increasing exposure, infection, and death rates for both corrections officers, and the broader community beyond the justice system. We show that, given a typical jail-community dynamic, operating in a business-as-usual way will result in significant and rapid loss of life. Large scale reductions in arrest and speeding of releases are likely to save the lives of incarcerated people, jail staff, and the community at large.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic is placing unprecedented demands on healthcare systems worldwide and exacting a massive humanitarian toll. This makes the development of accurate predictive models imperative, not just for understanding the course of the pandemic but more importantly for gaining insight into the efficacy of public health measures and planning accordingly. Epidemiological models are forced to make assumptions about many unknowns and therefore can be unreliable. Here, taking an empirical approach, we report a 20-30 day lag between the peak of confirmed to recovered cases and the peak of daily deaths in each country, independent of the epoch of that country in its pandemic cycle. This analysis is expected to be largely independent of the proportion of the population being tested and therefore should aid in planning around the timing and easing of public health measures. Our data also suggests broad predictions for the number of fatalities, generally somewhat lower than most other models. Finally, our model suggests that the world as a whole is shortly to enter a recovery phase, at least as far as the first pandemic wave is concerned.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious infectious disease, which has caused great number of deaths and health problems worldwide. This study aims to examine the effects of airborne particulate matter (PM) pollution on COVID-19 across China.\n\nMethodsIn this study, we obtained confirmed cases of COVID-19, the data of airborne ambient PM with aerodynamic diameter [&le;] 2.5 m (PM2.5) and [&le;] 10 m (PM10), ambient temperature (AT), absolute humidity (AH) and migration scale index (MSI) in 72 cities of China (excluded Wuhan city) on a daily basis, each of which confirmed more than 50 cases from January 20th to March 2nd, 2020. We applied a two-stage analysis. Generalized additive models with quasi-Poisson distribution was first fitted to estimate city-specific effects of PM10 and PM2.5 on daily confirmed COVID-19 cases while controlling AT, AH and MSI. Then, we used meta-analysis to generate the pooled effect estimates from city-specific results.\n\nResultsDuring the study period, there were a total of 24 939 COVID-19 cases, most of which were reported in Hubei Province. In our meta-analysis, we found each 10 g/m3 increase in concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 in single day lag (from lag 0 to lag 7 and lag 14) were positively associated with confirmed cases of COVID-19, not including PM10 at lag 5, lag 6 and lag 7, and PM2.5 at lag 5, lag 6. Similar trend was also found in different cumulative lag days (from lag 01 to lag 07 and lag 014). The effects of PM2.5 and PM10 on daily COVID-19 confirmed cases are statistically significant for three cumulative lag periods over 3, 7 and 14 days with the greatest effect over 14 days. The estimated RRs of which were 1.64 (95% CIs: 1.47, 1.82) and 1.47 (95% CIs: 1.34, 1.61) with each 10 g/m3 increase in concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10, respectively. In addition, we found that the effects of PM2.5 on daily confirmed cases were greater than PM10 in all included lag days.\n\nConclusionsThis nationwide study suggests that airborne PM pollution likely increases the risk of getting COVID-19 in China.",

    "abstract": "Viral genetic variants are widely known to influence disease progression among infected humans. Given the recent and rapid emergence of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cause of COVID-19 disease, viral protein variants have attracted research interest. However, little has yet been written about genetic risk factors among human hosts. Human genetic variation has proven to affect disease progression and outcome for important diseases such as HIV infection and malaria infestation. The fact that the human ACE2 protein is encoded on the X chromosome means that males who carry rare ACE2 coding variants will express those variants in all ACE2-expressing cells, whereas females will typically express those variants in a mosaic distribution determined by early X-inactivation events. This sex-based difference in ACE2 expression has unique implications for epidemiological studies designed to assess host genetic factors influencing progression from asymptomatic SARS-coV-2 infection to COVID-19. Here we present theoretical modelling of rare ACE2 coding variants documented to occur naturally in several human superpopulations and subpopulations, and show that rare variants predicted to affect the binding of ACE2 to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein exist in people. Though the rs4646116 (p.Lys26Arg) allele is found in 1 in 70 Ashkenazi Jewish males, and in 1 in 172 non-Finnish European males, this allele is found at higher frequencies in females. Furthermore, the class of missense ACE2 alleles predicted to affect SARS-CoV-2 binding are found in aggregate among 1.43% and 2.16% of Ashkenazi males and females, respectively, as well as in 0.58% and 1.24% of European males and females outside of Finland. These alleles are rarer in other population groups, and almost absent from East Asians genotyped to date.\n\nThough we are aware that full genome-wide and exome-wide sequencing studies may ultimately be required to assess human genetic susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 fully, we argue on the basis of strong prior probabilities that genotyping of this class of alleles is justified in cases of atypical SARS-CoV-2 diseases, such as asymptomatic super-spreaders (if any are identified), and in neonatal/paediatric-onset COVID-19 disease. Even relatively rare susceptibility factors (1% or fewer carriers) may become quantitatively important in the context of hundreds of thousands of infections. A small number of asymptomatic carriers, or a small number of super-spreaders, or a small segment of the population that is disproportionately likely to require intensive care, can magnify the medical, social and economic impacts of a pandemic of this size. The speed of the pandemic and the large number of affected cases worldwide justify efforts to identify all possible risk factors for adverse outcomes, including efforts to identify genetic susceptibility factors in human hosts.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, alternative methods of care are needed to reduce the relative risk of transmission in departments. Also needed is the ability to provide vital radiation oncological care if radiation oncologists (RO) are reallocated to other departments. We implemented a novel remote RO SBRT coverage practice, requiring it to be reliable, of high audio and visual quality, timely, and the same level of specialty care as our current in-person treatment coverage practice.\n\nMETHODSAll observed failure modes were recorded during implementation over the first 15 sequential fractions. The time from CBCT to treatment was calculated before and after implementation to determine timeliness of remote coverage. Image quality metrics were calculated between the imaging console screen and the ROs shared screen. Comfort levels with audio/visual communication as well as overall comfort in comparison to in-person RO coverage was evaluated using Likert scale surveys after treatment.\n\nRESULTSRemote RO SBRT coverage was successfully implemented in 14/15 fractions with 3 observed process failures that were all corrected before treatment. Average times of pre-treatment coverage before and after implementation were 8.74 and 8.51min, respectively. The cross correlation between the imaging console screen and ROs shared screen was r=0.96 and lag was 0.05s. The average value for all survey questions was above 4.5, approaching in-person RO coverage comfort levels.\n\nCONCLUSIONSOur novel method of remote RO SBRT coverage permits reduced personnel and patient interactions surrounding RT procedures. This may help to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in our department and provides a means for SBRT coverage if ROs are reallocated to other areas of the hospital for COVID-19 support.",

    "abstract": "AimsThe SARS-Cov2 virus binds to the ACE2 receptor for cell entry. It has been suggested that ACE-inhibitors (ACEi) and Angiotensin-2 Blockers (ARB), which are commonly used in patients with hypertension or diabetes and may raise ACE2 levels, could increase the risk of severe COVID19 infection.\n\nMethods and ResultsWe evaluated this hypothesis in a consecutive cohort of 1200 acute inpatients with COVID19 at two hospitals with a multi-ethnic catchment population in London (UK). The mean age was 68{+/-}17 years (57% male) and 74% of patients had at least 1 comorbidity. 415 patients (34.6%) reached the primary endpoint of death or transfer to a critical care unit for organ support within 21-days of symptom onset. 399 patients (33.3 %) were taking ACEi or ARB. Patients on ACEi/ARB were significantly older and had more comorbidities. The odds ratio (OR) for the primary endpoint in patients on ACEi and ARB, after adjustment for age, sex and co-morbidities, was 0.63 (CI 0.47-0.84, p<0.01).\n\nConclusionsThere was no evidence for increased severity of COVID19 disease in hospitalised patients on chronic treatment with ACEi or ARB. A trend towards a beneficial effect of ACEi/ARB requires further evaluation in larger meta-analyses and randomised clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Cytokine storms are drivers of pathology and mortality in myriad viral infections affecting the human population. In SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, the strength of the cytokine storm has been associated with increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial damage, and death. However, the therapeutic value of attenuating the cytokine storm in COVID-19 remains to be defined. Here, we report results obtained using a novel mouse model of lethal sterile anti-viral immune responses. Using a mouse model of Down syndrome (DS) with a segmental duplication of a genomic region encoding four of the six interferon receptor genes (Ifnrs), we demonstrate that these animals overexpress Ifnrs and are hypersensitive to IFN stimulation. When challenged with viral mimetics that activate Toll-like receptor signaling and IFN anti-viral responses, these animals overproduce key cytokines, show exacerbated liver pathology, rapidly lose weight, and die. Importantly, the lethal immune hypersensitivity, accompanying cytokine storm, and liver hyperinflammation are blocked by treatment with a JAK1-specific inhibitor. Therefore, these results point to JAK1 inhibition as a potential strategy for attenuating the cytokine storm and consequent organ failure during overdrive immune responses. Additionally, these results indicate that people with DS, who carry an extra copy of the IFNR gene cluster encoded on chromosome 21, should be considered at high risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryInhibition of the JAK1 kinase prevents pathology and mortality caused by a rampant innate immune response in mice.",

    "abstract": "ImportanceA strategy for preventing further spread of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic is to detect infections and isolate infected individuals without the need of extensive bio-specimen testing.\n\nObjectivesHere we investigate the prevalence of loss of smell and taste among COVID-19 diagnosed individuals and we identify the combination of symptoms, besides loss of smell and taste, most likely to correspond to a positive COVID-19 diagnosis in non-severe cases.\n\nDesignCommunity survey.\n\nSetting and ParticipantsSubscribers of RADAR COVID-19, an app that was launched for use among the UK general population asking about COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nMain ExposureLoss of smell and taste.\n\nMain Outcome MeasuresCOVID-19.\n\nResultsBetween 24 and 29 March 2020, 1,573,103 individuals reported their symptoms via the app; 26% reported suffering from one or more symptoms of COVID-19. Of those, n=1702 reported having had a RT-PCR COVID-19 test and gave full report on symptoms including loss of smell and taste; 579 were positive and 1123 negative. In this subset, we find that loss of smell and taste were present in 59% of COVID-19 positive individuals compared to 18% of those negative to the test, yielding an odds ratio (OR) of COVID-19 diagnosis of OR[95%CI]=6.59[5.25; 8.27], P= 1.90x10-59. We also find that a combination of loss of smell and taste, fever, persistent cough, fatigue, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and loss of appetite is predictive of COVID-19 positive test with sensitivity 0.54[0.44; 0.63], specificity 0.86[0.80; 0.90], ROC-AUC 0.77[0.72; 0.82] in the test set, and cross-validation ROC-AUC 0.75[0.72; 0.77]. When applied to the 410,598 individuals reporting symptoms but not formally tested, our model predicted that 13.06%[12.97%;13.15] of these might have been already infected by the virus.\n\nConclusions and RelevanceOur study suggests that loss of taste and smell is a strong predictor of having been infected by the COVID-19 virus. Also, the combination of symptoms that could be used to identify and isolate individuals includes anosmia, fever, persistent cough, diarrhoea, fatigue, abdominal pain and loss of appetite. This is particularly relevant to healthcare and other key workers in constant contact with the public who have not yet been tested for COVID-19.\n\nKey pointsO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSO_LIThe spread of COVID-19 can be reduced by identifying and isolating infected individuals but it is not possible to test everyone and priority has been given in most countries to individuals presenting symptoms of the disease.\nC_LIO_LICOVID-19 symptoms, such as fever, cough, aches, fatigue are common in many other viral infections\nC_LIO_LIThere is therefore a need to identify symptom combinations that can rightly pinpoint to infected individuals\nC_LI\n\nWhat this study addsO_LIAmong individuals showing symptoms severe enough to be given a COVID-19 RT-PCR test in the UK the prevalence of loss of smell (anosmia) was 3-fold higher (59%) in those positive to the test than among those negative to the test (18%).\nC_LIO_LIWe developed a mathematical model combining symptoms to predict individuals likely to be COVID-19 positive and applied this to over 400,000 individuals in the general population presenting some of the COVID-19 symptoms.\nC_LIO_LIWe find that [~]13% of those presenting symptoms are likely to have or have had a COVID-19 infection. The proportion was slightly higher in women than in men but is comparable in all age groups, and corresponds to 3.4% of those who filled the app report.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "In the global effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, governments and public health agencies are striving to rapidly increase the volume and rate of diagnostic testing. The most common form of testing today employs Polymerase Chain Reaction in order to identify the presence of viral RNA in individual patient samples one by one. This process has become one of the most significant bottlenecks to increased testing, especially due to reported shortages in the chemical reagents needed in the PCR reaction.\n\nRecent technical advances have enabled High-Throughput PCR, in which multiple samples are pooled into one tube. Such methods can be highly efficient, saving large amounts of time and reagents. However, their efficiency is highly dependent on the frequency of positive samples, which varies significantly across regions and even within regions as testing criterion and conditions change.\n\nHere, we present two possible optimized pooling strategies for diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 testing on large scales, both addressing dynamic conditions. In the first, we employ a simple information-theoretic heuristic to derive a highly efficient re-pooling protocol: an estimate of the target frequency determines the initial pool size, and any subsequent pools found positive are re-pooled at half-size and tested again. In the range of very rare target (<0.05), this approach can reduce the number of necessary tests dramatically, for example, achieving a reduction by a factor of 50 for a target frequency of 0.001. The second method is a simpler approach of optimized one-time pooling followed by individual tests on positive pools. We show that this approach is just as efficient for moderate target-product frequencies (0.05<0.2), for example, achieving a two-fold in the number of when the frequency of positive samples is 0.07.\n\nThese strategies require little investment, and they offer a significant reduction in the amount of materials, equipment and time needed to test large numbers of samples. We show that both these pooling strategies are roughly comparable to the absolute upper-bound efficiency given by Shannons source coding theorem. We compare our strategies to the naive way of testing and to alternative matrix-pooling methods. Most importantly, we offer straightforward, practical pooling instructions for laboratories that perform large scale PCR assays to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 viral particles. These two pooling strategies may offer ways to alleviate the bottleneck currently preventing massive expansion of SARS-CoV-2 testing around the world.",

    "abstract": "1.Several studies have been published in the past few months describing the CT features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is a great degree of heterogeneity in the study designs, lesion descriptors used and conclusions derived. In our systematic analysis and meta-review, we have attempted to homogenize the reported features and provide a comprehensive view of the disease pattern and progression in different clinical stages. After an extensive literature search, we short-listed and reviewed 49 studies including over 4145 patients with 3615 RT-PCR positive cases of COVID-19 disease. We have found that there is a good agreement among these studies that diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) is the most common finding at all stages of the disease followed by consolidations and mixed density lesions. 78% of patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infections had either ground-glass opacities, consolidation or both. Inter-lobular septal thickening was also found to be a common feature in many patients in advanced stages. The progression of these initial patchy GGOs and consolidations to diffuse lesions with septal thickening, air bronchograms in the advanced stages, to either diffuse \"white-out\" lungs needing ICU admissions or finally resolving completely without or with residual fibrotic strips was also found to be congruent among multiple studies. Prominent juxta- lesional pulmonary vessels, pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy in RT-PCR proven cases were found to have poor clinical prognosis. Additionally, we noted wide variation in terminology used to describe lesions across studies and suggest the use of standardized lexicons to describe findings related to diseases of vital importance.",

Chest computed tomography (CT) has been found to support both, current diagnostic and disease monitoring. A joint approach to collect, analyze and share clinical and imaging information about COVID-19 in the highest quality possible is urgently needed.\n\nMethodsAn evidence-based reporting template was developed for assessing COVID-19 pneumonia using an FDA-approved medical software. The annotation of qualitative and quantitative findings including radiomics features is performed directly on primary imaging data. For data collection, secondary information from the patient history and clinical data such as symptoms and comorbidities are queried.\n\nResultsLicense-royalty free, cloud-based web platform and on-premise deployments are offered. Hospitals can upload, assess, report and if pseudonymized share their COVID-19 cases. The aggregation of radiomics in correlation with rt-PCR, patient history, clinical and radiological findings, systematically documented in a single database, will lead to optimized diagnosis, risk stratification and response evaluation. A customizable analytics dashboard allows the explorative real-time data analysis of imaging features and clinical information.\n\nConclusionsThe COVID-19-Template is based on a systematic, computer-assisted and context-guided approach to collect, analyze and share data.

    "abstract": "The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a major shortage of N95 respirators, which are essential to protecting healthcare professionals and the general public who may come into contact with the virus. Thus, it is essential to determine how we can reuse respirators and other personal protection in these urgent times. We investigated multiple commonly used and easily deployable, scalable disinfection schemes on media with particle filtration efficiency of 95%. Among these, heating ([&le;]85 {degrees}C) under various humidities ([&le;]100% RH) was the most promising, nondestructive method for the preservation of filtration properties in meltblown fabrics as well as N95-grade respirators. Heating can be applied up to 50 cycles (85 {degrees}C, 30% RH) without observation in the degradation of meltblown filtration performance. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation was a secondary choice which was able to withstand 10 cycles of treatment and showed small degradation by 20 cycles. However, UV can also potentially impact the material strength and fit of respirators. Finally, treatments involving liquids and vapors require caution, as steam, alcohol, and household bleach may all lead to degradation of the filtration efficiency, leaving the user vulnerable to the viral aerosols.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOn December 2019, Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was detected in Wuhan, China, and then spread around the world. There is little information about effects of COVID-19 on Pregnant women and newborns as a sensitive population. The current study is a systemic review and Meta-analysis to measure the risks and determine the presentations of COVID-19 in pregnant women and newborn.\n\nMethodsonline data bases were searched on march 20. Heterogeneity of the included studies was assessed using the Cochran Q test and Higgins I2 statistic and expressed as percentage. All data were analyzed with 95% confidence intervals.\n\nResultsA total of 7 studies involving 50 participants with Positive test of COVID-19 were enrolled. Mean age of pregnant women was 30.57 years old and the Mean Gestational age was 36.9 weeks. Other variables such as Apgar score, birth weight, Sign and symptoms, Complications and Laboratory data were Analyzed.\n\nConclusionOur findings showed same clinical characteristics in pregnant women as in non-pregnant adults, with the main symptoms being cough and fever. No vertical transmission was seen and all patients delivered healthy neonates. Our findings would be of great help to the decision making process, regarding the management of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Information is the most potent protective weapon we have to combat a pandemic, at both the individual and global level. For individuals, information can help us make personal decisions and provide a sense of security. For the global community, information can inform policy decisions and offer critical insights into the epidemic of COVID-19 disease. Fully leveraging the power of information, however, requires large amounts of data and access to it. To achieve this, we are making steps to form an international consortium, Coronavirus Census Collective (CCC, coronaviruscensuscollective.org), that will serve as a hub for integrating information from multiple data sources that can be utilized to understand, monitor, predict, and combat global pandemics. These sources may include self-reported health status through surveys (including mobile apps), results of diagnostic laboratory tests, and other static and real-time geospatial data. This collective effort to track and share information will be invaluable in predicting hotspots of disease outbreak, identifying which factors control the rate of spreading, informing immediate policy decisions, evaluating the effectiveness of measures taken by health organizations on pandemic control, and providing critical insight on the etiology of COVID-19. It will also help individuals stay informed on this rapidly evolving situation and contribute to other global efforts to slow the spread of disease.\n\nIn the past few weeks, several initiatives across the globe have surfaced to use daily self-reported symptoms as a means to track disease spread, predict outbreak locations, guide population measures and help in the allocation of healthcare resources. The aim of this paper is to put out a call to standardize these efforts and spark a collaborative effort to maximize the global gain while protecting participant privacy.",

    "abstract": "While mortality attributable to COVID-19 has devastated global health systems and economies, striking regional differences have been observed. The Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine has previously been shown to have non-specific protective effects on infections, as well as long-term efficacy against tuberculosis. Using publicly available data we built a simple log-linear regression model to assess the association of BCG use and COVID-19-attributable mortality per 1 million population after adjusting for confounders including country economic status (GDP per capita), and proportion of elderly among the population. The timing of country entry into the pandemic epidemiological trajectory was aligned by plotting time since the 100th reported case. Countries with economies classified as lower-middle-income, upper-middle-income and high-income countries (LMIC, UMIC, HIC) had median crude COVID-19 log-mortality of 0.4 (Interquartile Range (IQR) 0.1, 0.4), 0.7 (IQR 0.2, 2.2) and 5.5 (IQR 1.6, 13.9), respectively. COVID-19-attributable mortality among BCG-using countries was 5.8 times lower [95% CI 1.8-19.0] than in non BCG-using countries. Notwithstanding limitations due to testing constraints in LMICs, case ascertainment bias and a plausible rise of cases as countries progress along the epidemiological trajectory, these analyses provide intriguing observations that urgently warrant mobilization of resources for prospective randomized interventional studies and institution of systematic disease surveillance, particularly in LMICs.",

    "abstract": "The current pandemic of COVID-19 has lead to conflicting opinions on whether wearing facemasks outside of health care facilities protects against the infection. To better understand the value of wearing facemasks we undertook a rapid systematic review of existing scientific evidence about development of respiratory illness, linked to use of facemasks in community settings.\n\nMethodsWe included all study designs. There were 31 eligible studies (including 12 RCTs). Narrative synthesis and random-effects meta-analysis of attack rates for primary and secondary prevention in 28 studies were performed. Results were reported by design, setting and type of face barrier in primary prevention, and by who wore the facemask (index patient or well contacts) in secondary prevention trials. The preferred outcome was influenza-like illness (ILI) but similar outcomes were pooled with ILI when ILI was unavailable. GRADE quality assessment was based on RCTs with support from observational studies.\n\nResultsWhere specific information was available, most studies reported about use of medical grade (surgical paper masks). In 3 RCTs, wearing a facemask may very slightly reduce the odds of developing ILI/respiratory symptoms, by around 6% (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.19, I 29%, low-certainty evidence). Greater effectiveness was suggested by observational studies. When both house-mates and an infected household member wore facemasks the odds of further household members becoming ill may be modestly reduced by around 19% (OR 0.81, 95%CI 0.48 to 1.37, I 45%, 5 RCTs, low certainty evidence). The protective effect was very small if only the well person (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.28, I 11%, 2 RCTs, low uncertainty evidence) or the infected person wore the facemask (very low certainty evidence).\n\nDiscussionBased on the RCTs we would conclude that wearing facemasks can be very slightly protective against primary infection from casual community contact, and modestly protective against household infections when both infected and uninfected members wear facemasks. However, the RCTs often suffered from poor compliance and controls using facemasks. Across observational studies the evidence in favour of wearing facemasks was stronger. We expect RCTs to under-estimate the protective effect and observational studies to exaggerate it. The evidence is not sufficiently strong to support widespread use of facemasks as a protective measure against COVID-19. However, there is enough evidence to support the use of facemasks for short periods of time by particularly vulnerable individuals when in transient higher risk situations. Further high quality trials are needed to assess when wearing a facemask in the community is most likely to be protective.",

    "abstract": "Since Dec 2019, the COVID-19 epidemic has spread over the globe creating one of the greatest pandemics ever witnessed. This epidemic wave will only begin to roll back once a critical proportion of the population is immunised, either by mounting natural immunity following infection, or by vaccination. The latter option can minimise the cost in terms of human lives but it requires to wait until a safe and efficient vaccine is developed, a period estimated to last at least 18 months. In this work, we use optimal control theory to explore the best strategy to implement while waiting for the vaccine. We seek a solution minimizing deaths and costs due to the implementation of the control strategy itself. We find that such a solution leads to an increasing level of control with a maximum reached near the 16th month of the epidemics and a steady decrease until vaccine deployment. The average containment level is approximately 50% during the 25-months period for vaccine deployment. This strategy strongly out-performs others with constant or cycling allocations of the same amount of resources to control the outbreak. This work opens new perspectives to mitigate the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics, and be used as a proof-of-concept in using mathematical modelling techniques to enlighten decision making and public health management in the early times of an outbreak.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 (Corona Virus) is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-COV-2). The virus that was first discovered in China Wuhan Province about 3 months ago (first cases were reported in Wuhan on December 31st 2019) has spread world wide. The six (6) top countries (excluding China) most affected so far include; USA, Italy, Spain, Germany, France and Iran. With Italy showing the highest death toll.\n\nIn Uganda where it was discovered on 19/3/2020 with one (01) case has just in nine (9) days, increased to thirty (30) infected individuals. This model is a wake up call over the rate at which COVID-19 is likely to spread throughout the country. Thus it is a guide for policymakers and planners to benchmark on for solutions to this deadly virus.",

    "abstract": "At the end of March 2020, there were in excess of 800.000 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide. Several reports suggest that, in severe cases, COVID-19 may cause a hyperinflammatory \"cytokine storm\". However, unlike SARS-CoV infection, high levels of anti-inflammatory mediators have also been reported in COVID-19 patients. One study reported that 16% of COVID-19 patients who died developed secondary infection, which might indicate an immune-suppressed state. We explored kinetics of mHLA-DR expression, the most widely used marker of innate immune suppression in critically ill patients, in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU.\n\nTwenty-four confirmed COVID-19 patients were included, of which 75% was male and 79% had comorbidities. All patients were mechanically ventilated and exhibited large high levels of inflammatory parameters such as CRP and PCT. mHLA-DR expression levels were mostly within the normal range of 15000-45000 mAb/cell and showed no change over time. COVID-19 patients displayed notably higher mHLA-DR expression levels compared with bacterial septic shock patients. None of the COVID-19 patients developed a secondary infection.\n\nIn conclusion, despite a pronounced inflammatory response, mHLA-DR expression kinetics indicate no overt innate immune suppression in COVID-19 patients. These data signify that innate immune suppression as a negative feedback mechanism following PAMP-induced inflammation appears not to be present in COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo evaluate aerosol-spread in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) using different methods of airway management. Knowledge about aerosol-spread is vital during the SARS-CoV-2-Pandemic.\n\nMethodsTo evaluate feasibility we nebulized ultraviolet sensitive detergents into the artificial airway of a resuscitation dummy and performed CPR. The spread of the visualized aerosol was documented by a camera. In a second approach we applied nebulized detergents into human cadavers by an endotracheal tube and detected aerosol-spread during chest compressions the same way. We did recordings with undergoing compression-only-CPR, with a surgical mask and with an inserted laryngeal tube with and without a connected airway filter.\n\nResultsMost aerosol-spread at the direction of the provider was visualized during compression-only-CPR. The use of a surgical mask deflected the spread. Inserting a laryngeal tube connected to an airway filter lead to a remarkable reduction of aerosol-spread.\n\nConclusionThe early insertion of a laryngeal tube connected to an airway filter before starting chest compression may be good for two things - the treatment of hypoxemia as the likeliest cause of cardiac arrest and for staff protection during CPR.",

    "abstract": "Due to the recent diffusion of COVID-19 outbreak, the scientific community is making efforts in analysing models for understanding the present situation and predicting future scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Susceptible-Infected-Exposed-Recovered-Dead (SEIRD) differential model [Weitz J. S. and Dushoff J., Scientific reports, 2015] for the analysis and forecast of the COVID-19 spread in Italian regions, using the data from the Italian Protezione Civile from February 24th 2020. In this study, we investigate an adaptation of SEIRD that takes into account the actual policies of the Italian government, consisting of modelling the infection rate as a time-dependent function (SEIRD(rm)). Preliminary results on Lombardia and Emilia-Romagna regions confirm that SEIRD(rm) fits the data more accurately than the original SEIRD model with constant rate infection parameter. Moreover, the increased flexibility in the choice of the infection rate function makes it possible to better control the predictions due to the lockdown policy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlthough by late February 2020 the COVID-19 epidemic was effectively controlled in Wuhan, China, the virus has since spread around the world and been declared a pandemic on March 11. Estimating the effects of interventions, such as transportation restrictions and quarantine measures, on the early COVID-19 transmission dynamics in Wuhan is critical for guiding future virus containment strategies. Since the exact number of COVID-19 infected cases is unknown, the number of documented cases was used by many disease transmission models to infer epidemiological parameters. However, this means that it would not be possible to adequately estimate epidemiological parameters and the effects of intervention measures, because the percentage of all infected cases that were documented changed during the first 2 months of the epidemic as a consequence of a gradually increasing diagnostic capability.\n\nMethodsTo overcome the limitations, we constructed a stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) model, accounting for intervention measures and temporal changes in the proportion of new documented infections out of total new infections, to characterize the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan across different stages of the outbreak. Pre-symptomatic transmission was taken into account in our model, and all epidemiological parameters were estimated using Particle Markov-chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) method.\n\nResultsOur model captured the local Wuhan epidemic pattern as a two-peak transmission dynamics, with one peak on February 4 and the other on February 12, 2020. The impact of intervention measures determined the timing of the first peak, leading to an 86% drop in the Re from 3.23 (95% CI, 2.22 to 4.20) to 0.45 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.69). An improved diagnostic capability led to the second peak and a higher proportion of documented infections. Our estimated proportion of new documented infections out of the total new infections increased from 11% (95% CI 1% - 43%) to 28% (95% CI 4% - 62%) after January 26 when more detection kits were released. After the introduction of a new diagnostic criterion (case definition) on February 12, a higher proportion of daily infected cases were documented (49% (95% CI 7% - 79%)).",

    "abstract": "Concerning the two approaches to the Covid-19 case mortality rate published in the literature, namely computing the ratio of (a) the daily number of deaths to a time delayed daily number of confirmed infections; and (b) the cumulative number of deaths to confirmed infections up to a certain time, both numbers having been acquired in the middle of an outbreak, it is shown that each suffers from systematic error of a different source. We further show that in the absence of detailed knowledge of the time delay distribution of (a), the true case mortality rate is obtained by pursuing method (b) at the end of the outbreak when the fate of every case has decisively been rendered. The approach is then employed to calculate the mean case mortality rate of 13 regions of China where every case has already been resolved. This leads to a mean rate of 0.527 {+/-} 0.001 %.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesThe extent to which people implement government-issued protective measures is critical in preventing further spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Our study aimed to evaluate the public belief in the effectiveness of protective measures, the reported implementation of these measures in daily life, and to identify communication channels used to acquire relevant information on COVID-19 in European countries.\n\nDesignA cross-sectional online survey available in multiple languages was disseminated on social media starting March 19th, 2020. After five days, we computed descriptive statistics for countries with more than 500 respondents. Each day, we compiled and categorized community containment measures enacted in each country by stringency (stage I-IV). Response collection continued for one week to explore possible dynamics as containment strategies intensified.\n\nParticipantsIn total, 9,796 adults responded, of whom 8,611 resided in the Netherlands (stage III), 604 in Germany (stage III), and 581 in Italy (stage IV). An additional 1,365 respondents completed the survey in the following week.\n\nResultsParticipants indicated support for governmental measures related to avoiding social gatherings, selective closure of public places, and hand hygiene and respiratory measures (range for all measures: 95.0%-99.7%). Respondents from the Netherlands were less likely to consider a complete social lockdown effective (59.2%), compared to respondents in Germany (76.6%) or Italy (87.2%). Italian residents did not only apply enforced social distancing measures more frequently (range: 90.2%-99.3%, German and Dutch residents: 67.5%-97.0%), but also self-initiated hygienic and social distancing behaviors (range: 36.3%-96.6%, German and Dutch residents: 28.3%-95.7%). Respondents largely reported being sufficiently informed about the COVID-19 outbreak and about behaviors to avoid infection (range across countries: 90.2%-91.1%). Information channels most commonly reported included television (range: 53.0%-82.0%), newspapers (range: 31.0%-63.0%), official health websites (range: 39.0%-54.1%), and social media (range: 40.0%-55.8%). We observed no major changes in answers over time.\n\nConclusionsIn European countries, the degree of public belief in the effectiveness of protective measures was high and residents reported to be sufficiently informed by various communication channels. In March 2020, implementation of enacted and self-initiated measures differed between countries and were highest among Italian respondents, who were subjected to the most elaborate measures of social lockdown and greatest COVID-19 burden in Europe.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo estimate surge capacities and demands of Brazils health system in view of severe cases of the novel coronavirus disease.\n\nMethodsThree types of hospital equipments demanded by severe COVID-19 patients are considered: available intensive care unit (ICU) beds, existing surgery operating rooms and respirators located in other hospital areas. They are taken into account on a cumulative basis forming three levels of hospital equipment usage. Based on a mean duration of hospitalization for the disease, it is estimated the daily admission capacity of infected patients per state and for the entire country for each level of hospital equipment usage. Furthermore, an exponential regression model is fitted by means of the daily national number of new documented patients. The prediction intervals for the number of new patients for certain days in the immediate future are then calculated and compared to the admissible daily demand for the three incremental groups of equipments. The data are made publicly available by the Brazilian federal government and are gathered and analyzed by means of the Python programming language.\n\nResults41% of the (adult) ICU beds in Brazil were available during 2019, indicating that this hospital equipment is not on average operating near capacity in national numbers. Nevertheless, there is a marked heterogeneity in the absolute and relative numbers of available and existing ICU beds and existing surgery operating rooms and extra respirators between its states.\n\nConclusionsThe remarkable differences between states reflect into the number of possible daily admissions of COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure for the three considered levels of hospital equipment usage. In national numbers, Brazils health system is estimated to be capable of daily admitting 693, 1243 and 2166 severe patients under the three studied scenarios. The fitted model predicted that only the first limit, if any, would be reached.",

    "abstract": "We present a stochastic optimization model for allocating and sharing a critical resource in the case of a pandemic. The demand for different entities peaks at different times, and an initial inventory for a central agency is to be allocated. The entities (states) may share the critical resource with a different state under a risk-averse condition. The model is applied to study the allocation of ventilator inventory in the COVID-19 pandemic by FEMA to different US states. Findings suggest that if less than 60% of the ventilator inventory is available for non-COVID-19 patients, FEMAs stockpile of 20,000 ventilators (as of 03/23/2020) would be nearly adequate to meet the projected needs in slightly above average demand scenarios. However, when more than 75% of the available ventilator inventory must be reserved for non-COVID-19 patients, various degrees of shortfall are expected. In a severe case, where the demand is concentrated in the top-most quartile of the forecast confidence interval and states are not willing to share their stockpile of ventilators, the total shortfall over the planning horizon (till 05/31/20) is about 232,000 ventilator days, with a peak shortfall of 17,200 ventilators on 04/19/2020. Results are also reported for a worst-case where the demand is at the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEstimating the prevalence of severe or critical illness and case fatality of COVID-19 outbreak in December, 2019 remains a challenge due to biases associated with surveillance, data synthesis and reporting. We aimed to address this limitation in a systematic review and meta-analysis and to examine the clinical, biochemical and radiological risk factors in a meta-regression.\n\nMethodsPRISMA guidelines were followed. PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched using pre-specified keywords on March 07, 2020. Peer-reviewed empirical studies examining rates of severe illness, critical illness and case fatality among COVID-19 patients were examined. Numerators and denominators to compute the prevalence rates and risk factors were extracted. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed. Results were corrected for publication bias. Meta-regression analyses examined the moderator effects of potential risk factors.\n\nResultsThe meta-analysis included 29 studies representing 2,090 individuals. Pooled rates of severe illness, critical illness and case fatality among COVID-19 patients were 15%, 5% and 0.8% respectively. Adjusting for potential underreporting and publication bias, increased these estimates to 26%, 16% and 7.4% respectively. Increasing age and elevated LDH consistently predicted severe / critical disease and case fatality. Hypertension; fever and dyspnea at presentation; and elevated CRP predicted increased severity.\n\nConclusionsRisk factors that emerged in our analyses predicting severity and case fatality should inform clinicians to define endophenotypes possessing a greater risk. Estimated case fatality rate of 7.4% after correcting for publication bias underscores the importance of strict adherence to preventive measures, case detection, surveillance and reporting.",

    "abstract": "With sensitivity of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test used to detect the presence of the virus in the human host, the global health community has been able to record a great number of recovered population. Therefore, in a bid to answer a burning question of reinfection in the recovered class, the model equations which exhibits the disease-free equilibrium (E0) state for COVID-19 coronavirus was developed in this study and was discovered to both exist as well as satisfy the criteria for a locally or globally asymptotic stability with a basic reproductive number R0 = 0 for and endemic situation. Hence, there is a chance of no secondary reinfections from the recovered population as the rate of incidence of the recovered population vanishes, that is, B = 0.\n\nFurthermore, numerical simulations were carried to complement the analytical results in investigating the effect of the implementation of quarantine and observatory procedures has on the projection of the further spread of the virus globally. Result shows that the proportion of infected population in the absence of curative vaccination will continue to grow globally meanwhile the recovery rate will continue slowly which therefore means that the ratio of infection to recovery rate will determine the death rate that is recorded globally and most significant for this study is the rate of reinfection by the recovered population which will decline to zero over time as the virus is cleared clinically from the system of the recovered class.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesTo establish the optimal parameters for group testing of pooled specimens for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nMethodsThe most efficient pool size was determined to be 5 specimens using a web-based application. From this analysis, 25 experimental pools were created using 50 microliter from one SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal specimen mixed with 4 negative patient specimens (50 microliter each) for a total volume of 250 microliter l. Viral RNA was subsequently extracted from each pool and tested using the CDC SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. Positive pools were consequently split into individual specimens and tested by extraction and PCR. This method was also tested on an unselected group of 60 nasopharyngeal specimens grouped into 12-pools.\n\nResultsAll 25 pools were positive with Cycle threshold (Ct) values within 0 and 5.03 Ct of the original individual specimens. The analysis of 60 specimens determined that two pools were positive followed by identification of two individual specimens among the 60 tested. This testing was accomplished while using 22 extractions/PCR tests, a savings of 38 reactions.\n\nConclusionsWhen the incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection is 10% or less, group testing will result in the saving of reagents and personnel time with an overall increase in testing capability of at least 69%.\n\nKey PointsSARS CoV-2, COVID-19, Group testing",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly respiratory infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) with multiple organ injuries. The aim of this study was to analyze SARS-CoV-2-induced acute liver injury (ALI), its association with death risk and prognosis after discharge.\n\nMethodsThree-hundred and fifty-five COVID-19 patients were recruited. Clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. ALI was evaluated and its prognosis was tracked. The association between ALI and death risk was analyzed.\n\nResultsOf 355 COVID-19 patients, 211 were common, 88 severe, and 51 critical ill cases, respectively. On admission, 223 (62.8%) patients were with hypoproteinemia, 151(42.5%) with cholestasis, and 101 (28.5%) with hepatocellular injury. As expected, ALI was more common in critical ill patients. By multivariate logistic regression, male, older age and lymphocyte reduction were three important independent risk factors predicting ALI among COVID-19 patients. Death risk analysis shows that fatality rate was higher among patients with hypoproteinemia than those without hypoproteinemia (RR=9.471, P<0.001). Moreover, fatality rate was higher among patients with cholestasis than those without cholestasis (RR=2.182, P<0.05). Follow-up observation found that more than one hepatic functional indexes of two-third patients remained abnormal 14 days after discharge.\n\nConclusionsALI at early stage elevates death risk of COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI has not recovered completely 14 days after discharge.",

    "abstract": "Background and objectiveSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been pandemic worldwide. Several reports observed a reduction of lymphocytes among COVID-19 patients. However, clinical significance of lymphocyte reduction in COVID-19 patients remains unclear. The objective of this study was to analyze the association between lymphocyte reduction at early stage and the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.\n\nMethodsAll 192 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Electronic medical records, including demographic data, clinical characteristics, comorbidities and exposure history, were collected. Biochemical indexes on admission and chest computed tomography (CT) were detected. Patients prognosis was followed up.\n\nResultsOn admission, 84 (43.8%) patients suffered from lymphocyte reduction among COVID-19 patients. The count and percentage of lymphocytes on admission were lower among more than seventy-year-old patients than those of younger patients. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that older age was a risk factor of lymphocyte reduction. Of interest, chest CT score, a key marker of lung injury, was increased among COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction. By contrast, PaCO2, SpO2 and oxygenation index, several respiratory function markers, were decreased in COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction. Moreover, TBIL and DBIL, two markers of hepatic injury, creatinine and urea nitrogen, two indices of renal function, and creatine kinase, AST and LDH, three myocardial enzymes, were elevated in COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction. Among 84 COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction, 32.1% died. Fatality rate was obviously higher in COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction than those with normal lymphocyte (RR=5.789, P<0.001).\n\nConclusionOlder COVID-19 patients are more susceptible to lymphocyte reduction. Lymphocyte reduction at early stage aggravates the severity of multiple organ injuries and elevates death risk of COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "Compartment models of infectious diseases, such as SEIR, are being used extensively to model the COVID-19 epidemic. Transitions between compartments are modelled either as instantaneous rates in differential equations, or as transition probabilities in discrete time difference or matrix equations. These models give accurate estimates of the position of equilibrium points, when the rate at which individuals enter each stage is equal to the rate at which they exit from it. However, they do not accurately capture the distribution of times that an individual spends in each compartment, so do not accurately capture the transient dynamics of epidemics. Here we show how matrix models can provide a straightforward route to accurately model stage durations, and thus correctly reproduce epidemic dynamics. We apply this approach to modelling the dynamics of a COVID-19 epidemic. We show that a SEIR model underestimates peak infection rates (by a factor of three using published parameter estimates based on the progress of the epidemic in Wuhan) and substantially overestimates epidemic persistence after the peak has passed.",

    "abstract": "The responsible estimation of parameters is a main issue of mathematical pandemic models. Especially a good choice of {beta} as the number of others that one infected person encounters per unit time (per day) influences the adequateness of the results of the model. For the example of the actual COVID-19 pandemic some aspects of the parameter choice will be discussed. Because of the incompatibility of the data of the Johns-Hopkins-University [3] to the data of the German Robert-Koch-Institut we use the COVID-19 data of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [2] (ECDC) as a base for the parameter estimation. Two different mathematical methods for the data analysis will be discussed in this paper and possible sources of trouble will be shown.\n\nParameters for several countries like UK, USA, Italy, Spain, Germany and China will be estimated and used in W. O. Kermack and A. G. McKendricks SIR model[1]. Strategies for the commencing and ending of social and economic shutdown measures are discussed.\n\nThe numerical solution of the ordinary differential equation system of the modified SIR model is being done with a Runge-Kutta integration method of fourth order [4].\n\nAt the end the applicability of the SIR model could be shown. Suggestions about appropriate points in time at which to commence with lockdown measures based on the acceleration rate of infections conclude the paper. This paper is an improved sequel of [5].",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions have been implemented to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK. Projecting the size of an unmitigated epidemic and the potential effect of different control measures has been critical to support evidence-based policymaking during the early stages of the epidemic.\n\nMethodsWe used a stochastic age-structured transmission model to explore a range of intervention scenarios, including the introduction of school closures, social distancing, shielding of elderly groups, self-isolation of symptomatic cases, and extreme \"lockdown\"-type restrictions. We simulated different durations of interventions and triggers for introduction, as well as combinations of interventions. For each scenario, we projected estimated new cases over time, patients requiring inpatient and critical care (intensive care unit, ICU) treatment, and deaths.\n\nFindingsWe found that mitigation measures aimed at reducing transmission would likely have decreased the reproduction number, but not sufficiently to prevent ICU demand from exceeding NHS availability. To keep ICU bed demand below capacity in the model, more extreme restrictions were necessary. In a scenario where \"lockdown\"-type interventions were put in place to reduce transmission, these interventions would need to be in place for a large proportion of the coming year in order to prevent healthcare demand exceeding availability.\n\nInterpretationThe characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 mean that extreme measures are likely required to bring the epidemic under control and to prevent very large numbers of deaths and an excess of demand on hospital beds, especially those in ICUs.\n\nResearch in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSAs countries have moved from early containment efforts to planning for the introduction of large-scale non-pharmaceutical interventions to control COVID-19 outbreaks, epidemic modelling studies have explored the potential for extensive social distancing measures to curb transmission. However, it remains unclear how different combinations of interventions, timings, and triggers for the introduction and lifting of control measures may affect the impact of the epidemic on health services, and what the range of uncertainty associated with these estimates would be.\n\nAdded value of this studyUsing a stochastic, age-structured epidemic model, we explored how eight different intervention scenarios could influence the number of new cases and deaths, as well as intensive care beds required over the projected course of the epidemic. We also assessed the potential impact of local versus national targeting of interventions, reduction in leisure events, impact of increased childcare by grandparents, and timing of triggers for different control measures. We simulated multiple realisations for each scenario to reflect uncertainty in possible epidemic trajectories.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceOur results support early modelling findings, and subsequent empirical observations, that in the absence of control measures, a COVID-19 epidemic could quickly overwhelm a healthcare system. We found that even a combination of moderate interventions - such as school closures, shielding of older groups and self-isolation - would be unlikely to prevent an epidemic that would far exceed available ICU capacity in the UK. Intermittent periods of more intensive lockdown-type measures are predicted to be effective for preventing the healthcare system from being overwhelmed.",

    "abstract": "When a region tries to prevent an outbreak of an epidemic, like that of COVID-19, two broad strategies are initially available: limiting the inflow of infected cases using travel restrictions and quarantines, and reducing the transmissions from inflowing cases using contact tracing and community interventions. A large number of papers have used epidemiological models to argue that inflow restrictions are unlikely to be effective. We conduct a mathematical analysis using a simple epidemiological model and perform simulations which show how this conclusion changes if we relax the assumption of unlimited capacity in containment efforts such as contact tracing. In particular, when contact tracing is effective, but the system is close to being overwhelmed, moderate travel restrictions can have a very large effect on the probability of an epidemic.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the rapid spread of COVID-19 all across the globe, we have performed simulations of a system dynamic epidemic spread model in different possible situations. The simulation, not only captures the model dynamic of the spread of the virus, but also, takes care of population and mobility data. The model is calibrated based on epidemic data and events specifically of Sultanate of Oman, which can easily be generalized. The simulation results are quite disturbing, indicating that, during a process of stringent social distancing and testing strategies, a small perturbation can lead to quite undesirable outcomes. The simulation results, although consistent in expected outcomes across changing parameters values, also indicate a substantial mismatch with real numbers. An analysis of what can be the reason of this mismatch is also performed. Within these contradictions, for Oman, regarding the eradication of epidemic, the future is not extremely alarming.",

    "abstract": "There has been extensive speculation on the apparent differences in mortality between countries reporting on the confirmed cases and deaths due to Covid-19. A number of explanations have been suggested, but there is no clear evidence about how apparent fatality rates may be expected to vary with the different testing regimes, admission policies and other variables. An individual patient simulation model was developed to address this question. Parameters and sensitivity analysis based upon recent international data sources for Covid-19 and results were averaged over 100 iterations for a simulated cohort of over 500,000 patients.\n\nDifferent testing regimes for Covid-19 were considered; testing admitted patients only, various rates of community testing of symptomatic cases and active contact-tracing and screening.\n\nIn the base case analysis, apparent mortality ranged from 10.5% under a policy of testing only admitted patients to 0.4% with intensive contact tracing and community testing. These findings were sensitive to assumptions regarding admission rates and the rate of spread, with more selective admission policies and suppression of spread increasing the apparent mortality and the potential for apparent mortality rates to exceed 18% under some circumstances. Under all scenarios the proportion of patients tested in the community had the greatest impact on apparent mortality.\n\nWhilst differences in mortality due to health service and demographic factors cannot be excluded, the current international differences in reported mortality are all consistent with differences in practice regarding screening, community testing and admission policies.",

Mathematical models can help define the scale of an epidemic and the rate at which an infection can spread in a community. We used an SIR model to predict the magnitude of the COVID-19 epidemic in Pakistan and compared the numbers with the reported cases on the national database. Our results indicate that Pakistan could hit peak number of infectious cases on May 26th, 2020 and by June 24th, 2020, 90% of the population will have become infected with the virus if policy interventions seeking to curb this infection are not adopted aggressively.",

    "abstract": "The current spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Europe threats Italians capacity and that of other national health systems to effectively respond to the needs of patients who require intensive care, mostly due to pneumonia and derived complications from concomitant disease and age. Predicting the surge in capacity has proved difficult due to the requirement of a subtle combination of diverse expertise and difficult choices to be made on selecting robust measures of critical care utilization, and parsimonious epidemic modelling which account for changing government measures. We modelled the required surge capacity of ICU beds in Italy exclusively for COVID-19 patients at epidemic peak. Because new measures were imposed by the Italian government, suspending nearly all non-essential sectors of the economy, we included the potential impacts of these new measures. The modelling considered those hospitalized and home isolated as quarantined, mimicking conditions on the ground. The percentage of patients in intensive care (out of the daily active confirmed cases) required for our calculations were chosen based on clinical relevance and robustness, and this number was consistently on average 9{middle dot}9% from February 24 to March 6, 2020. Five different scenarios were produced (two positive and three negative). Under most positive scenarios, in which R0 is reduced below 1 (i.e., 0 {middle dot}71), the number of daily active confirmed cases will peak at nearly 89 000 by the early days of April and the total number of intensive care beds exclusively dedicated to COVID-19 patients required in Italy estimated at 8791. Worst scenarios produce unmanageable numbers. Our results suggest that the decisive moment for Italy has come. Jointly reinforcement by the government of the measures approved so far, including home confinement, but even more important the full commitment of the civil society in respecting home confinement, social distancing and hygiene will be key in the next days. Yet, even under the best circumstances, intensive care capacity will need to get closer to 9000 units in the country to avoid preventable mortality. So far, only strong measures were effective in Italy, as shown by our modelling, and this may offer an opportunity to European countries to accelerate their interventions.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge for estimating the epidemiological parameters of the COVID-19 out-break in Wuhan is the discrepancy between the officially reported number of infections and the true number of infections. A common approach to tackling the challenge is to use the number of infections exported from Wuhan to infer the true number in the city. This approach can only provide a static estimate of the epidemiological parameters before Wuhan lockdown on January 23, 2020, because there are almost no exported cases thereafter. Here, we propose a method to dynamically estimate the epidemiological parameters of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan by recovering true numbers of infections from day-to-day official numbers. Using the method, we provide a comprehensive retrospection on how the disease had progressed in Wuhan from January 19 to March 5, 2020. Particularly, we estimate that the outbreak sizes by January 23 and March 5 were 11,239 [95% CI 4,794-22,372] and 124,506 [95% CI 69,526-265,113], respectively. The effective reproduction number attained its maximum on January 24 (3.42 [95% CI 3.34-3.50]) and became less than 1 from February 7 (0.76 [95% CI 0.65-0.92]). We also estimate the effects of two major government interventions on the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan. In particular, transportation suspension and large scale hospitalization respectively prevented 33,719 and 90,072 people from getting infected in the nine-day time period right after its implementation.",

Outcomes included any acute respiratory illness and its related consequences.\n\nDATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSISSix authors independently assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool and extracted data. We used a generalised inverse variance method for pooling using a random-effects model and reported results with risk ratios and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI).\n\nRESULTSWe included 15 randomised trials investigating the effect of masks (14 trials) in healthcare workers and the general population and of quarantine (1 trial). We found no trials testing eye protection. Compared to no masks there was no reduction of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases (Risk Ratio 0.93, 95%CI 0.83 to 1.05) or influenza (Risk Ratio 0.84, 95%CI 0.61-1.17) for masks in the general population, nor in healthcare workers (Risk Ratio 0.37, 95%CI 0.05 to 2.50). There was no difference between surgical masks and N95 respirators: for ILI (Risk Ratio 0.83, 95%CI 0.63 to 1.08), for influenza (Risk Ratio 1.02, 95%CI 0.73 to 1.43). Harms were poorly reported and limited to discomfort with lower compliance. The only trial testing quarantining workers with household ILI contacts found a reduction in ILI cases, but increased risk of quarantined workers contracting influenza. All trials were conducted during seasonal ILI activity.\n\nCONCLUSIONSMost included trials had poor design, reporting and sparse events. There was insufficient evidence to provide a recommendation on the use of facial barriers without other measures. We found insufficient evidence for a difference between surgical masks and N95 respirators and limited evidence to support effectiveness of quarantine. Based on observational evidence from the previous SARS epidemic included in the previous version of our Cochrane review we recommend the use of masks combined with other measures.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe medical, health service, societal and economic impact of the COVID-19 emergency has unknown effects on overall population mortality. Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom (to date at least) have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high risk conditions or their longer term background (pre-COVID-19) mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence rates and differing mortality impacts.\n\nMethodsUsing population based linked primary and secondary care electronic health records in England (HDR UK - CALIBER), we report the prevalence of underlying conditions defined by UK Public Health England COVID-19 guidelines (16 March 2020) in 3,862,012 individuals aged [&ge;]30 years from 1997-2017. We used previously validated phenotypes, openly available (https://caliberresearch.org/portal), for each condition using ICD-10 diagnosis, Read, procedure and medication codes. We estimated the 1-year mortality in each condition, and developed simple models of excess COVID-19-related deaths assuming relative risk (RR) of the impact of the emergency (compared to background mortality) of 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0.\n\nFindings20.0% of the population are at risk according to current PHE guidelines, of which; 13.7% were age>70 years and 6.3% aged [&le;]70 years with [&ge;]1 underlying condition (cardiovascular disease (2.3%), diabetes (2.2%), steroid therapy (1.9%), severe obesity (0.9%), chronic kidney disease (0.6%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD (0.5%). Multimorbidity (co-occurrence of [&ge;]2 conditions in an individual) was common (10.1%). The 1-year mortality in the at-risk population was 4.46%, and age and underlying conditions combine to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions (5.9% in age>70 years, 8.6% for COPD and 13.1% in those with [&ge;]3 or more conditions). In a suppression scenario (at SARS CoV2 rates of 0.001% of the UK population), there would be minimal excess deaths (3 and 7 excess deaths at relative risk, RR, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). At SARS CoV2 rates of 10% of the UK population (mitigation) the model estimates the numbers of excess deaths as: 13791, 34479 and 68957 (at RR 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). At SARS CoV2 rates of 80% in the UK population (\"do-nothing\"), the model estimates the number of excess deaths as 110332, 275,830 and 551,659 (at RR 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0) respectively.\n\nInterpretationWe provide the public, researchers and policy makers a simple model to estimate the excess mortality over 1 year from COVID-19, based on underlying conditions at different ages. If the relative mortality impact of COVID-19 were to be about 20% (similar magnitude as the established winter vs summer mortality excess), then the excess deaths would be 0 when 1 in 100 000 (suppression), 13791 when 1 in 10 (mitigation) and 110332 when 8 in 10 are infected (\"do nothing\") scenario. However, the relative impact of COVID-19 is unknown. If the emergency were to double the mortality risk, then we estimate 7, 68957 and 551,659 excess deaths in the same scenarios. These results may inform the need for more stringent suppression measures as well as efforts to target those at highest risk for a range of preventive interventions.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesNot all workers are employed in occupations in which working from home is possible. These workers are at an increased risk for exposure to infectious disease during a pandemic event, and are more likely to experience events of job displacement and disruption during all types of public health emergencies. Here, I characterized which occupational sectors in the United States are most able to work from home during a public health emergency such as COVID-19.\n\nMethods2018 national employment and wage data maintained by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was merged with measures from the BLS O*NET survey data. The measures utilized rank the importance of using a computer at work, and the importance of working with or performing for the public, which relate to the ability to complete work at home.\n\nResultsAbout 25% (35.6 M) of the U.S. workforce are employed in occupations which could be done from home, primarily in sectors such as technology, computer, management, administrative, financial, and engineering. The remaining 75% of U.S. workers (including healthcare, manufacturing, retail and food services, et al.) are employed in occupations where working from home would be difficult.\n\nConclusionsThe majority of U.S. workers are employed in occupations that cannot be done at home, putting 108.4 M U.S. workers at increased risk for adverse health outcomes related to working during a public health emergency. These workers tend to be lower paid than workers who can work from home. During COVID-19, this could result in a large increase in the burden of mental health disorders in the U.S., in addition to increased cases of COVID-19 due to workplace transmission. Public health guidance to \"work from home\" is not applicable to the majority of the U.S. workforce, emphasizing the need for additional guidance for workers during public health emergencies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA pandemic of 2019 novel corona virus disease (COVID-19), which was first reported in Wuhan city, has affected more than 100,000 patients worldwide. Patients with cancer are at a higher risk of COVID-19, but currently, there is no guidance on the management of cancer patients during this outbreak. Here, we report the infection control measures and early outcomes of patients who received radiotherapy (RT) at a tertiary cancer centre in Wuhan.\n\nMethodsWe reviewed all patients who were treated at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (ZHWU) from Jan 20 to Mar 6, 2020. This preceded the city lock-down date of Jan 23, 2020. Infection control measures were implemented, which included a clinical pathway for managing suspect COVID-19 cases, on-site screening, modifications to the RT facility, and protection of healthcare workers. Primary end-point was infection rate among patients and healthcare staff. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the 5th edition criteria.\n\nFindings209 patients completed RT during the study period. Median age was 55 y (IQR = 48-64). Thoracic, head and neck, and lower gastrointestinal and gynaecological cancer patients consisted the majority of patients. Treatment sites included thoracic (38.3%), head and neck (25.4%), and abdomen and pelvis (25.8%); 47.4%, 27.3%, and 25.4% of treatments were for adjuvant, radical, and palliative indications, respectively. 188 treatments/day were performed prior to the lock-down, in contrast to 12.4 treatments/day post-lock-down. Only one (0.48%) patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period. No healthcare worker was infected.\n\nInterpretationHerein, we show that in a susceptible population to COVID-19, strict infection control measures can curb human-to-human transmission, and ensure timely delivery of RT to cancer patients.\n\nFundingThis study was funded by Health Commission of Hubei Province Scientific Research Project, WJ2019H002, Health Commission of Hubei Province Medical Leading Talent Project.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is now a global pandemic. Cancer patients are at risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, and thus infection control measures are crucial to mitigate their risk of infection. We searched PubMed and Medline for articles published up to Mar 12, 2020, using the following keywords: \"COVID-19\", \"SARS\", \"SARS-CoV-2\", \"infection control\", and \"cancer\". No evidence exists that informs on the appropriate infection control measures for COVID-19.\n\nAdded value of this studyWe report our single centre experience on the detailed infection control measures that were undertaken to minimise cross transmission between cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy, and between patients and healthcare workers. Measures entailing screening of suspect cases, re-organisation of the treatment facility, and protection of healthcare workers were described. With our infection control protocol, we recorded only one COVID-19 case among the 209 patients (0.48%) who were treated at our centre during the period of Jan 20 to Mar 6, 2020. No healthcare worker was affected.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceThe effective infection control measures outlined in this study will help institutions worldwide affected by COVID-19 to formulate guidelines to mitigate nosocomial human-to-human transmission, especially among susceptible patients.",

    "abstract": "As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), started in China in January, 2020, repurposing approved drugs is emerging as important therapeutic options. We reported here the first clinical study using hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor, danoprevir, to treat COVID-19 patients. Danoprevir (Ganovo(R)) is a potent HCV protease (NS3/4A) inhibitor (IC50 = 0.29 nM), which was approved and marketed in China since 2018 to treat chronic hepatitis C patients. Ritonavir is a CYP3A4 inhibitor to enhance plasma concentration of danoprevir while it also acts as a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor at high doses. The chymotrypsin-like protease of SARS-CoV-2 shares structure similarity with HCV and HIV proteases. In the current clinical study (NCT04291729) conducted at the Nineth Hospital of Nanchang, we evaluated therapeutic effects of danoprevir, boosted by ritonavir, on treatment naive and experienced COVID-19 patients. The data from this small-sample clinical study showed that danoprevir boosted by ritonavir is safe and well tolerated in all patients. After 4 to 12-day treatment of danoprevir boosted by ritonavir, all eleven patients enrolled, two naive and nine experienced, were discharged from the hospital as they met all four conditions as follows: (1) normal body temperature for at least 3 days; (2) significantly improved respiratory symptoms; (3) lung imaging shows obvious absorption and recovery of acute exudative lesion; and (4) two consecutive RT-PCR negative tests of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide acid (respiratory track sampling with interval at least one day). Our findings suggest that repurposing danoprevir for COVID-19 is a promising therapeutic option.",

    "abstract": "This study shows that the disease free equilibrium (E0) for COVID-19 coronavirus does not satisfy the criteria for a locally or globally asymptotic stability. This implies that as a pandemic as declared by WHO (2020) the COVID-19 coronavirus does not have a curative vaccine yet and precautionary measures are advised through quarantine and observatory procedures. Also, the Basic Reproductive number (R0 < 1) by Equation (33) shows that there is a chance of decline of secondary infections when the ratio between the incidence rate in the population and the total number of infected population quarantined with observatory procedure.\n\nThe effort to evaluate the disease equilibrium shows that unless there is a dedicated effort from government, decision makers and stakeholders, the world would hardly be reed of the COVID-19 coronavirus and further spread is eminent and the rate of infection will continue to increase despite the increased rate of recovery because of the absence of vaccine at the moment.",

    "abstract": "One of the greatest threats to humanity is the emergence of a pandemic virus. Among those with the greatest potential for such an event include influenza viruses and coronaviruses. In the last century alone, we have observed four major influenza A virus pandemics as well as the emergence of three highly pathogenic coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As no effective antiviral treatments or vaccines are presently available against SARS-CoV-2, it is important to understand the host response to this virus as this may guide the efforts in development towards novel therapeutics. Here, we offer the first in-depth characterization of the host transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections through in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo model systems. Our data demonstrate the each virus elicits both core antiviral components as well as unique transcriptional footprints. Compared to the response to influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV-2 elicits a muted response that lacks robust induction of a subset of cytokines including the Type I and Type III interferons as well as a numerous chemokines. Taken together, these data suggest that the unique transcriptional signature of this virus may be responsible for the development of COVID-19.",
