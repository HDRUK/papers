We performed two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in UK Biobank COVID-19 positive individuals to identify the genetic variants associated with Long COVID (LC) and post-acute cardiovascular complications of SARS-CoV-2 (PACS-CVD). The LC cohort comprised 8,469 participants (68% cases). The PACS-CVD cohort included 105,175 individuals (2% cases). LC GWAS identified 15 independent signals at suggestive significance (p-value<5×10⁻⁶), with 73.3% validated. The fully validated variant, rs12335232 (ADCY8), has been linked to memory decline, COVID-19 infection and severity. Other loci were near CHRNA7 (neuroinflammation, COVID-19 severity) and RNU7-126P (COVID-19 hospitalization). These findings consistently demonstrate shared biological pathways between acute infection and persistent symptoms. PACS-CVD GWAS identified 14 suggestive loci, mainly near genes linked to cardiovascular and metabolic functions (SAYSD1/KCNK5, FLT1) or COVID-19 severity (ROR2).

Dexamethasone (at a dose of 6mg daily), tocilizumab, baricitinib, and the monoclonal antibodies casirivimab-imdevimab and sotrovimab were shown to reduce 28-day mortality in all or specific groups of patients. Here we report the long-term efficacy and safety of all sixteen therapies. <h4>Methods</h4>  Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 were potentially eligible to join this randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial. Participants were randomly allocated to receive each trial treatment, or not, on top of usual care. Analyses were by intention to treat comparing each treatment with its own usual care control group. The pre-specified primary long-term follow-up outcome was 6-month all-cause mortality, presented as mortality rate ratios adjusted for baseline age and ventilation status. The key safety outcomes were major non-COVID infection and non-COVID death at 6 months. ISRCTN50189673 and NCT04381936 . <h4>Findings</h4>  Between 19 March 2020 and 19 March 2024, 48,402 patients were included in RECOVERY COVID-19 treatment comparisons. For each of the treatments previously demonstrated to be effective at 28 days, the early mortality benefit was preserved up to 6 months. Among 6425 patients in the dexamethasone (6mg daily) comparison, 6-month mortality was 34.3% vs 44.4% in the invasive mechanical ventilation group (rate ratio [RR] 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55–0.85; p=0.0006); 27.7% vs 29.2% in the oxygen or non-invasive ventilation group (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.77–0.99; p=0.034); and 26.1% vs 22.5% in the no oxygen group (RR 1.10; 95% CI 0.89–1.36; p=0.39); test for trend p=0.0024. Among 4116 patients in the tocilizumab comparison, 34.3% vs 38.9% died within 6 months (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.79–0.96; p=0.0077). Among 8156 patients in the baricitinib comparison, 15.7% vs. 16.6% died (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.80–0.99; p=0.032). Among 3153 anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum antibody negative patients (the primary analysis population) in the casirivimab-imdevimab comparison, 29.3% vs. 34.7% died (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.77–0.98; p=0.024). Among 720 patients with high serum nucleocapsid antigen concentration (the primary analysis population) in the sotrovimab comparison, 33.0% vs. 38.6% died (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.61–1.00; p=0.050). In line with the 28-day results, aspirin, azithromycin, colchicine, convalescent plasma, dimethyl fumarate, empagliflozin, lopinavir-ritonavir, molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir did not reduce 6-month mortality. Mortality at 6 months was higher with hydroxychloroquine therapy (33.3% vs. 30.2%; RR 1.14; 95% CI 1.02–1.27; p=0.018) and, among hypoxic patients not requiring ventilatory support, with higher dose dexamethasone (initial dose 20mg daily, 22.0% vs. 17.6%, RR 1.34; 95% CI 1.04–1.72; p=0.021). Allocation to dexamethasone 6mg once daily resulted in a small increase in major non-COVID infection within 6 months compared with usual care (21.4% vs. 19.1%; absolute difference 2.2%; 95% CI 0.2–4.5%). We found no evidence that any other treatments increased the risk of major non-COVID infection. <h4>Interpretation</h4>  In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, dexamethasone (at a dose of 6mg daily in hypoxic patients), tocilizumab (in hypoxic patients with CRP ≥75 mg/L), baricitinib, casirivimab-imdevimab (in seronegative patients), and sotrovimab (in high antigen patients) reduced 6-month mortality. Dexamethasone at a dose of 6mg daily was associated with an increase in major non-COVID infection but there was no evidence of other later emerging harms. Other treatments tested in RECOVERY did not reduce 6-month mortality. <h4>Funding</h4>  UK Research and Innovation (Medical Research Council) and National Institute for Health and Care Research (Grant ref: MC_PC_19056), and Wellcome Trust (Grant Ref: 222406/Z/20/Z).",,doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.08.29.25334732; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR1077612; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR1077612&type=FILE&fileName=EMS208523-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Without extended use of direct-acting antivirals FIP is invariably fatal, but there is potential for the emergence of anti-viral resistance. To understand host and viral factors associated with FIP, multiple tissues from cats with and without FIP were subjected to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and targeted sequencing of the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire was conducted for mesenteric lymph nodes in a larger cohort. Samples from cats with FIP demonstrated higher expression of genes involved in type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokine signalling, as well as the adaptive immune response, and expression of these genes was highly correlated with FCoV abundance. Analysis of FCoV genomic variation across tissues revealed dynamic within-host evolution of FCoV, and identified distinct mutations associated with systemic virus spread both within and among cats. Assembly of TCR and B-cell receptor (BCR) sequences identified changes in the immune repertoire associated with FIP, highlighting the polyclonality and ineffectiveness of the immune response to FCoV in cats with FIP, and revealing the presence of potentially protective TCR clonotypes in cats without FIP. Together, these results represent the first analysis of immune repertoire in any feline infectious disease and demonstrate naturally occurring within-host evolution of FCoV. These novel insights into a life-threatening systemic coronaviral disease have the potential to transform therapeutic approaches in FIP.",,doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.10.02.679983; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR1094798; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR1094798&type=FILE&fileName=EMS209443-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We compare current self-reported health, quality of life and symptom profiles for people with ongoing symptoms following COVID-19 to those who have never had COVID-19 or have recovered. <h4>Methods</h4> A cohort study was established with participants from the REACT programme. A sample (N=800,000) of adults were contacted between August and December 2022 to complete a questionnaire about their current health and COVID-19 history. We used logistic regression to identify predictors of persistent symptoms lasting ≥12 weeks following COVID-19. We fitted Accelerated Failure Time models to assess factors associated with rate of recovery from persistent symptoms. <h4>Findings</h4> Overall, 276,840/800,000 (34.6%) of invited participants completed the questionnaire. Median duration of COVID-related symptoms (N=130,251) was 1.3 weeks (inter-quartile range 6 days to 2 weeks), with 7.5% and 5.2% reporting ongoing symptoms ≥12 weeks and ≥52 weeks respectively. Female sex, having ≥1 comorbidity, more severe symptoms at time of COVID-19 and being infected when Wild-type variant was dominant were associated with higher probability of symptoms lasting ≥12 weeks. Longer time to recovery in those with persistent symptoms was found for females, people with comorbidities, living in more deprived areas, current smokers and for Wild-type compared to later variants. Mental health and health-related quality of life were significantly worse among participants with ongoing persistent COVID-19 symptoms compared with those who had never had COVID-19 or had recovered. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Although COVID-19 is usually of short duration, some adults experience persistent and burdensome illness. <h4>Funding</h4> This work is independent research funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) (REACT Long COVID (REACT-LC) (COV-LT-0040)).

Many existing studies investigating asymptomatic immunity failed to recruit true asymptomatic individuals. Thus, we conducted a cohort study to evaluate humoral- and cell-mediated responses to infection and vaccination in well-defined asymptomatic young adults (the Asymptomatic COVID-19 in Education [ACE] cohort). Methods  Asymptomatic testing services located at three UK universities identified asymptomatic young adults who were subsequently recruited with age- and sex-matched symptomatic and uninfected controls. Blood and saliva samples were collected after SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan infection, and again after vaccination. Anti-spike antibody titres, neutralizing antibodies, and spike-specific T-cell responses were measured, against both Wuhan and Omicron variants. Results  Asymptomatic participants exhibited reduced Wuhan-specific neutralization antibodies pre- and post-vaccination, as well as fewer Omicron-specific neutralization antibodies post-vaccination, compared to symptomatic participants. Lower Wuhan and Omicron-specific IgG titres in asymptomatic individuals were also observed pre- and post-vaccination, compared to symptomatic participants. There were no differences in salivary IgA levels. Conventional flow cytometry analysis and multi-dimensional clustering analysis of indicated unvaccinated asymptomatic participants had significantly fewer Wuhan-specific IL-2 secreting CD4 + CD45RA + T cells and activated CD8 + T cells than symptomatic participants, though these differences dissipated after vaccination. Conclusions  Asymptomatic infection results in decreased antibody and T cell responses to further exposure to SARS-CoV-2 variants, compared to symptomatic infection.

We compared receipt of guideline-informed acute MI care by mental disorder and assessed how the COVID-19 pandemic affected associations. <h4>Methods</h4>  We identified people with MI in England (November 2019 - February 2023) from the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP), ascertaining prior mental disorder from linked hospitalisation and primary care records and extracting care standards from MINAP. We used logistic regression to compare care standards for ST-elevation MI (STEMI) and non-STEMI (NSTEMI) between people with each of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or depression versus those without any of these disorders, adjusting for confounders and investigating differences over time. <h4>Results</h4>  We included 131,075 NSTEMI and 79,045 STEMI cases. For NSTEMI, people with prior mental disorder had lower odds of angiography eligibility and receipt, cardiac ward admission and cardiac rehabilitation referral. Odds ratios (95% CIs) ranged from 0.25 (0.20, 0.31) for angiography receipt for schizophrenia to 0.92 (0.89, 0.96) for cardiac ward admission for depression. For STEMI, there was no evidence of care differences for depression; however, people with bipolar disorder were less likely to meet call-to-balloon targets and people with schizophrenia were less likely to be referred for cardiac rehabilitation and receive indicated secondary prevention medication. Disparities were generally unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic. <h4>Conclusions</h4>  People with a mental disorder are less likely to receive guideline-informed MI care, with variation by MI type, care standard and mental disorder. <h4>Summary</h4>  We used linked electronic health records from over 200 000 NSTEMI and STEMI patients in England to compare receipt of guideline-informed care for myocardial infarction by mental disorder status and assess how the COVID-19 pandemic affected associations.

Vaccines that protect against severe RSV infection are now available. <h4>Aim</h4> We aimed to describe the incidence, presentation, severity and clinical outcomes of RSV-associated ARI in hospitalised older adults using a new Hospital-based ARI Sentinel Surveillance (HARISS) system in England in the winter prior to RSV vaccine introduction. <h4>Methods</h4> Adults aged ≥65 years from seven hospitals admitted for ≥24 hours with symptomatic ARI were included. Three groups were identified: RSV positive; influenza positive; negative for RSV, influenza and SARS-CoV-2. We estimated the hospitalisation rate of RSV-associated ARI compared to influenza-associated ARI and assessed clinical outcomes using Poisson regression and mortality using Cox regression across groups. <h4>Results</h4> This surveillance study included 2743 adults. During the 2023/4 season the hospitalisation rate for RSV-associated ARI was 58.3 per 100,000, compared to 114.6 per 100,000 for influenza-associated ARI. Hospitalisation rates increased with age. Exacerbation of chronic illness including lung disease, heart disease or frailty was a frequent cause of admission in RSV-associated ARI, with a combined incidence of 33.1 per 100,000. The majority of adults with RSV-associated ARI had at least one comorbidity (81%); a high proportion with immunosuppression (26%). Symptoms and clinical outcomes including mortality were similar between RSV- and influenza-associated ARI; 30-day mortality 10.6% vs 8.7% (adjusted hazard ratio 0.85,95% confidence interval 0.6-1.2). <h4>Conclusion</h4> In England, RSV infection is a common cause of hospitalisation in older adults.

Adjusted Cox Proportional Hazard regression was used to quantify the association between CRD, asthma-related factors, COPD-related factors, and risk of cardiovascular events. CRD included asthma, COPD, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, or pulmonary fibrosis prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Asthma-specific factors included baseline asthma control, exacerbations, and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dose. COPD-specific risk factors included baseline ICS prescriptions and exacerbations. Secondary objectives quantified the impact of COVID-19 hospitalisation and vaccine dose on cardiovascular outcomes. <h4>Results</h4> Of 3,670,455 people, those with CRD had a modest higher risk of cardiovascular events (HR adj 1.11, 95%CI 1.07-1.14), heart failure (HR adj 1.15, 1.09-1.21), and pulmonary emboli (HR adj 1.20, 1.11-1.30) compared with people without CRD. In people with asthma, baseline exacerbations and high-dose ICS were associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular outcomes (HR adj 1.24, 1.15-1.34 and 1.12, 1.01-1.24, respectively). In people with COPD, exacerbations were associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular outcomes (HR adj 1.40, 1.28-1.52). Regardless of CRD, the risk of cardiovascular events was lower with increasing COVID-19 vaccine dose. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Higher risk of cardiovascular events following COVID-19 might be explained at least in part by the underlying CRD and severity of that condition. In addition, COVID-19 vaccines were beneficial to both people with and without CRD with regards to CV events. <h4>Key Messages</h4> Pre-existing chronic respiratory disease, asthma and COPD severity were associated with a higher risk of various types of cardiovascular outcomes following COVID-19.

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England. <h4>Methods</h4> With the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes. <h4>Results</h4> Amongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar.

Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively. <h4>Conclusion</h4> BNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare.

We compared post-myocardial infarction (MI) mortality by mental disorder, explored whether differences in care contributed to mortality disparities, and investigated whether disparities worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. <h4>Methods</h4>  We identified people with MI in England (November 2019 – February 2023) from the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Programme, ascertaining mental disorder diagnoses from linked electronic health records and mortality from national death records. We used logistic regression to compare 30-day and one-year mortality between people with each of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or depression (of any severity) versus those without these disorders for ST-elevation MI (STEMI) and non-STEMI (NSTEMI), adjusting for confounders and investigating differences by calendar time period. For one-year mortality, we additionally adjusted for receipt of guideline-informed care. <h4>Results</h4>  We included 131,075 patients with NSTEMI and 79,045 with STEMI. For NSTEMI, schizophrenia [odds ratio (OR) 1.73, 95% CI 1.20–2.49] and depression (1.17, 1.08–1.26) were associated with higher 30-day mortality.

We identified mortality disparities for both NSTEMI and STEMI, which were greatest for people with schizophrenia, but also evident for bipolar disorder and depression.

A severe influenza season in 2022-2023 with simultaneous circulation of SARS-CoV2 and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is anticipated. This sub-study aims to determine the incidence and impact of these respiratory viruses on healthcare workers (HCW), the symptoms they experienced, the effectiveness of both COVID-19 and influenza vaccination and the burden of these infections on the National Health Service (NHS) workforce. <h4>Methods and analysis</h4> This is a longitudinal prospective cohort sub-study, utilising the population and infrastructure of SIREN, which focuses on hospital staff in the UK. Participants undergo fortnightly Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing (NAAT) on a multiplex assay including SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A&B and RSV, regardless of symptoms. Questionnaires are completed every two weeks, capturing symptoms, sick days, exposures, and vaccination records. Serum samples are collected monthly or quarterly from participants associated with a SIREN site. This sub-study commenced on 28/11/22 to align with the predicted influenza season and participants’ influenza vaccine status. The SIREN Participant Involvement Panel (PIP) shaped the aims and methods for the study, highlighting its acceptability. UK Devolved Administrations were supported to develop local protocols. Analysis plans include incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic infection, comparisons of vaccination coverage; assessment of sick day burden, and effectiveness of seasonal influenza against infection and time off work. Data are also integrated into UKHSA nosocomial modelling. <h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4> The protocol was approved by the Berkshire Research Ethics Committee (IRAS ID 284460, REC Reference 20SC0230) on 14/11/2022. Participants were informed in advance. As the frequency and method of sampling remained the same, implied consent processes were approved by the committee. Participants returning to the study give informed consent. Regular reports to advisory groups and peer-reviewed publications are planned to disseminate findings and inform decision making. Trial registration number: ISRCTN11041050 . <h4>Strengths and limitations of this study</h4> - The positioning of this sub-study, led by public health agencies in collaboration with a network of NHS sites, facilitates horizon scanning enabling rapid adaptation of the study protocol and deployment to conduct relevant scientific research in a cohort of healthcare workers - To achieve target recruitment, deployment of a new postal pathway is underway, allowing for more direct communication between the central research team and participants - The multi-disciplinary partnerships including a network of academic centres established and embedded by SIREN can now be leveraged and extended to explore ‘Flu and RSV - Decentralised study delivery, with testing at a network of NHS sites has both strengths and limitations. This includes enabling more in-depth relationships and communications between participants and their local research teams, however, introduce additional communication, governance, and data sharing requirements. - Some demographics are over-represented such as female staff, nurses and doctors, and some are under-represented such as staff from ethnic minorities, porters and estates.

The results were similar when using different follow-up start dates, different bandwidths, or when estimating the effect of vaccination (rather than the campaign). <h4>Conclusion</h4> This study found little evidence that the autumn 2022 vaccination campaign in England was associated with a reduction in severe COVID-19-related outcomes among non-clinically vulnerable 50-year-olds. Possible explanations include the low risk of severe outcomes due to substantial pre-existing vaccine- and infection-induced immunity. Modest booster coverage reduced the precision with which we could estimate effectiveness. The booster campaign may have had effects beyond those estimated, including reducing virus transmission and incidence of mild or moderate COVID-19.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/09/08/2023.09.07.23295194.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.07.23295194; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR721547; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR721547&type=FILE&fileName=EMS187659-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We fit Cox regression models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios, overall and by time post-diagnosis and within demographic subgroups. <h4>Results</h4> We identified 365,421, 1,206,555 and 1,321,313 people with evidence of COVID-19 in 2020, 2021 and 2022. The fit note rate was 4.88 per 100 person-months (95%CI 4.83-4.93) in 2020, 2.66 (95%CI 2.64-2.67) in 2021, and 1.73 (95%CI 1.72-1.73) in 2022. Compared with the age, sex and region matched general population, the hazard ratio (HR) adjusted for demographics and clinical characteristics over the follow-up period was 4.07 (95%CI 4.02-4.12) in 2020 decreasing to 1.57 (95%CI 1.56-1.58) in 2022. The HR was highest in the first 30 days post-diagnosis in all years. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Despite likely underestimation of the fit note rate, we identified a considerable increase among people with COVID-19, even in an era when most people are vaccinated. Most fit notes are associated with the acute phase of the disease, but the increased risk several months post-diagnosis provides further evidence of the long-term impact. <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We searched Pubmed from 1 March 2020 to 30 June 2023 using the following search terms: (“COVID-19” OR “SARS-CoV-2” OR “coronavirus”) AND (“United Kingdom” OR “England” OR “Britain” OR “Scotland” OR “Wales”) AND (“fit note” OR “sick note” OR “sick leave” OR “sickness absence”). We also searched the reference list of relevant articles. We included both peer-reviewed research studies and grey literature that quantified receipt of fit notes or sick leave during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found two peer-reviewed studies and one briefing by an independent think tank. A study of 959,356 National Health Service (NHS) employees in England quantified receipt of non-COVID-19 related fit notes during the first wave of the pandemic. They found that the overall fit note rate was lower in 2020 compared with 2019. However, increases in the number of people receiving fit notes were observed for respiratory, infectious disease, and mental health conditions. The second study of 15,931 domiciliary care workers in Wales between Mar 2020 and Nov 2021 found that 15% had been issued a fit note over the study period. Fit notes were more common among women, people ≥45 years, and those with comorbidities. The briefing found that the percentage of sickness absence days taken by NHS employees was higher in 2022 (5.6%) compared with 2019 (4.3%), with a particular increase in absences due to mental health and infectious diseases. In 2022, 18% of sickness absence days were attributable to COVID-19. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> This study is the first to quantify changes in fit note rate since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic among people with a reported SARS-CoV-2 infection and how this compares with the general population in the UK. We found that people with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection had a higher fit note rate than the general population, even after adjusting for demographics and clinical characteristics. While this increased risk was greatest in 2020 (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.07, 95%CI 4.02-4.12), it continued to a lesser extent even into 2022 (HR = 1.57, 95%CI 1.56-1.58). The fit note rate was greatest in the first 30 days post-diagnosis, suggesting that most sick leave is associated with the acute phase. In subgroup analyses, the groups with the greatest relative increased risk changed over the years. People aged 18-24 years had a larger relative increased risk of fit notes (as measured by HR) in 2022 than 2021, when compared with the general population in each year. Additionally, while in 2020 and 2021 the HR increased along with lessening deprivation, this effect dissipated in 2022. In contrast, people hospitalised with COVID-19 were less likely to be issued a fit note than the pneumonia cohort, suggesting the long-term effects may be similar to comparable severe respiratory infections cases resulting in hospitalisation. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> While we have likely underestimated the fit note rate due to overcounting of people in the workforce and misclassification of COVID-19 status, we still identified a substantial increased risk of receiving a fit note in people with COVID-19 compared with the general population over all years, even after adjusting for demographics and a wide range of clinical characteristics. The increased risk persisted into 2022, in an era where most people are vaccinated and the severity of COVID-19 illness is lessened. Given the high infection rates still occurring, these findings provide evidence for a substantial impact of COVID-19 on productivity and further evidence of the long-term impacts of COVID-19.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/09/12/2023.07.28.23293269.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.28.23293269; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR703103; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR703103&type=FILE&fileName=EMS184835-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We aimed to assess the association between time since booster vaccination and characteristics of breakthrough infection. We also assessed whether incident COVID-19 continued to associate with asthma exacerbations in boosted individuals, and whether risk of COVID-19-associated exacerbation was affected by time since vaccination. <h4>Methods</h4> COVIDENCE UK is a prospective, longitudinal, population-based study of COVID-19. We included adult participants who had received ≥1 booster vaccination. Time since vaccination was binarised at 6 months or 12 months according to vaccine eligibility subgroup. We used logistic, Cox, and linear regression to obtain adjusted estimates for the association between time since vaccination and breakthrough infection severity, symptom duration, and acute changes to health-related quality of life (measured by the EQ-5D-3L Index). We then assessed the association of incident COVID-19 with asthma exacerbations using multilevel mixed models, by time since vaccination. <h4>Results</h4> 7391 boosted participants reported a breakthrough infection. Across all eligibility subgroups, greater time since vaccination associated with increased odds of infection requiring bedrest ( vs milder symptoms), with the highest odds for adults aged 65–75 years (1.83 [95% CI 1.51–2.23] when vaccinated >6 months vs ≤6 months prior). However, we observed little evidence of association between time since vaccination and symptom duration. Vaccination >12 months prior ( vs ≤12 months) was associated with a small decrease in EQ-5D-3L Index among participants younger than 65 years (-0.03 points [-0.04 to -0.01]). Among 2100 participants with asthma, incident COVID-19 associated with increased risk of asthma exacerbation, both ≤12 months after vaccination (OR 5.31 [4.36–6.48]) and later (6.06 [3.23–11.38]), with a greater difference in point estimates when specifically considering severe asthma exacerbations (6.82 [4.88–9.54] for ≤12 months vs 10.06 [3.90–25.92] for >12 months). <h4>Conclusion</h4> Longer time since booster vaccination consistently associates with more severe breakthrough infections, and may potentially increase risk of severe asthma exacerbations.

However, assay performance differs from that of high-throughput laboratory-based assays which can be highly sensitive. We explore LFIA performance under field conditions compared to laboratory-based ELISA and assess the potential of LFIAs to identify people who lack functional antibodies following infection or vaccination. <h4>Methods</h4> Field evaluation of a self-administered LFIA test (Fortress, NI) among 3758 participants from the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-2 (REACT-2) study in England selected based on vaccination history and previous LFIA result to ensure a range of antibody titres. In July 2021, participants performed, at home, a self-administered LFIA on finger-prick blood, reported and submitted a photograph of the result, and provided a self-collected capillary blood sample (Tasso-SST) for serological assessment of IgG antibodies to the spike protein using the Roche Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay. We compared the self-administered and reported LFIA result to the quantitative Roche assay and checked the reading of the LFIA result with an automated image analysis (ALFA). In a subsample of 250 participants, we compared the results to live virus neutralisation. <h4>Results</h4> Almost all participants (3593/3758, 95.6%) had been vaccinated or reported prior infection, with most having received one (862, 22.9%) or two (2430, 64.7%) COVID-19 vaccine doses. Overall, 2777/3758 (73.9%) were positive on self-reported LFIA, 2811/3457 (81.3%) positive by LFIA when ALFA-reported, and 3622/3758 (96.4%) positive on Roche anti-S (using the manufacturer reference standard threshold for positivity of 0.8 U ml -1 ). Live virus neutralisation was detected in 169 of 250 randomly selected samples (67.6%); 133/169 were positive with self-reported LFIA (sensitivity 78.7%; 95% CI 71.8, 84.6), 142/155 (91.6%; 86.1, 95.5) with ALFA, and 169 (100%; 97.8, 100.0) with Roche anti-S. There were 81 samples with no detectable virus neutralisation; 47/81 were negative with self-reported LFIA (specificity 58.0%; 95% CI 46.5, 68.9), 34/75 (45.3%; 33.8, 57.3) with ALFA, and 0/81 (0%; 0.0, 4.5) with Roche anti-S. All 250 samples remained positive with Roche anti-S when the threshold was increased to 1000U ml -1 . <h4>Conclusions</h4> Self-administered LFIA can provide insights into population patterns of infection and vaccine response, and sensitivity can be improved with automated reading of the result.

Consequently, many rare conditions lack population-level evidence including prevalence and clinical vulnerability. This has led to the absence of evidence-based care for rare diseases, prominently in the COVID-19 pandemic. <h4>Method</h4> This study used electronic health records (EHRs) of more than 58 million people in England, linking nine National Health Service datasets spanning healthcare settings for people alive on Jan 23, 2020. Starting with all rare diseases listed in Orphanet, we quality assured and filtered down to analyse 331 conditions with ICD-10 or SNOMED-CT mappings clinically validated in our dataset. We report 1) population prevalence, clinical and demographic details of rare diseases, and 2) investigate differences in mortality with SARs-CoV-2. <h4>Findings</h4> Among 58,162,316 individuals, we identified 894,396 with at least one rare disease. Prevalence data in Orphanet originates from various sources with varying degrees of precision. Here we present reproducible age and gender-adjusted estimates for all 331 rare diseases, including first estimates for 186 (56.2%) without any reported prevalence estimate in Orphanet. We identified 49 rare diseases significantly more frequent in females and 62 in males. Similarly we identified 47 rare diseases more frequent in Asian as compared to White ethnicity and 22 with higher Black to white ratios as compared to similar ratios in population controls. 37 rare diseases were overrepresented in the white population as compared to both Black and Asian ethnicities. In total, 7,965 of 894,396 (0.9%) of rare-disease patients died from COVID-19, as compared to 141,287 of 58,162,316 (0.2%) in the full study population. Eight rare diseases had significantly increased risks for COVID-19-related mortality in fully vaccinated individuals, with bullous pemphigoid (8.07[3.01-21.62]) being worst affected. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Our study highlights that National-scale EHRs provide a unique resource to estimate detailed prevalence, clinical and demographic data for rare diseases. Using COVID-19-related mortality analysis, we showed the power of large-scale EHRs in providing insights to inform public health decision-making for these often neglected patient populations. <h4>Funding</h4> British Heart Foundation Data Science Centre, led by Health Data Research UK. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before the study</h4> We have previously published the largest study looking at COVID-19 across rare diseases, but with a sample size of 158 COVID-19 infected rare disease patients and 125 unaffected relatives, from Genomics England, the power of that study was limited. We searched PubMed from database inception to Apr 21, 2023, for publications using the search terms “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2” and “rare disease” or “ORPHANET”, without language restrictions. There are many studies examining the severity of COVID-19 in rare disease patients. However, to date, most studies have focused on a single or a few rare diseases associated with severity of COVID-19, and not taken a comprehensive rare disease wide approach. So far no studies have examined the impact of vaccination on mortality in rare disease patients. Moreover, the sample size used to examine rare diseases is limited in most studies. The largest study we identified included 168,680 individuals but only focused on autoimmune rheumatic disease. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> In this study we use national scale EHR data from England to report age and gender adjusted point prevalence for 331 rare diseases, with clinically-validated ICD-10 and/or SNOMED-CT code lists. Among these, 186 (56.2%) diseases did not have existing point prevalence data available in Orphanet. To our knowledge, this is the first time that rare diseases have been examined on a national scale, encompassing a population of over 58 million people. The large sample size provides sufficient statistical power to detect and describe enough carriers of even very rare conditions <1 case per million. Our analysis of COVID-related mortality has demonstrated the clinical relevance of national data for rare diseases. Specifically, we identified eight rare conditions that are associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality from COVID-19, even among fully vaccinated individuals. <h4>Implication of all the available evidence</h4> These findings provide robust reproducible prevalence, gender, and ethnicity estimates for disease that may often have been under prioritised, and where such information in most cases was not previously available. Our COVID-19 mortality findings highlight the need for targeted policy and support addressing the high level of vulnerability of these patients to COVID-19.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/10/13/2023.10.12.23296948.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.12.23296948; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR741172; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR741172&type=FILE&fileName=EMS189617-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

There is a large burden of long COVID globally from self-reported data, but the epidemiology, causes and treatments remain poorly understood. Primary care is used to help identify and treat patients with long COVID and therefore Electronic Health Records (EHRs) of past COVID-19 patients could be used to help fill these knowledge gaps. We aimed to describe those with long COVID in primary care records in England. <h4>Methods</h4> With the approval of NHS England we used routine clinical data from over 19 million adults in England linked to SARS-COV-2 test result, hospitalisation and vaccination data to describe trends in the recording of 16 clinical codes related to long COVID between November 2020 and January 2023. We calculated rates per 100,000 person-years and plotted how these changed over time. We compared crude and minimally adjusted rates of recorded long COVID in patient records between different key demographic and vaccination characteristics using negative binomial models. <h4>Findings</h4> We identified a total of 55,465 people recorded to have long COVID over the study period, with incidence of new long COVID records increasing steadily over 2021, and declining over 2022.

Among 17,986,419 adults, 36,886 (0.21%) were clinically coded with long COVID. Patient characteristics associated with coded long COVID included female sex, younger age (under 60 years), obesity, living in less deprived areas, ever smoking, greater consultation frequency, and history of diagnosed asthma, mental health conditions, pre-pandemic post-viral fatigue, or psoriasis. The strength of these associations was attenuated following two-dose vaccination compared to before vaccination. The incidence of coded long COVID was higher after hospitalised than non-hospitalised COVID-19. These results should be interpreted with caution given that long COVID was likely under-recorded in electronic health records.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/06/29/2023.06.23.23291776.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.23.23291776; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR683607; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.23.23291776

Many countries have therefore explored the use of wastewater metrics as a surveillance tool, replacing traditional direct measurement of prevalence with cost-effective approaches based on SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater samples. Two important aspects in building prediction models are: time over which the prediction occurs and space for which the predicted case numbers is shown. In this review, our main focus was on finding mathematical models which take into the account both the time-varying and spatial nature of wastewater-based metrics into account. We used six main characteristics as our assessment criteria : i) modelling approach; ii) temporal coverage; iii) spatial coverage; iv) sample size; v) wastewater sampling method; and vi) covariates included in the modelling. The majority of studies in the early phases of the pandemic recognised the temporal association of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration level in wastewater with the number of COVID-19 cases, ignoring their spatial context. Several more recent studies have developed models accounting for spatio-temporal variation in wastewater metrics to predict local community prevalence of COVID-19 infection. The existing models vary in their spatial resolution, which affects their ability to detect local outbreaks. Given that geographical heterogeneity in COVID-19 prevalence has been observed over multiple spatial scales, we conclude that the development, validation and calibration of further spatio-temporally explicit models should be done in parallel with the advancement of wastewater metrics before the potential of wastewater as a surveillance tool can be fully realised.",,doi:https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4539958; doi:https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4539958; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR704086; doi:https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4539958

Evidence regarding effects of COVID-19 vaccination on mental health consequences of COVID-19 is limited. <h4>Methods</h4> With the approval of NHS England, we used linked electronic health records (OpenSAFELY-TPP) to conduct analyses in a ‘pre-vaccination’ cohort (17,619,987 people) followed during the wild-type/Alpha variant eras (January 2020-June 2021), and ‘vaccinated’ and ‘unvaccinated’ cohorts (13,716,225 and 3,130,581 people respectively) during the Delta variant era (June-December 2021). We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) comparing the incidence of mental illness after diagnosis of COVID-19 with the incidence before or without COVID-19. <h4>Outcomes</h4> We considered eight outcomes: depression, serious mental illness, general anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, addiction, self-harm, and suicide. Incidence of most outcomes was elevated during weeks 1-4 after COVID-19 diagnosis, compared with before or without COVID-19, in each cohort. Vaccination mitigated the adverse effects of COVID-19 on mental health: aHRs (95% CIs) for depression and for serious mental illness during weeks 1-4 after COVID-19 were 1.93 (1.88-1.98) and 1.42 (1.24-1.61) respectively in the pre-vaccination cohort and 1.79 (1.68-1.91) and 2.21 (1.99-2.45) respectively in the unvaccinated cohort, compared with 1.16 (1.12-1.20) and 0.91 (0.84-0.98) respectively in the vaccinated cohort. Elevation in incidence was higher, and persisted for longer, after hospitalised than non-hospitalised COVID-19. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Incidence of mental illness is elevated for up to a year following severe COVID-19 in unvaccinated people.

We therefore used prospectively collected monthly data to evaluate how pre-infection sleep characteristics affect risk of long COVID, and to track changes in sleep duration during the year after SARS-CoV-2 infection. <h4>Methods</h4> COVIDENCE UK is a prospective, population-based UK study of COVID-19 in adults. We included non-hospitalised participants with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and estimated odds ratios (ORs) for the association between pre-infection sleep characteristics and long COVID using logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders. We assessed changes in sleep duration after infection using multilevel mixed models. We defined long COVID as unresolved symptoms at least 12 weeks after infection. We defined sleep quality according to age-dependent combinations of sleep duration and efficiency. COVIDENCE UK is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04330599 . <h4>Findings</h4> We included 3994 participants in our long COVID risk analysis, of whom 327 (8.2%) reported long COVID. We found an inverse relationship between pre-infection sleep quality and risk of long COVID (medium vs good quality: OR 1.37 [95% CI 1.04–1.81]; medium–low vs good: 1.55 [1.12–2.16]; low vs good: 1.94 [1.11–3.38]). Greater variability in pre-infection sleep efficiency was also associated with long COVID (OR per percentage-point increase 1.06 [1.01–1.11]). We assessed post-infection sleep duration in 6860 participants, observing a 0.11 h (95% CI 0.08–0.13) increase in the first month after infection compared with pre-infection, with larger increases for more severe infections. After 1 month, sleep duration largely returned to pre-infection levels, although fluctuations in duration lasted up to 6 months after infection among people reporting long COVID. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Our findings highlight the bidirectional relationship between sleep and long COVID. While poor-quality sleep before SARS-CoV-2 infection associates with increased risk of long COVID thereafter, changes in sleep duration after infection in these non-hospitalised cases were modest and generally quick to resolve. <h4>Funding</h4> Barts Charity.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2024/02/08/2024.02.08.24302486.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.08.24302486; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR802874; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR802874&type=FILE&fileName=EMS193995-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

This study addresses the impact of ethnicity in risk prediction modelling for cardiovascular events following SARS-CoV-2 infection and explores the potential of ethnicity-specific models to mitigate disparities. <h4>Methods</h4> This retrospective cohort study utilises six linked datasets accessed through National Health Service (NHS) England’s Secure Data Environment (SDE) service for England, via the BHF Data Science Centre’s CVD-COVID-UK/COVID-IMPACT Consortium. Inclusion criteria were established, and demographic information, risk factors, and ethnicity categories were defined. Four feature selection methods (LASSO, Random Forest, XGBoost, QRISK) were employed and ethnicity-specific prediction models were trained and tested using logistic regression. Discrimination (AUROC) and calibration performance were assessed for different populations and ethnicity groups. <h4>Findings</h4> Several differences were observed in the models trained on the whole study cohort vs ethnicity-specific groups. At the feature selection stage, ethnicity-specific models yielded different selected features. AUROC discrimination measures showed consistent performance across most ethnicity groups, with QRISK-based models performing relatively poorly. Calibration performance exhibited variation across ethnicity groups and age categories. Ethnicity-specific models demonstrated the potential to enhance calibration performance for certain ethnic groups. <h4>Interpretation</h4> This research highlights the importance of considering ethnicity in risk prediction modelling to ensure equitable healthcare outcomes. Differences in selected features and asymmetric calibration across ethnicities underscore the necessity of tailored approaches. Ethnicity-specific models offer a pathway to addressing disparities and improving model performance. The study emphasises the role of data-driven technologies in either alleviating or exacerbating existing health inequalities. <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> Research has suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infections may have prognostic value in predicting later cardiovascular disease outcomes, two diseases where ethnicity-based health inequalities have been observed. Existing health inequalities are at risk of being exacerbated by bias in emerging data-driven technologies such as risk prediction models, and there currently exists no recommended practice to mitigate this issue. Model performances are not typically stratified by ethnic groups and, if reported, ethnic groups are often only included in higher-level categories that have been criticised for simplicity of definition and for missing key ethnic heterogeneity. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> This study demonstrates the impact of including an in-depth consideration of ethnicity and its granularity in risk prediction modelling for cardiovascular event prediction in patients following a SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is one of, if not the first, set of models specifically built for and representative of all ethnic groups across an entire population, evaluating different practices to best mitigate ethnicity-based disparities in prediction algorithms. Moreover, ethnicity data has historically not been well captured, with as many as 1 in 3 individuals missing ethnicity data in their health records. With data linkage, this work is the first to analyse 96% complete ethnicity records in one of the world’s largest ethnically diverse routinely collected datasets. <h4>Implications of all of the available evidence</h4> This study highlights the potential of tailoring feature selection, performance measures, and probability scores to different ethnic groups through ethnicity-specific risk prediction models to mitigate prediction bias. We identify differences between models trained on the global study populations to cohorts of specific ethnicities, and encourage the use of more granular ethnicity categories to capture the diversity of underlying populations. Such approaches will allow for newly developed data-driven tools to cater to the ethnic heterogeneity present between populations and ensure that emerging technologies translate into equitable health outcomes for everyone.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/09/14/2023.09.13.23295489.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.13.23295489; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR724715; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR724715&type=FILE&fileName=EMS188004-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

A unique feature is the capacity to support trial-within-cohort studies to evaluate interventions for prevention of COVID-19 and other acute respiratory illnesses. Participants complete a detailed online baseline questionnaire capturing self-reported information relating to their socio-demographic characteristics, occupation, lifestyle, quality of life, weight, height, longstanding medical conditions, medication use, vaccination status, diet and supplemental micronutrient intake. Follow-up on-line questionnaires capturing incident symptoms of COVID-19 and other acute respiratory infections, incident swab test-confirmed COVID-19, doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine received, and quality of life are completed at monthly intervals. <h4>Results</h4> The study was launched on 1 st May 2020 and closed to recruitment on 6 th October 2021. A total of 19,981 participants enrolled and consented to 5-year follow-up with medical record linkage. Their mean age was 59.1 years (range 16.0 to 94.4 years), 70.2% were female, and 93.7% identified their ethnic origin as White. Analyses conducted to date have provided key insights into risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease, determinants of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy, and impacts of COVID-19 on health economic outcomes. The cohort has also supported conduct of a Phase 3 randomised trial-within-cohort study (CORONAVIT) evaluating implementation of a test-and-treat approach to correcting sub-optimal vitamin D status on incidence and severity of acute respiratory infections, including COVID-19. <h4>Conclusions</h4> The COVIDENCE UK dataset represents a valuable resource containing granular information on factors influencing susceptibility to, and impacts of, COVID-19 in UK adults.

These medications have been postulated to influence susceptibility to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The objective of this study was to assess a possible association between prescription of RAS inhibitors and the incidence of COVID-19 and all-cause mortality. <h4>Methods</h4> We conducted a propensity-score matched cohort study to assess the incidence of COVID-19 among patients with hypertension who were prescribed ACE inhibitors or ARBs compared to patients treated with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in a large UK-based primary care database (The Health Improvement Network). We estimated crude incidence rates for confirmed/suspected COVID-19 among those prescribed ACE inhibitors, ARBs and CCBs. We used a Cox proportional hazards model to produce adjusted hazard ratios for COVID-19 comparing patients prescribed ACE inhibitors or ARBs to those prescribed CCBs. We further assessed all-cause mortality as a secondary outcome and a composite of accidents, trauma or fractures as a negative control outcome to assess for residual confounding. <h4>Results</h4> In the propensity score matched analysis, 83 of 18,895 users (0.44%) of ACE inhibitors developed COVID-19 over 8,923 person-years, an incidence rate of 9.3 per 1000 person-years. 85 of 18,895 (0.45%) users of CCBs developed COVID-19 over 8,932 person-years, an incidence rate of 9.5 per 1000 person-years. The adjusted hazard ratio for suspected/confirmed COVID-19 for users of ACE inhibitors compared to CCBs was 0.92 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.26). 79 out of 10,623 users (0.74%) of ARBs developed COVID-19 over 5010 person-years, an incidence rate of 15.8 per 1000 person-years, compared to 11.6 per 1000 person-years among users of CCBs. The adjusted hazard ratio for suspected/confirmed COVID-19 for users of ARBs compared to CCBs was 1.38 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.95). There were no significant associations between use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs and all-cause mortality, compared to use of CCBs. We found no evidence of significant residual confounding with the negative control analysis. <h4>Conclusion</h4> Current use of ACE inhibitors was not associated with the risk of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 whereas use of ARBs was associated with a statistically non-significant 38% relative increase in risk compared to use of CCBs. However, no significant associations were observed between prescription of either ACE inhibitors or ARBs and all-cause mortality during the peak of the pandemic.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/09/18/2020.09.17.20196469.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.17.20196469; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR215604; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR215604&type=FILE&fileName=EMS96164-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir were assessed in separate comparisons in RECOVERY, both of which are reported here. Eligible and consenting adults could join the molnupiravir comparison, the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison, or both. For each comparison, participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the relevant antiviral (five days of molnupiravir 800mg twice daily or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir 300mg/100mg twice daily) or to usual care without the relevant antiviral drug, using web-based unstratified randomisation with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and secondary outcomes were time to discharge alive from hospital, and among those not on invasive ventilation at baseline, progression to invasive ventilation or death. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Both comparisons were stopped by the investigators because of low recruitment. ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT04381936 ). <h4>Findings</h4> From 24 January 2022 to 24 May 2023, 923 patients were recruited to the molnupiravir comparison (445 allocated molnupiravir and 478 allocated usual care), and from 31 March 2022 to 24 May 2023, 137 patients were recruited to the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison (68 allocated nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 69 allocated usual care). More than three-quarters of the patients in both comparisons were vaccinated and had anti-spike antibodies at randomisation, and more than two-thirds were receiving other SARS-CoV-2 antivirals (including remdesivir or sotrovimab). In the molnupiravir comparison, 74 (17%) patients allocated to molnupiravir and 79 (17%) patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (hazard ratio [HR] 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-1.28; p=0.66). In the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison, 13 (19%) patients allocated nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 13 (19%) patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.47-2.23; p=0.96). In neither comparison was there evidence of a significant difference in the duration of hospitalisation or the proportion of patients progressing to invasive ventilation or death. <h4>Interpretation</h4> In adults hospitalised with COVID-19, neither molnupiravir nor nirmatrelvir-ritonavir were associated with reductions in 28-day mortality, duration of hospital stay, or risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death although these comparisons had limited statistical power due to low recruitment. <h4>Funding</h4> UK Research and Innovation (Medical Research Council) and National Institute of Health and Care Research (Grant ref: MC_PC_19056), and Wellcome Trust (Grant Ref: 222406/Z/20/Z). <h4>Trial registration</h4> ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04381936 https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04381936 ISRCTN50189673 http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN50189673",,doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.23.24307731; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.23.24307731; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR858381; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR858381&type=FILE&fileName=EMS196562-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Although mortality rates have been high in LTCF residents there is little information regarding the features of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity after infection in this setting or how this may influence immunity to other infections. We studied humoral and cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in 152 LTCF staff and 124 residents over a prospective 4-month period shortly after the first wave of infection and related viral serostatus to heterologous immunity to other respiratory viruses and systemic inflammatory markers. LTCF residents developed high levels of antibodies against spike protein and RBD domain which were stable over 4 months of follow up. Nucleocapsid-specific responses were also elevated in elderly donors but showed waning across all populations. Antibodies showed stable and equivalent levels of functional inhibition against spike-ACE2 binding in all age groups with comparable activity against viral variants of concern. SARS-CoV-2 seropositive donors showed high levels of antibodies to other beta-coronaviruses but serostatus did not impact humoral immunity to influenza or RSV. SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular responses were equivalent across the life course but virus-specific populations showed elevated levels of activation in older donors. LTCF residents who are survivors of SARS-CoV-2 infection thus show robust and stable immunity which does not impact responses to other seasonal viruses. These findings augur well for relative protection of LTCF residents to re-infection. Furthermore, they underlie the potent influence of previous infection on the immune response to Covid-19 vaccine which may prove to be an important determinant of future vaccine strategy. <h4>One sentence summery</h4> Care home residents show waning of nucleocapsid specific antibodies and enhanced expression of activation markers on SARS-CoV-2 specific cells",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/08/18/2021.08.13.21261889.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.13.21261889; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR384241; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR384241&type=FILE&fileName=EMS133205-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Primary care-based preconception interventions can reduce preconception risk factors but require engagement. We explored whether women interact with general practice (GP) and accident and emergency (A&E) in the year pre-pregnancy, differences between interpreter-users and non-interpreter-users, and changes over the COVID-19 pandemic. <h4>Methods</h4>  English population-wide linked data including primary, secondary and maternity-care were used. Participants included women with estimated pregnancy start dates 1/3/2019-29/2/2024, aged 18-49. Outcome measures were interactions with GP and A&E in the year pre-pregnancy (yes/no) according to interpreter-use. Outcomes were recorded according to pregnancy start date: 1/3/2019-29/2/2020 (pre-pregnancy-year pre-COVID-19-onset), 1/3/2020-28/2/2021 (pre-pregnancy-year overlapping with COVID-19-onset) or 1/3/2020-29/2/2024 (pre-pregnancy-year after COVID-19-onset). Logistic regression compared GP/A&E interaction pre-pregnancy among interpreter-users versus non-interpreter-users. <h4>Results</h4>  Among 2,182,280 women, 61,140 (2.8%) used interpreters. Median age was 31.0 among interpreter-users and 30.9 among non-interpreter-users. 49.7% (n=30,370) of interpreter-users were in the most deprived quintile versus 22.7% (n=480,470) of non-interpreter-users, and 62.5% (n=38,150) were of ethnic minorities (excluding white minorities) versus 22.1% (n=468,530) of non-interpreter-users. 79.5% (n=48,625) of interpreter-users interacted with GP in the year pre-pregnancy, versus 85.0% (n=1,802,925) of non-interpreter-users. Interpreter-use was associated with lower adjusted odds (aOR) of GP interaction, including among women whose pre-pregnancy-ear was pre-COVID-19-onset (aOR 0.92 [95%CI 0.88-0.96]), overlapped with COVID-19-onset (aOR 0.76 [95%CI 0.73-0.79]) and post-COVID-19-onset (aOR 0.63 [95%CI 0.61-0.65]). Adjusted odds of A&E interaction in the year pre-pregnancy were 0.96 (95%CI 0.95-0.98) lower among interpreter-users. Odds of A&E interactions did not change substantially during COVID-19. <h4>Conclusions</h4>  GP interactions may improve preconception health. Ensuring interpreter-need is recorded at GP registration is important to ensure communication in appropriate languages. Widening inequalities in GP interactions suggest a proactive approach may be required. <h4>Key Messages</h4>  Non-English-speaking women face healthcare barriers, and primary care-based preconception interventions can reduce preconception risk factors. However, previously, we did not know whether women using interpreters interact with GP or A&E differently from non-interpreter-users, and whether and how interactions with GP/A&E pre-pregnancy have changed since COVID-19. This research shows that most women interact with the GP at some point in the year pre-pregnancy, but fewer interpreter-users do so, and inequalities have increased since COVID-19 suggesting a more proactive approach to preconception health may be needed for this group. Most women do not interact with A&E in the year before getting pregnant. Therefore, clinicians in primary care are ideally placed to offer preconception health interventions but targeted interventions in multiple languages may be needed outside GP for those not accessing GP care before they get pregnant.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2025/07/03/2025.07.03.25330826.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.07.03.25330826; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR1046347; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR1046347&type=FILE&fileName=EMS206855-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

All people aged 75 years or over and the clinically vulnerable were eligible to receive a booster dose. Direct comparisons of the effectiveness of these two vaccines in boosting protection against severe COVID-19 events have not been made in trials or observational data. <h4>Methods</h4> With the approval of NHS England, we used the OpenSAFELY-TPP database to compare effectiveness of the Pfizer BA.4-5 and Sanofi vaccines during the spring 2023 booster programme, between 1 April and 30 June 2023. We investigated two cohorts separately: those aged 75 or over (75+); and those aged 50 or over and clinically vulnerable (CV). In each cohort, vaccine recipients were matched on date of vaccination, COVID-19 vaccine history, age, and other characteristics. Effectiveness outcomes were COVID-19 hospital admission, COVID-19 critical care admission, and COVID-19 death up to 16 weeks after vaccination. Safety outcomes were pericarditis and myocarditis up to 4 weeks after vaccination. We report the cumulative incidence of each outcome, and compare safety and effectiveness using risk differences (RD), relative risks (RR), and incidence rate ratios (IRRs). <h4>Results</h4> 492,642 people were 1-1 matched in the CV cohort, and 673,926 in the 75+ cohort, contributing a total of 7,423,251 and 10,173,230 person-weeks of follow-up, respectively.

Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for calendar time of infection and sociodemographic factors related to vaccine uptake and risk of severe COVID-19, were used to estimate VE as the complement of the hazard ratio for COVID-19 hospital admission. <h4>Results</h4> Compared with unvaccinated pregnant women, the adjusted rate of COVID-19 hospital admission was 76% (95% confidence interval 69% to 82%) lower for single-vaccinated pregnant women and 83% (75% to 88%) lower for double-vaccinated pregnant women.

Among those vaccinated more than 90 days before infection, being double-vaccinated was associated with a greater reduction in risk than being single-vaccinated. <h4>Conclusions</h4> COVID-19 vaccination is associated with reduced rates of severe illness in pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the reduction in risk is similar to that for non-pregnant women. Waning of vaccine effectiveness occurs more quickly after one dose of a vaccine than two doses. <h4>What is already known on this topic</h4> Being pregnant is a risk factor for severe illness and mortality following infection with SARS-CoV-2. Existing evidence suggests that COVID-19 vaccines are effective for preventing severe outcomes in pregnant women. However, research directly comparing vaccine effectiveness between pregnant and non-pregnant women of reproductive age at the population level are lacking. <h4>What this study adds</h4> Our study provides real-world evidence that COVID-19 vaccination reduces the risk of hospital admission by a similar amount for both women infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and women who were not pregnant when infected, during the Alpha and Delta dominant periods in England.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/09/27/2022.09.27.22280397.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.09.27.22280397; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR550732; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR550732&type=FILE&fileName=EMS155049-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Old age is the strongest factor associated with increased COVID19-related mortality, followed by sex and pre-existing conditions. The importance of genetic and immunological factors on COVID19 outcome is also starting to emerge, as demonstrated by population studies and the discovery of damaging variants in genes controlling type I IFN immunity and of autoantibodies that neutralize type I IFNs. The human protein transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2) plays a key role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it is required to activate the virus’ spike protein, facilitating entry into target cells. We focused on the only common TMPRSS2 non-synonymous variant predicted to be damaging (rs12329760), which has a minor allele frequency of ∼25% in the population. In a large population of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, we show that this variant is associated with a reduced likelihood of developing severe COVID19 (OR 0.87, 95%CI:0.79-0.97, p=0.01). This association was stronger in homozygous individuals when compared to the general population (OR 0.65, 95%CI:0.50-0.84, p=1.3×10 −3 ). We demonstrate in vitro that this variant, which causes the amino acid substitution valine to methionine, impacts the catalytic activity of TMPRSS2 and is less able to support SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated entry into cells. TMPRSS2 rs12329760 is a common variant associated with a significantly decreased risk of severe COVID19. Further studies are needed to assess the expression of the TMPRSS2 across different age groups. Moreover, our results identify TMPRSS2 as a promising drug target, with a potential role for camostat mesilate, a drug approved for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis and postoperative reflux esophagitis, in the treatment of COVID19.

In order to effectively target government responses, it is critical to identify the individuals most at risk of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), developing severe clinical signs, and mortality. We undertook a systematic review of the literature, to present the current status of scientific knowledge in these areas and describe the need for unified global approaches, moving forwards, as well as lessons learnt for future pandemics. <h4>Methods: </h4> Medline, Embase and Global Health were searched to the end of April 2020, as well as the Web of Science. Search terms were specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19. Comparative studies of risk factors from any setting, population group and in any language were included. Titles, abstracts and full texts were screened by two reviewers and extracted in duplicate into a standardised form. Data were extracted on risk factors for COVID-19 disease, severe disease, or death and were narratively and descriptively synthesised. <h4>Results: </h4> 1,238 papers were identified post-deduplication. 33 met our inclusion criteria, of which 26 were from China. Six assessed the risk of contracting the disease, 20 the risk of having severe disease and ten the risk of dying. Age, gender and co-morbidities were commonly assessed as risk factors. The weight of evidence showed increasing age to be associated with severe disease and mortality, and general comorbidities with mortality. Only seven studies presented multivariable analyses and power was generally limited. A wide range of definitions were used for disease severity. <h4>Conclusions: </h4> The volume of literature generated in the short time since the appearance of SARS-CoV-2 has been considerable. Many studies have sought to document the risk factors for COVID-19 disease, disease severity and mortality; age was the only risk factor based on robust studies and with a consistent body of evidence. Mechanistic studies are required to understand why age is such an important risk factor.

Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) due to other pathogens may cause long-term symptoms, but few studies compare post-acute sequelae between SARS-CoV-2 and other ARIs. We aimed to compare symptom profiles between people with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, people with previous non-COVID-19 ARIs, and contemporaneous controls, and to identify clusters of long-term symptoms. <h4>Methods</h4> COVIDENCE UK is a prospective, population-based UK study of ARIs in adults. We analysed data on 16 potential long COVID symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), reported in January, 2021, by participants unvaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. We classified participants as having previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or previous non-COVID-19 ARI (≥4 weeks prior) or no reported ARI. We compared symptoms by infection status using logistic and fractional regression, and identified symptom clusters using latent class analysis (LCA). <h4>Findings</h4> We included 10,203 participants (1343 [13.2%] with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 472 [4.6%] with non-COVID-19 ARI). Both types of infection were associated with increased prevalence/severity of most symptoms and decreased HRQoL compared with no infection. Participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection had increased odds of taste/smell problems and hair loss compared with participants with non-COVID-19 ARIs. Separate LCA models identified three symptom severity groups for each infection type. In the most severe groups (including 23% of participants with SARS-CoV-2, and 21% with non-COVID-19 ARI), SARS-CoV-2 infection presented with a higher probability of memory problems, difficulty concentrating, hair loss, and taste/smell problems than non-COVID-19 ARI. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Both SARS-CoV-2 and non-COVID-19 ARIs are associated with a wide range of long-term symptoms. Research on post-acute sequelae of ARIs should extend from SARS-CoV-2 to include other pathogens. <h4>Funding</h4> Barts Charity. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for studies on post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 and other acute respiratory infections (ARIs), published up to May 24, 2023. We used search terms relating to COVID-19 and other ARIs (“COVID-19”, “SARS”, “severe acute respiratory syndrome”, “Middle East respiratory”, “MERS”, “respiratory infection”, “influenza”, “flu”) and post-acute symptoms (“long COVID”, “post-acute”, “PACS”, “sequelae”, “long-term”). Previous studies have shown a wide range of post-acute sequelae for COVID-19, affecting people with all severities of the acute disease. The few studies that have compared long-term symptoms between people with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARIs have generally found a higher symptom burden among people with COVID-19; however, these studies have been restricted to hospitalised patients or electronic health record data, and thus do not capture the full picture in the community. Research into long COVID phenotypes has been inconclusive, with some analyses classifying people with long COVID according to the types of symptoms experienced, and others classifying them according to the overall severity of their symptoms. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> In this population-based study of ARIs in the community, we observed high symptom burden among people with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection when compared with controls, highlighting the extensive reach of long COVID. Our finding of a similar symptom burden among people with non-COVID-19 ARIs suggests that post-acute sequelae of other ARIs may be going unrecognised, particularly given that the vast majority did not experience a severe acute infection. Latent class analyses of symptoms identified groupings based on overall symptom severity, rather than symptom types, for both SARS-CoV-2 infections and non-COVID-19 ARIs, suggesting that overall symptom burden may best characterise the experience of people with post-acute sequelae. Notably, among participants with the most severe symptoms, only half of those with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection attributed their symptoms to long COVID, suggesting they either did not believe the infection was the cause, or they did not consider their symptoms severe enough to qualify as long COVID. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> The long-term symptoms experienced by some people with previous ARIs, including SARS-CoV-2, highlights the need for improved understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of post-acute infection syndromes. As much-needed research into long COVID continues, we must take the opportunity to investigate and consider the post-acute burden of ARIs due to other pathogens.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/07/07/2023.07.06.23292296.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.06.23292296; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR687749; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR687749&type=FILE&fileName=EMS178685-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Our aim is to identify the barriers to methods reproducibility for replication studies using EHR data. <h4>Methods</h4> We replicated a study that examined the risk of hospitalisation following a positive COVID-19 test in individuals with diabetes. Using EHR data from the NHS England’s Secure Data Environment (SDE) covering the whole of England, UK (population 57m), we sought to replicate findings from the original study, which used data from Greater Manchester (a large urban region in the UK, population 2.9m). Both analyses were conducted in Trusted Research Environments (TREs) or SDEs, containing linked primary and secondary care data, however methods reproducibility was not straightforward. Differences between the environments that contributed to the difficulties were documented, categorized into themes, and converted into a list of recommendations for TRE/SDEs. <h4>Results</h4> Small differences between the environments and the data sources led to several challenges in methods reproducibility. Our recommendations of TRE/SDEs should facilitate future replication studies. The recommendations include: a need for improved machine-readable metadata for EHR data; standardization of governance processes to facilitate federated analysis; mandating of code sharing; and for environments to have a support structure for data engineers and analysts. We also propose a new theme for research, “data reproducibility”, as the ability to prepare, extract and clean data from a different database for a replication study. <h4>Conclusion</h4> Even with perfect code sharing, data reproducibility remains a challenge. Our recommendations have the potential to reduce the barriers to replication studies and therefore enhance the potential of observational studies using EHR data.",,doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.06.24311535; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.06.24311535; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR891169; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR891169&type=FILE&fileName=EMS197985-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

However, the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in people with obesity is unknown. Here we studied the relationship between body mass index (BMI), hospitalization and mortality due to Covid-19 amongst 3.5 million people in Scotland. Vaccinated people with severe obesity (BMI>40 kg/m  2 ) were significantly more likely to experience hospitalization or death from Covid-19. Excess risk increased with time since vaccination. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we conducted a prospective longitudinal study of the immune response in a clinical cohort of vaccinated people with severe obesity. Compared with normal weight people, six months after their second vaccine dose, significantly more people with severe obesity had unquantifiable titres of neutralizing antibody against authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus, reduced frequencies of antigen-experienced SARS-CoV-2 Spike-binding B cells, and a dissociation between anti-Spike antibody levels and neutralizing capacity. Neutralizing capacity was restored by a third dose of vaccine, but again declined more rapidly in people with severe obesity. We demonstrate that waning of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced humoral immunity is accelerated in people with severe obesity and associated with increased hospitalization and mortality from breakthrough infections. Given the prevalence of obesity, our findings have significant implications for global public health.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/06/14/2022.06.09.22276196.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.09.22276196; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR506156; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.09.22276196

It is unknown how infliximab impacts vaccine-induced serological responses against highly transmissible Omicron variants, which possess the ability to evade host immunity and are now the dominating variants causing current waves of infection.<br><br>Methods: CLARITY IBD is a prospective, multicentre, observational cohort study investigating the impact of infliximab and vedolizumab, a gut-specific anti-integrin monoclonal antibody, on SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The primary outcome was neutralising antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 ancestral and Omicron BA.1 and BA.4/5 variants after three doses of COVID-19 vaccination in 1288 patients with IBD without prior COVID-19 infection, who were established on either infliximab (n=871) or vedolizumab (417). Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to investigate the risk of breakthrough infection in relation to neutralising antibody titres.<br><br>Findings: Following three doses of COVID-19 vaccine, neutralising antibody NT50 (half-inhibitory neutralising titre) was significantly diminished in patients treated with infliximab as compared to patients treated with vedolizumab, against ancestral (geometric mean [95% CI], 1990 [1781 to 2223] vs 3212 [2780 to 3712], p<0·0001), BA.1 (95·46 [82·80 to 110·0] vs 599·1 [492·6 to 728·6], p<0·0001) and BA.4/5 (30·73 [26·26 to 35·96] vs 212·2 [177·0 to 254·4], p<0·0001) variants.

The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study estimated swab positivity in England approximately monthly from May 2020 to 31 March 2022. This period covers widespread circulation of the original strain, the emergence of the Alpha, Delta and Omicron variants and the rollout of England’s mass vaccination campaign. <h4>Methods</h4> Here, we explore this changing relationship between prevalence of swab positivity and the infection fatality rate (IFR) and infection hospitalisation rate (IHR) over 23 months of the pandemic in England, using publicly available data for the daily number of deaths and hospitalisations, REACT-1 swab positivity data, time-delay models and Bayesian P-spline models. We analyse data for all age groups together, as well as in two sub-groups: those aged 65 and over and those aged 64 and under. <h4>Results</h4> During 2020, we estimated the IFR to be 0.67% and the IHR to be 2.6%. By late-2021/early-2022 the IFR and IHR had both decreased to 0.097% and 0.76% respectively. Continuous estimates of the IFR and IHR of the virus were observed to increase during the periods of Alpha and Delta’s emergence. During periods of vaccination rollout, and the emergence of the Omicron variant, the IFR and IHR of the virus decreased. During 2020, we estimated a time-lag of 19 days between hospitalisation and swab positivity, and 26 days between deaths and swab positivity. By late-2021/early-2022 these time-lags had decreased to 7 days for hospitalisations, and 18 days for deaths. <h4>Conclusion</h4> Even though many populations have high levels of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 from vaccination and natural infection, waning of immunity and variant emergence will continue to be an upwards pressure on IHR and IFR. As investments in community surveillance are scaled back, alternative methods should be developed to accurately track the ever changing relationship between infection, hospitalisation and death.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/10/13/2022.10.12.22281016.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.12.22281016; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR557473; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR557473&type=FILE&fileName=EMS155665-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

The impact of vaccination on this increase, for how long it persists, and the effect of COVID-19 on other types of diabetes remain unclear. <h4>Methods</h4> With NHS England approval, we studied diabetes incidence following COVID-19 diagnosis in pre-vaccination (N=15,211,471, January 2020-December 2021), vaccinated (N =11,822,640), and unvaccinated (N=2,851,183) cohorts (June-December 2021), using linked electronic health records. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) comparing diabetes incidence post-COVID-19 diagnosis with incidence before or without diagnosis up to 102 weeks post-diagnosis. Results were stratified by COVID-19 severity (hospitalised/non-hospitalised) and diabetes type. <h4>Findings</h4> In the pre-vaccination cohort, aHRS for T2DM incidence after COVID-19 (compared to before or without diagnosis) declined from 3.01 (95% CI: 2.76,3.28) in weeks 1-4 to 1.24 (1.12,1.38) in weeks 53-102. aHRS were higher in unvaccinated than vaccinated people (4.86 (3.69,6.41)) versus 1.42 (1.24,1.62) in weeks 1-4) and for hospitalised COVID-19 (pre-vaccination cohort 21.1 (18.8,23.7) in weeks 1-4 declining to 2.04 (1.65,2.51) in weeks 52-102), than non-hospitalised COVID-19 (1.45 (1.27,1.64) in weeks 1-4, 1.10 (0.98,1.23) in weeks 52-102). T2DM persisted for 4 months after COVID-19 for ∼73% of those diagnosed. Patterns were similar for Type 1 diabetes, though excess incidence did not persist beyond a year post-COVID-19. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Elevated T2DM incidence after COVID-19 is greater, and persists longer, in hospitalised than non-hospitalised people. It is markedly less apparent post-vaccination. Testing for T2DM after severe COVID-19 and promotion of vaccination are important tools in addressing this public health problem. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We searched PubMed for population-based observational studies published between December 1st 2019 and July 12th 2023 examining associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 diagnosis (search string: SARS-CoV-2 or COVID* or coronavirus*) and subsequent incident diabetes (search term: diabetes). Of nineteen relevant studies; eight had a composite outcome of diabetes types, six stratified by diabetes type and five pertained to type-1-diabetes (T1DM) only. We did not identify any studies relating to gestational or other types of diabetes. Eleven studies were from the US, three from the UK, two from Germany, one from Canada, one from Denmark and one from South Korea. Most studies described cumulative relative risks (for infection versus no infection) one to two years post-SARS-CoV-2 infection of 1.2 to 2.6, though four studies found no associations with T1DM after the post-acute period. All studies lacked the power to compare diabetes relative risk by type, severity, and vaccination status in population subgroups. One study examined relative risks by vaccination status, but this used a composite outcome of diabetes and hyperlipidaemia and was conducted in a predominantly white male population. Two studies of T1DM found no evidence of elevated risk beyond 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, whilst two reported elevated risks at six months. Two studies of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) examined relative risks by time period post-infection: one study of US insurance claims reported a persistent association six months post-infection, whereas a large UK population-based study reported no associations after 12 weeks. However, the latter study used only primary care data, therefore COVID-19 cases were likely to have been under-ascertained. No large studies have investigated the persistence of diabetes diagnosed following COVID-19; key to elucidating the role of stress/steroid-induced hyperglycaemia. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> This study, which is the largest to address the question to date, analysed linked primary and secondary care health records with SARS-CoV-2 testing and COVID-19 vaccination data for 15 million people living in England. This enabled us to compare the elevation in diabetes incidence after COVID-19 diagnosis by diabetes type, COVID-19 severity and vaccination status, overall and in population subgroups. Importantly, excess diabetes incidence by time period since infection could also be quantified. Since healthcare in the UK is universal and free-at-the-point-of-delivery, almost the entire population is registered with primary care. Therefore the findings are likely to be generalisable. We found that, before availability of COVID-19 vaccination, a COVID-19 diagnosis (vs. no diagnosis) was associated with increased T2DM incidence which remained elevated by approximately 30% beyond one year after diagnosis. Though still present (with around 30% excess incidence at eight weeks), these associations were substantially attenuated in unvaccinated compared with vaccinated people. Excess incidence was greater in people hospitalised with COVID-19 than those who were not hospitalised after diagnosis. T1DM incidence was elevated up to, but not beyond, a year post COVID-19. Around 73% of people diagnosed with incident T2DM after COVID-19 still had evidence of diabetes four months after infection. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> There is a 30-50% elevated T2DM incidence post-COVID-19, but we report the novel finding that there is elevated incidence beyond one-year post-diagnosis. Elevated T1DM incidence did not appear to persist beyond a year, which may explain why previous studies disagree. For the first time in a general-population dataset, we demonstrate that COVID-19 vaccination reduces, but does not entirely ameliorate, excess diabetes incidence after COVID-19. This supports a policy of universal vaccination and suggests that other public health activities, such as enhanced diabetes screening after severe COVID-19, may be warranted, particularly in unvaccinated people.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/08/09/2023.08.07.23293778.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.08.07.23293778; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR706917; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.08.07.23293778

To determine what the pre-pandemic distribution of immunity to HCoVs was, we fitted a mathematical model to 6 years of seasonal coronavirus surveillance data from England and Wales. We estimated a duration of immunity to seasonal HCoVs of 7.3 years (95%CI 6.8 - 7.9) and show that, while cross-protection between HCoV and SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the age distribution, it is insufficient to explain the age pattern of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the first wave of the pandemic in England and Wales. Projections from our model illustrate how different strengths of cross-protection between circulating coronaviruses could determine the frequency and magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics over the coming decade, as well as the potential impact of cross-protection on future seasonal coronavirus transmission. <h4>Significance statement:</h4> Cross-protection from seasonal epidemics of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) has been hypothesised to contribute to the relative sparing of children during the early phase of the pandemic. Testing this relies on understanding the pre-pandemic age-distribution of recent HCoV infections, but little is known about their dynamics.

Primary vaccination provides strong short-term protection, but data are limited on duration of protection following booster vaccines, particularly against the Omicron variant. We investigated effectiveness of booster vaccination against infections, hospitalisations and deaths among LTCF residents and staff in England. <h4>Methods</h4> We included residents and staff of LTCFs within the VIVALDI study ( ISRCTN 14447421 ) who underwent routine, asymptomatic testing (December 12 2021-March 31 2022). Cox regression was used to estimate relative hazards of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and associated hospitalisation and death at 0-13, 14-48, 49-83 and 84 days after dose 3 of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination compared to 2 doses (after 84+ days), stratified by previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and adjusting for age, sex, LTCF capacity and local SARS-CoV-2 incidence. <h4>Results</h4> 14175 residents and 19973 staff were included. In residents without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, infection risk was reduced 0-83 days after first booster, but no protection was apparent after 84 days. Additional protection following booster vaccination waned, but was still present at 84+ days for COVID-associated hospitalisation (aHR: 0.47, 0.24-0.89) and death (aHR: 0.37, 0.21-0.62). Most residents (64.4%) had received primary course of AstraZeneca, but this did not impact on pre- or post-booster risks. Staff showed a similar pattern of waning booster effectiveness against infection, with few hospitalisations and no deaths. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Booster vaccination provides sustained protection against severe outcomes following infection with the Omicron variant, but no protection against infection from 3 months onwards. Ongoing surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in LTCFs is crucial. <h4>Summary</h4> The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted residents in long-term care facilities (LTCFs).

It has instigated the mobilisation of resources into the development of control tools, such as diagnostics and vaccines. The poor performance of some diagnostic serological tools has emphasised the need for up to date immune-informatic analyses to inform the selection of viable targets for further study. This requires the integration and analysis of genetic and immunological data for SARS-CoV-2 and its homology with other human coronavirus species to understand cross-reactivity. <h4>Methods</h4> We have developed an online “immuno-analytics” resource to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 research, combining an extensive B/T-cell epitope mapping and prediction meta-analysis, and human CoV sequence homology mapping and protein database annotation, with an updated variant database and geospatial tracking for >7,800 non-synonymous mutation positions derived from >150,000 whole genome sequences. To demonstrate its utility, we present an integrated analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins, both being vaccine and serological diagnostic targets, including an analysis of changes in relevant mutation frequencies over time. <h4>Results</h4> Our analysis reveals that the nucleocapsid protein in its native form appears to be a sub-optimal target for use in serological diagnostic platforms. The most frequent mutations were the spike protein D614G and nsp12 L314P, which were common (>86%) across all the geographical regions. Some mutations in the spike protein (e.g. A222V and L18F) have increased in frequency in Europe during the latter half of 2020, detected using our automated algorithms. The tool also suggests that orf3a proteins may be a suitable alternative target for diagnostic serologic assays in a post-vaccine surveillance setting. <h4>Conclusions</h4> The immuno-analytics tool can be accessed online ( http://genomics.lshtm.ac.uk/immuno ) and will serve as a useful resource for biological discovery and surveillance in the fight against SARS-CoV-2. Further, the tool may be adapted to inform on biological targets in future outbreaks, including potential emerging human coronaviruses that spill over from animal hosts.",,pdf:https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/11/18/2020.05.11.089409.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.11.089409; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR161915; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR161915&type=FILE&fileName=EMS93637-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Diagnosis rates for dementia have reached pre-pandemic levels for individuals of White ethnicity and those from less deprived socioeconomic communities, but remain lower than expected among individuals from other ethnicities and more deprived communities.

We studied the association between mortality and characteristics of HIV severity and management, and vaccination, among adult PWH. <h4>Methods</h4> We analysed observational cohort data on all PWH aged ≥15 years experiencing a diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection (until March 2022), who accessed public sector healthcare in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Logistic regression was used to study the association of mortality with CD4 cell count, viral load, evidence of ART, time since first HIV evidence, and vaccination, adjusting for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, admission pressure, location and time period. <h4>Results</h4> Mortality occurred in 5.7% (95% CI: 5.3,6.0) of 17 831 first diagnosed infections. Higher mortality was associated with lower recent CD4, no evidence of ART collection, high or unknown recent viral load (among those with ART evidence), and recent first HIV evidence, differentially by age. Vaccination was protective. The burden of comorbidities was high, and tuberculosis, chronic kidney disease, diabetes and hypertension were associated with higher mortality, more strongly in younger adults. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Mortality was strongly associated with suboptimal HIV control, and prevalence of these risk factors increased in later COVID-19 waves.

However, estimates of the magnitude of the Omicron wave have relied mainly on routine testing data, which are prone to several biases. Here we infer the dynamics of the Omicron wave in England using PCR testing and genomic sequencing obtained by the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study, a series of cross-sectional surveys testing random samples of the population of England. We estimate an initial peak in national Omicron prevalence of 6.89% (5.34%, 10.61%) during January 2022, followed by a resurgence in SARS-CoV-2 infections in England during February-March 2022 as the more transmissible Omicron sub-lineage, BA.2 replaced BA.1 and BA.1.1. Assuming the emergence of further distinct genomic variants, intermittent epidemics of similar magnitude as the Omicron wave may become the ‘new normal’.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/04/04/2022.03.29.22273042.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.29.22273042; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR477505; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR477505&type=FILE&fileName=EMS144175-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Although additional COVID-19 measures have been introduced in England and internationally to contain the epidemic, there remains uncertainty about the spread and severity of Omicron infections among the general population. <h4>Methods</h4> The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission–1 (REACT-1) study has been monitoring the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in England since May 2020. REACT-1 obtains self-administered throat and nose swabs from a random sample of the population of England at ages 5 years and over. Swabs are tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and samples testing positive are sent for viral genome sequencing. To date 16 rounds have been completed, each including ∼100,000 or more participants with data collected over a period of 2 to 3 weeks per month. Socio-demographic, lifestyle and clinical information (including previous history of COVID-19 and symptoms prior to swabbing) is collected by online or telephone questionnaire. Here we report results from round 14 (9-27 September 2021), round 15 (19 October - 05 November 2021) and round 16 (23 November - 14 December 2021) for a total of 297,728 participants with a valid RT-PCR test result, of whom 259,225 (87.1%) consented for linkage to their NHS records including detailed information on vaccination (vaccination status, date). We used these data to estimate community prevalence and trends by age and region, to evaluate vaccine effectiveness against infection in children ages 12 to 17 years, and effect of a third (booster) dose in adults, and to monitor the emergence of the Omicron variant in England. <h4>Results</h4> We observed a high overall prevalence of 1.41% (1.33%, 1.51%) in the community during round 16. We found strong evidence of an increase in prevalence during round 16 with an estimated reproduction number R of 1.13 (1.06, 1.09) for the whole of round 16 and 1.27 (1.14, 1.40) when restricting to observations from 1 December onwards. The reproduction number in those aged 18-54 years was estimated at 1.23 (1.14, 1.33) for the whole of round 16 and 1.41 (1.23, 1.61) from 1 December. Our data also provide strong evidence of a steep increase in prevalence in London with an estimated R of 1.62 (1.34, 1.93) from 1 December onwards and a daily prevalence reaching 6.07% (4.06%, 9.00%) on 14 December 2021. As of 1 to 11 December 2021, of the 275 lineages determined, 11 (4.0%) corresponded to the Omicron variant. The first Omicron infection was detected in London on 3 December, and subsequent infections mostly appeared in the South of England. The 11 Omicron cases were all aged 18 to 54 years, double-vaccinated (reflecting the large numbers of people who have received two doses of vaccine in this age group) but not boosted, 9 were men, 5 lived in London and 7 were symptomatic (5 with classic COVID-19 symptoms: loss or change of sense of smell or taste, fever, persistent cough), 2 were asymptomatic, and symptoms were unknown for 2 cases. The proportion of Omicron (vs Delta or Delta sub-lineages) was found to increase rapidly with a daily increase of 66.0% (32.7%, 127.3%) in the odds of Omicron (vs. Delta) infection, conditional on swab positivity. Highest prevalence of swab positivity by age was observed in (unvaccinated) children aged 5 to 11 years (4.74% [4.15%, 5.40%]) similar to the prevalence observed at these ages in round 15. In contrast, prevalence in children aged 12 to 17 years more than halved from 5.35% (4.78%, 5.99%) in round 15 to 2.31% (1.91%, 2.80%) in round 16. As of 14 December 2021, 76.6% children at ages 12 to 17 years had received at least one vaccine dose; we estimated that vaccine effectiveness against infection was 57.9% (44.1%, 68.3%) in this age group. In addition, the prevalence of swab positivity in adults aged 65 years and over fell by over 40% from 0.84% (0.72%, 0.99%) in round 15 to 0.48% (0.39%,0.59%) in round 16 and for those aged 75 years and over it fell by two-thirds from 0.63% (0.48%,0.82%) to 0.21% (0.13%,0.32%). At these ages a high proportion of participants (>90%) had received a third vaccine dose; we estimated that adults having received a third vaccine dose had a three- to four-fold lower risk of testing positive compared to those who had received two doses. <h4>Conclusion</h4> A large fall in swab positivity from round 15 to round 16 among 12 to 17 year olds, most of whom have been vaccinated, contrasts with the continuing high prevalence among 5 to 11 year olds who have largely not been vaccinated. Likewise there were large falls in swab positivity among people aged 65 years and over, the vast majority of whom have had a third (booster) vaccine dose; these results reinforce the importance of the vaccine and booster campaign. However, the rapidly increasing prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in England during December 2021, coincident with the rapid rise of Omicron infections, may lead to renewed pressure on health services. Additional measures beyond vaccination may be needed to control the current wave of infections and prevent health services (in England and other countries) from being overwhelmed. <h4>Summary</h4> The unprecedented rise in SARS-CoV-2 infections is concurrent with rapid spread of the Omicron variant in England and globally. We analysed prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and its dynamics in England from end of November to mid-December 2021 among almost 100,000 participants from the REACT-1 study. Prevalence was high during December 2021 with rapid growth nationally and in London, and of the proportion of infections due to Omicron. We observed a large fall in swab positivity among mostly vaccinated older children (12-17 years) compared with unvaccinated younger children (5-11 years), and in adults who received a third vs. two doses of vaccine. Our results reiterate the importance of vaccination and booster campaigns; however, additional measures may be needed to control the rapid growth of the Omicron variant.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/12/24/2021.12.22.21268252.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.22.21268252; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR436099; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR436099&type=FILE&fileName=EMS141883-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

The incidence of common arterial thrombotic events (mainly acute myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke) was generally lower after each vaccine dose, brand and combination. Similarly, the incidence of common venous thrombotic events, (mainly pulmonary embolism and lower limb deep venous thrombosis) was lower after vaccination. There was a higher incidence of previously reported rare harms after vaccination: vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia after first ChAdOx1 vaccination, and myocarditis and pericarditis after first, second and transiently after booster mRNA vaccination (BNT-162b2 and mRNA-1273).

Non-pharmacological treatments for these symptoms are poorly understood. This review summarises evidence for the effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatments for symptoms of PVS. It also summarises the symptoms and health impacts of PVS in individuals recruited to studies evaluating treatments. <h4>Methods and findings</h4> We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for PVS, as compared to either standard care, alternative non-pharmacological therapy, or placebo. The outcomes of interest were changes in symptoms, exercise capacity, quality of life (including mental health and wellbeing), and work capability. We searched five databases (Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, MedRxiv) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published between 1 st January 2001 to 29 th October 2021. We anticipated that there would be few RCTs specifically pertaining to Long COVID, so we also included observational studies only if they assessed interventions in individuals where the viral pathogen was SARS-COV-2. Relevant outcome data were extracted, study quality appraised using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and the findings were synthesised narratively. Quantitative synthesis was not planned due to substantial heterogeneity between the studies. Overall, five studies of five different interventions (Pilates, music therapy, telerehabilitation, resistance exercise, neuromodulation) met the inclusion criteria. Aside from music-based intervention, all other selected interventions demonstrated some support in the management of PVS in some patients. <h4>Conclusions</h4> In this study, we observed a lack of robust evidence evaluating non-pharmacological treatments for PVS, including Long COVID. Considering the prevalence of prolonged symptoms following acute viral infections, there is an urgent need for clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatments for patients with PVS as well as what may work for certain sub-groups of patients with differential symptom presentation. <h4>Registration</h4> The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO [CRD42021282074] in October 2021 and published in BMJ Open in 2022. <h4>Author summary</h4> Why was this study done? The prevalence of Long COVID following exposure to SARS CoV-2 is substantial, and the current guidance provides few evidence-based treatment options for clinicians to suggest to their patients. Due to the similarities in presentation of other post-viral syndromes (PVS), and the lack of consensus in management approaches, there is a need to synthesise the available data on PVS to both support patients with PVS predating the pandemic, and those with Long COVID. What did the researchers do and find? This is the first comprehensive systematic review of the effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatments for patients with PVS, including Long COVID. We identified four non-pharmacological treatments (Pilates, telerehabilitation, resistance exercises and neuromodulation) which have shown promise in those who have experienced signs and symptoms related to PVS. What do these findings mean? In this study, we identified few trials assessing the effectiveness of non-pharmacological therapies to support the management of symptoms of PVS. Considering the prevalence of PVS, including Long COVID, there is an urgent need for clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of non-pharmacological therapies to support these patients.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/06/07/2022.06.07.22276080.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.07.22276080; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR503564; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR503564&type=FILE&fileName=EMS162209-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

The third wave of COVID-19 in England began in May 2021 as the Delta variant began to outcompete and largely replace other strains. The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) series of community surveys for SARS-CoV-2 infection has provided insights into transmission dynamics since May 2020. Round 15 of the REACT-1 study was carried out from 19 October to 5 November 2021. <h4>Methods</h4> We estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV2 infection and used multiple logistic regression to analyse associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection in England and demographic and other risk factors, based on RT-PCR results from self-administered throat and nose swabs in over 100,000 participants. We estimated (single-dose) vaccine effectiveness among children aged 12 to 17 years, and among adults compared swab-positivity in people who had received a third (booster) dose with those who had received two vaccine doses. We used splines to analyse time trends in swab-positivity. <h4>Results</h4> During mid-October to early-November 2021, weighted prevalence was 1.57% (1.48%, 1.66%) compared to 0.83% (0.76%, 0.89%) in September 2021 (round 14). Weighted prevalence increased between rounds 14 and 15 across most age groups (including older ages, 65 years and over) and regions, with average reproduction number across rounds of R=1.09 (1.08, 1.11). During round 15, there was a fall in prevalence from a maximum around 20-21 October, with an R of 0.76 (0.70, 0.83), reflecting falls in prevalence at ages 17 years and below and 18 to 54 years. School-aged children had the highest weighted prevalence of infection: 4.95% (4.39%, 5.58%) in those aged 5 to 12 years and 5.21% (4.61%, 5.87%) in those aged 13 to 17 years. In multiple logistic regression, age, sex, key worker status and presence of one or more children in the home were associated with swab positivity. There was evidence of heterogeneity between rounds in swab positivity rates among vaccinated individuals at ages 18 to 64 years, and differences in key demographic and other variables between vaccinated and unvaccinated adults at these ages. Vaccine effectiveness against infection in children was estimated to be 56.2% (41.3%, 67.4%) in rounds 13, 14 and 15 combined, adjusted for demographic factors, with a similar estimate obtained for round 15 only. Among adults we found that those who received a third dose of vaccine were less likely to test positive compared to those who received only two vaccine doses, with adjusted odds ratio (OR) =0.38 (0.26, 0.55). <h4>Discussion</h4> Swab-positivity was very high at the start of round 15, reaching a maximum around 20 to 21 October 2021, and then falling through late October with an uncertain trend in the last few days of data collection. The observational nature of survey data and the relatively small proportion of unvaccinated adults call into question the comparability of vaccinated and unvaccinated groups at this relatively late stage in the vaccination programme. However, third vaccine doses for eligible adults and the vaccination of children aged 12 years and over are associated with lower infection risk and, thus, remain a high priority (with possible extension to children aged 5-12 years). These should help reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the winter period when healthcare demands typically rise.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/12/16/2021.12.14.21267806.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.14.21267806; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR432994; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR432994&type=FILE&fileName=EMS141765-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Round 17 data were collected between 5 and 20 January 2022 and provide data on the temporal, socio-demographic and geographical spread of the virus, viral loads and viral genome sequence data for positive swabs. <h4>Results</h4> From 102,174 valid tests in round 17, weighted prevalence of swab positivity was 4.41% (95% credible interval [CrI], 4.25% to 4.56%), which is over three-fold higher than in December 2021 in England. Of 3,028 sequenced positive swabs, 2,393 lineages were determined and 2,374 (99.2%) were Omicron including 19 (0.80% of all Omicron lineages) cases of BA.2 sub-lineage and one BA.3 (0.04% of all Omicron) detected on 17 January 2022, and only 19 (0.79%) were Delta. The growth of the BA.2 Omicron sub-lineage against BA.1 and its sub-lineage BA.1.1 indicated a daily growth rate advantage of 0.14 (95% CrI, 0.03, 0.28) for BA.2, which corresponds to an additive R advantage of 0.46 (95% CrI, 0.10, 0.92). Within round 17, prevalence was decreasing overall (R=0.95, 95% CrI, 0.93, 0.97) but increasing in children aged 5 to 17 years (R=1.13, 95% CrI, 1.09, 1.18). Those 75 years and older had a swab-positivity prevalence of 2.46% (95% CI, 2.16%, 2.80%) reflecting a high level of infection among a highly vulnerable group. Among the 3,613 swab-positive individuals reporting whether or not they had had previous infection, 2,334 (64.6%) reported previous confirmed COVID-19. Of these, 64.4% reported a positive test from 1 to 30 days before their swab date. Risks of infection were increased among essential/key workers (other than healthcare or care home workers) with mutually adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) of 1.15 (95% CI, 1.05, 1.26), people living in large compared to single-person households (6+ household size OR 1.73; 95% CI, 1.44, 2.08), those living in urban vs rural areas (OR 1.24, 95% CI, 1.13, 1.35) and those living in the most vs least deprived areas (OR 1.34, 95% CI, 1.20, 1.49). <h4>Conclusions</h4> We observed unprecedented levels of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in England in January 2022, an almost complete replacement of Delta by Omicron, and evidence for a growth advantage for BA.2 compared to BA.1. The increase in the prevalence of infection with Omicron among children (aged 5 to 17 years) during January 2022 could pose a risk to adults, despite the current trend for prevalence in adults to decline.

Included participants were the whole population of England aged 18 years or over (44.7 million), including 10,141 patients admitted to critical care with COVID-19. The intervention was vaccination with one, two, or a booster/three doses of any COVID-19 vaccine. <h4>Results</h4> Compared with unvaccinated patients, vaccinated patients were older (median 64 years for patients receiving two or more doses versus 50 years for unvaccinated), with higher levels of severe comorbidity (20.3% versus 3.9%) and immunocompromise (15.0% versus 2.3%). Compared with patients who were unvaccinated, those vaccinated with two doses had a relative risk reduction (RRR) of between 90.1% (patients aged 18–29, 95% CI, 86.8% to 92.7%) and 95.9% (patients aged 60–69, 95% CI, 95.5% to 96.2%).

We used electronic health records of all female residents in Scotland who were vaccinated between 6 weeks preconception and 19 weeks 6 days gestation (for miscarriage; n = 18,780) or 2 weeks 6 days gestation (for ectopic; n = 10,570). Primary analyses used unvaccinated women from the pre-pandemic period as controls (historical controls) matched (3:1) on maternal age, gestational age at vaccination, and season of conception; with adjustment for maternal deprivation level, rural/urban status and clinical vulnerability. Supplementary analyses used unvaccinated women from the pandemic period as controls (contemporary controls). Analyses of outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection were undertaken with infection rather than vaccination as the exposure.

The exposure of interest was the SARS-CoV-2 variant identified from NHS Test and Trace PCR positive tests taken in the community (pillar 2) and analysed by Lighthouse laboratories. Cause-specific Cox proportional hazard regression models were adjusted for sex, age, vaccination status, previous infection, calendar time, ethnicity, Index of Multiple Deprivation rank, household deprivation, university degree, keyworker status, country of birth, main language, region, disability, and comorbidities. Additionally, we tested for interactions between variant and sex, age, vaccination status and comorbidities. <h4>Results</h4> The risk of death involving COVID-19 was 67% lower for Omicron compared to Delta and the reduction in the risk of death involving COVID-19 for Omicron compared to Delta was more pronounced in males than in females and in people under 70 years old than in people aged 70 years or over. Regardless of age, reduction of the risk of death from Omicron relative to Delta more was more pronounced in people who had received a booster than in those having received only two doses. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Our results support early work showing the relative reduction in severity of Omicron compared to Delta in terms of hospitalisation and extends this research to assess COVID-19 mortality. Our work also highlights the importance of the vaccination booster campaign, where the reduction in risk of death involving COVID-19 is most pronounced in individuals who had received a booster. <h4>What is already known on this topic</h4> The Omicron variant, which refers to the whole lineage (BA.1, BA.2, BA.3) had already been shown to be more transmissible than the Delta variant, but there is emerging evidence suggests that the risk of hospitalisation and risk of death within 28 days after a SARS-COV-2 test is lower. However, with a highly transmissible infection and high levels of population testing, definition of death within 28 days is more likely to be susceptible to misclassification bias due to asymptomatic or co-incidental infection. There is no study so far comparing the risk of COVID-19 death as identified from death certification records, with the cause of death assessed by the physician who attended the patient in the last illness. <h4>What this study adds</h4> Using data from a large cohort of COVID-19 infections that occurred in December 2021, we examined the difference in the risk COVID-19 death, as identified from death certification records, between the Delta and Omicron BA.1 variant. Our study shows that risk of death involving COVID-19 was reduced by 67% following infection with the Omicron BA.1 variant relative to the Delta variant after adjusting for a wide range of potential confounders, including vaccination status and comorbidities. Importantly, we found that the relative risk of COVID-19 mortality following Omicron versus Delta infection varied by age and sex, with lower relative risk in younger individuals and for males than females. The reduction in risk of death involving COVID-19 was also most pronounced in individuals who had received a booster.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/02/25/2022.02.24.22271466.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.24.22271466; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR461923; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR461923&type=FILE&fileName=EMS148831-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Initial benefit was shown in unvaccinated patients and before the Omicron variant emerged. We used the OpenSAFELY platform to emulate target trials to estimate the effectiveness of sotrovimab or molnupiravir, versus no treatment. <h4>Methods</h4> With the approval of NHS England, we derived population-based cohorts of non-hospitalised high-risk individuals in England testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 during periods of dominance of the BA.1 (16/12/2021-10/02/2022) and BA.2 (11/02/2022-21/05/2022) Omicron sublineages. We used the clone-censor-weight approach to estimate the effect of treatment with sotrovimab or molnupiravir initiated within 5 days after positive test versus no treatment. Hazard ratios (HR) for COVID-19 hospitalisation or death within 28 days were estimated using weighted Cox models. <h4>Results</h4> Of the 35,856 [BA.1 period] and 39,192 [BA.2 period] patients, 1,830 [BA.1] and 1,242 [BA.2] were treated with molnupiravir and 2,244 [BA.1] and 4,164 [BA.2] with sotrovimab.

In order to identify key biomarkers, we measured brain injury markers, inflammatory mediators, and autoantibodies in 203 participants admitted to hospital for management of COVID-19; 111 provided acute sera (1-11 days post admission) and 56 with COVID-19-associated neurological diagnoses provided convalescent sera (up to76 weeks post admission). Compared to 60 controls, brain injury biomarkers (total-Tau, GFAP, NfL, UCH-L1) were increased in acute sera, significantly more so for NfL and UCH-L1, in participants with altered consciousness. Total-Tau (tTau) and NfL remained elevated in convalescent sera, particularly following cerebrovascular and neuroinflammatory disorders. Acutely, inflammatory mediators (including IL-6, IL-12p40, HGF, M-CSF, CCL2, and IL-1RA) were higher in participants with altered consciousness and correlated with brain injury biomarker levels. Inflammatory mediators were lower in convalescent sera than acute sera. Levels of CCL2, CCL7, IL-1RA, IL-2Rα, M-CSF, SCF, IL-16 and IL-18 in individual participants correlated with tTau levels even at later time points. When compared to acute COVID-19 patients with a normal Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS), network analysis showed significantly altered immune responses in patients with acute alteration of consciousness, and in convalescent patients who had suffered an acute neurological complication. The frequency and range of autoantibodies did not associate with neurological disorders. However, autoantibodies against specific antigens were more frequent in patients with altered consciousness in the acute phase (including MYL7, UCH-L1, GRIN3B, and DDR2), and in patients with neurological complications in the convalescent phase (including MYL7, GNRHR, and HLA antigens). In a novel low-inoculum mouse model of SARS-CoV-2, while viral replication was only consistently seen in mouse lungs, inflammatory responses were seen in both brain and lungs, with significant increases in CCL4, IFNγ, IL-17A, and microglial reactivity in the brain.

We assessed infection risks across work-related characteristics and compared findings using different ascertainment approaches. <h4>Methods</h4> Participants of 14 UK-based longitudinal cohort studies completed surveys before and during the COVID-19 pandemic about their health, work, and behaviour. These data were linked to NHS digital health records, including COVID-19 diagnostic testing, within the UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration (UK-LLC) research environment. Poisson regression modelled self-reported infection and diagnostic test confirmed infection within each cohort for work-related characteristics. Risk Ratios (RR) were then combined using random effects meta-analysis. <h4>Results</h4> Between March 2020 and March 2021, 72,290 individuals completed 167,302 surveys. Overall, 11% of 138,924 responses self-reported an infection, whereas 1.9% of 159,820 responses had a linked positive test. Self-reported infection risk was greater in key-workers vs not (RR=1.24(95%C.I.=1.17,1.31), among non-home working (1.08(0.98,1.19)) or some home working (1.08(0.97,1.17)) vs all home working. Part-time workers vs full-time (0.94(0.89,0.99)), and furlough vs not (0.97(0.88,1.01)) had reduced risk. Results for the linked positive test outcome were comparable in direction but greater in magnitude e.g. an 1.85(1.56,2.20) in key-workers. <h4>Conclusion</h4> The UK-LLC provides new opportunities for researchers to investigate risk factors, including occupational factors, for ill-health events in multiple largescale UK cohorts. Risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 illness appeared to be associated with work-related characteristics. Associations using linked diagnostic test data appeared stronger than self-reported infection status. <h4>What is already known on this topic</h4> - Infection of SARS-CoV2 during the pandemic was shown to vary by occupation, with occupations such as healthcare, and education at higher risk during some or all of the pandemic. - What is not clear, is how are work-related characteristics such employment status, part-time working from home, and schemes such as furlough and key worker status associated with the risk of infection. <h4>What this study adds</h4> - This is the one of the first studies to examine work-related characteristics including work related government policies, in terms of their infection risk within the working population. - This is also one of the first studies to analyse data from the UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration (UK-LLC), in which multiple UK national longitudinal cohorts were linked to national health data including diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV2. - We further compared definitions infection via either a self-reported case of COVID-19 or a linked diagnostic SARS-CoV2 infection. <h4>How this study might affect Research Practice or Policy</h4> - The findings contribute to our understanding of work-related characteristics and related schemes were associated with infection risk under two definitions. This is pertinent given new and emerging variants are continuing to drive an ever-changing SARS-CoV-2 infection risk within the population, along with the need to adequately prepare for future pandemics that may occur.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/12/19/2023.12.19.23298502.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.19.23298502; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR776537; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR776537&type=FILE&fileName=EMS192962-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

An observational study,"Sapey E, Gallier S, Evison F, Hodson J, McNulty D, Reeves K, Ball S.",,No Journal Info,2022,2022-04-20,Y,,,,"<h4>Objectives</h4> NHS England (NHSE) advocates using “reason to reside” (R2R) criteria to generate a binary outcome, which supports discharge related clinical decision making. The proportion of patients without R2R and their rate of discharge are reported daily, by acute hospitals in England. R2R is however, not based upon an inter-operable standardised data model (SDM), nor has its performance been validated against its purpose. We aimed to understand the degree of inter- and intra-centre variation in R2R related metrics reported to NHSE, define a SDM implemented within a single centre Electronic Health Record to generate an eR2R, and evaluate its performance in predicting subsequent discharge. <h4>Design</h4> Retrospective observational cohort study using routinely collected health data. <h4>Setting</h4> 122 NHS Trusts in England for national reporting and an adult acute hospital in England for local reporting. <h4>Participants</h4> 6,602,706 patient-days were analysed using 3 months national data and 1,039,592 patient-days, using 3 years single centre data. <h4>Main outcome measures</h4> Variability in R2R related metrics reported to NHSE. Performance of eR2R in predicting discharge within 24 hours. <h4>Results</h4> There were high levels of intra and inter-centre variability in R2R related metrics (p<0.0001), but not in eR2R. Informedness of eR2R for discharge within 24 hours was low (J-statistic 0.09 – 0.12 across three consecutive years). In those remaining in hospital without eR2R, 61.2% met eR2R criteria on subsequent days (76% within 24 hours), most commonly due to increased NEWS2 (21.9%) or intravenous therapy administration (32.8%). <h4>Conclusions</h4> R2R related performance metrics are highly variable between and within acute Trusts in England. Although case-mix or community care provision may account for some variability, the absence of a SDM is a major barrier to meaningful interpretation of these metrics. The performance of eR2R based on two alternative SDM’s was poor, such that they could not meaningfully contribute to clinical decision making or evaluation of performance. <h4>Summary</h4> <h4>What is known</h4> There is considerable pressure on hospital bed capacity and significant variation in hospital discharges with concerns raised about delays in discharge planning across National Health Service Trusts. To address this, the UK Government developed a policy and criteria to identify in-patients in whom discharge home, or to a less acute setting, should be considered. The criteria, called “reasons to reside” (R2R) have been promoted as a tool to improve discharge planning and are a mandated metric for central reporting. The performance of R2R has not been assessed. <h4>What this study adds</h4> This study suggests a low performance of the R2R criteria as a clinical tool to identify patients suitable for discharge, and questions its usefulness as a reported metric in its current form. There is significant intra and inter-centre variability in both the reported proportion of patients not meeting R2R criteria, and the proportion of patients not meeting R2R criteria who were later discharged. The proportion of patients not meeting R2R criteria correlates poorly with their rate of discharge over the subsequent 24 hours and the performance of the R2R criteria as dichotomous test to identify patients suitable for discharge is low. Further, the R2R criteria are not a stable phenomenon, with more than half of those who remain in hospital without R2R, subsequently acquiring a R2R during the admission.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/04/20/2022.04.19.22274037.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.19.22274037; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR485354; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR485354&type=FILE&fileName=EMS144570-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

A possible explanation is people leaving the workforce after contracting COVID-19. We investigated whether testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 is related to subsequent economic inactivity and non-employment, among people employed pre-pandemic. <h4>Methods</h4> The data came from five UK longitudinal population studies held by both the UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration (UK LLC; primary analyses) and the UK Data Service (UKDS; secondary analyses). We pooled data from five long established studies (1970 British Cohort Study, English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, 1958 National Child Development Study, Next Steps, and Understanding Society). The study population were aged 25-65 years between March 2020 to March 2021 and employed pre-pandemic. Outcomes were economic inactivity and non-employment measured at the time of the last follow-up survey (November 2020 to March 2021, depending on study). For the UK LLC sample (n=8,174), COVID-19 infection was indicated by a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in NHS England records. For the UKDS sample we used self-reported measures of COVID-19 infection (n=13,881). Logistic regression models estimated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) adjusting for potential confounders including sociodemographic variables, pre-pandemic health and occupational class. <h4>Rebsults</h4> Testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 was very weakly associated with economic inactivity (OR 1.08 95%CI 0.68-1.73) and non-employment status (OR 1.09. 95%CI 0.77-1.55) in the primary analyses. In secondary analyses, self-reported test-confirmed COVID-19 was not associated with either economic inactivity (OR 1.01 95%CI 0.70-1.44) or non-employment status (OR 1.03 95%CI 0.79-1.35). <h4>Conclusions</h4> Among people employed pre-pandemic, testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 was either weakly or not associated with increased economic inactivity or non-employment. Research on the recent increases in economic inactivity should focus on other potential causes. <h4>Key messages</h4> <h4>What is already known on this topic</h4> Economic inactivity has increased following the pandemic. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to lead to post-COVID-19 condition, which is associated with reduced working capacity and absences from work. It is unclear if infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to economic inactivity among those who were initially in employment just before the pandemic. <h4>What this study adds</h4> Infection is only very weakly or not associated with economic inactivity and non-employment in people who were in employment just prior to the pandemic. <h4>How this study might affect research, practice or policy</h4> Alternative explanations for the rise in economic inactivity need to be investigated such as long-term sickness. Possible biases introduced by linkage consent need considering when using linked healthcare data.",,doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.31.23293422; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR700442; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR700442&type=FILE&fileName=EMS183903-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We determined the proportion of people with rheumatology hospital outpatient appointments each month (April 2019-December 2022 (Wales and Scotland), April 2019-November 2023 (England)) and quantified changes using interrupted time-series analysis. We used logistic regression to determine characteristics associated with having fewer appointments compared to 2019. <h4>Results</h4> We identified 145,065, 3,813 and 13,637 individuals coded with RA in England, Scotland, and Wales, respectively. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic the number of rheumatology outpatient appointments dropped sharply across all nations. In England and Scotland, the percentage of monthly appointments has continued to decline. In Wales, while there was a gradual recovery, rheumatology services have not returned to pre-pandemic levels. In contrast, the number of appointments for all other specialist outpatient appointments have recovered in all nations. Ethnic minorities, those living in more deprived areas and urban areas had fewer appointments after the start of the pandemic compared to 2019. <h4>Conclusion</h4> For the first time, we compared healthcare use across three UK nations and found that rheumatology outpatient appointments had not recovered to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, particularly in Scotland and England. Certain patient groups had fewer appointments during the study period. <h4>Key messages</h4> Rheumatology outpatient appointments remain below pre-pandemic levels, particularly in England and Scotland, unlike other specialties. Ethnic minorities, deprived communities, and urban residents had fewer rheumatology appointments post-pandemic than in 2019.

In addition, we assess sensitivity to neutralisation by commonly used therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. We find sera collected post-vaccination have a similar ability to neutralise BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4/BA.5. In contrast, in the absence of vaccination, prior infection with BA.2 or, in particular, BA.1 results in an antibody response that neutralises BA.4/BA.5 poorly. Breakthrough infection with Omicron in vaccinees leads to a broad neutralising response against the new variants. The sensitivity of BA.4/BA.5 to neutralisation by therapeutic monoclonal antibodies was similar to that of BA.2. These data suggest BA.4/BA.5 are antigenically distinct from BA.1 and, to a lesser extent, BA.2.

Case incidence data from the national testing programme (Pillar 2) in England may be affected by changes in testing behaviour and other biases. Community surveys may provide important contextual information to inform policy and the public health response. <h4>Methods</h4> We estimated patterns of community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in England using RT-PCR swab-positivity, demographic and other risk factor data from round 15 (interim) of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study (round 15a, carried out from 19 to 29 October 2021). We compared these findings with those from round 14 (9 to 27 September 2021). <h4>Results</h4> During mid- to late-October 2021 (round 15a) weighted prevalence was 1.72% (1.61%, 1.84%) compared to 0.83% (0.76%, 0.89%) in September 2021 (round 14). The overall reproduction number (R) from round 14 to round 15a was 1.12 (1.11, 1.14) with increases in prevalence over this period (September to October) across age groups and regions except Yorkshire and The Humber. However, within round 15a (mid- to late-October) there was evidence of a fall in prevalence with R of 0.76 (0.65, 0.88). The highest weighted prevalence was observed among children aged 5 to 12 years at 5.85% (5.10%, 6.70%) and 13 to 17 years at 5.75% (5.02%, 6.57%). At regional level, there was an almost four-fold increase in weighted prevalence in South West from round 14 at 0.59% (0.43%,0.80%) to round 15a at 2.18% (1.84%, 2.58%), with highest smoothed prevalence at subregional level also found in South West in round 15a. Age, sex, key worker status, and presence of children in the home jointly contributed to the risk of swab-positivity. Among the 126 sequenced positive swabs obtained up until 23 October, all were Delta variant; 13 (10.3%) were identified as the AY.4.2 sub-lineage. <h4>Discussion</h4> We observed the highest overall prevalence of swab-positivity seen in the REACT-1 study in England to date in round 15a (October 2021), with a two-fold rise in swab-positivity from round 14 (September 2021). Despite evidence of a fall in prevalence from mid- to late-October 2021, prevalence remains high, particularly in school-aged children, with evidence also of higher prevalence in households with one or more children. Thus, vaccination of children aged 12 and over remains a high priority (with possible extension to children aged 5-12) to help reduce within-household transmission and disruptions to education, as well as among adults, to lessen the risk of serious disease among those infected.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/11/03/2021.11.03.21265877.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.03.21265877; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR415631; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR415631&type=FILE&fileName=EMS138032-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

To ensure protection remains high in vulnerable groups booster vaccinations in the UK have been targeted based on age and clinical vulnerabilities. <h4>Objective</h4> We sought to identify adults who had received a booster vaccination as part of the autumn 2022 campaign in England yet remained at increased risk of postbooster COVID-19 death and compared to non-COVID-19 risk. <h4>Design, Setting, and Participants</h4> We undertook a national retrospective cohort study using data from the 2021 Census linked to electronic health records. We fitted cause-specific Cox models to examine the association between health conditions and the risk of COVID-19 death and all-other-cause death for adults aged 50-100-years in England vaccinated with a booster in autumn 2022. Our total population was 14,644,570 people; there were 6,800 COVID-19 deaths and 150,075 non-COVID-19 deaths. <h4>Exposure</h4> Sociodemographic characteristics (sex, age, ethnic group, region), disability, body mass index, and diagnosis of a health condition defined from QCovid2. <h4>Main Outcomes and Measures</h4> The primary outcome of this study was COVID-19 death. The secondary outcome was all-cause non-COVID-19 deaths. <h4>Results</h4> Having learning disabilities or Down Syndrome (hazard ratio=5.07;95% confidence interval=3.69-6.98), pulmonary hypertension or fibrosis (2.88;2.43-3.40), motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia or Huntington’s disease (2.94, 1.82-4.74), cancer of blood and bone marrow (3.11;2.72-3.56), Parkinson’s disease (2.74;2.34-3.20), lung or oral cancer (2.57;2.04 to 3.24), dementia (2.64;2.46 to 2.83) or liver cirrhosis (2.65;1.95 to 3.59) was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death. Individuals with cancer of the blood or bone marrow, chronic kidney disease, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypotension or fibrosis, or rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus had a significantly higher risk of COVID-19 death relative to other causes of death compared with individuals who did not have diagnoses. <h4>Conclusions, and Relevance</h4> We identify groups who are at increased risk of postbooster COVID-19 death relative to non-COVID-19 deaths. Policy makers should continue to priorities vulnerable groups for subsequent COVID-19 booster doses to minimise the risk of COVID-19 death. <h4>Funding</h4> National Core Studies–Immunity, National Core Studies–Data and Connectivity, Health Data Research UK, and the Medical Research Council . <h4>Key Points</h4> Question: What health conditions are associated with increased risk of postbooster COVID-19 death in adults who received a COVID-19 vaccination in autumn 2022? <h4>Findings: </h4> Certain groups were found to be at overall higher risk of postbooster COVID-19 death (e.g., learning disability or Down Syndrome) and certain groups were found to have significantly higher relative risk of COVID-19 death compared to other non-COVID-19 causes (e.g., cancer of the blood or bone marrow).

The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study is a repeat cross-sectional study of over 98,000 people every round (rounds approximately monthly) that estimates infection prevalence in England. We used Bayesian P-splines to estimate prevalence and the time-varying reproduction number ( R t ) nationally, regionally and by age group from round 8 (beginning 6 January 2021) to round 13 (ending 12 July 2021) of REACT-1. As a comparator, a separate segmented-exponential model was used to quantify the impact on R t of each relaxation of restrictions. <h4>Results</h4> Following an initial plateau of 1.54% until mid-January, infection prevalence decreased until 13 May when it reached a minimum of 0.09%, before increasing until the end of the study to 0.76%. Following the first easing of restrictions, which included schools reopening, the reproduction number R t increased by 82% (55%, 108%), but then decreased by 61% (82%, 53%) at the second easing of restrictions, which was timed to match the Easter school holidays. Following further relaxations of restrictions, the observed R t increased steadily, though the increase due to these restrictions being relaxed was masked by the effects of vaccination and the rapid rise of Delta. There was a high degree of synchrony in the temporal patterns of prevalence between regions and age groups. <h4>Conclusion</h4> High-resolution prevalence data fitted to P-splines allowed us to show that the lockdown was highly effective at reducing risk of infection with school holidays/closures playing a significant part.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/06/02/2022.06.02.22275900.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.02.22275900; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR501811; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR501811&type=FILE&fileName=EMS145736-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We estimated the costs of primary care consultations associated with long COVID and explored the relationship between risk factors and costs. Methods  Data were obtained on non-hospitalised adults from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum primary care database. We used propensity score matching with an incremental cost method to estimate additional primary care consultation costs associated with long COVID (12 weeks after COVID-19) at an individual and UK national level. We applied multivariable regression models to estimate the association between risk factors and consultations costs beyond 12 weeks from acute COVID-19. Results  Based on an analysis of 472,173 patients with Covid-19 and 472,173 unexposed individuals, the annual incremental cost of primary care consultations associated with long COVID was £2.44 per patient and £23,382,452 at the national level. Among patients with COVID-19, a long COVID diagnosis and longer-term reporting of symptoms were associated with a 43% and 44% increase in primary care consultation costs respectively, compared to patients without long COVID symptoms. Older age, female sex, obesity, being from a white ethnic group, comorbidities and prior consultation frequency were all associated with increased primary care consultation costs. Conclusions  The costs of primary care consultations associated with long COVID in non-hospitalised adults are substantial.

This study describes ethnicity data in nation-wide electronic health records in England, UK. <h4>Methods</h4> We conducted a retrospective cohort study using de-identified person-level records for the England population available in the National Health Service (NHS) Digital trusted research environment. Primary care records (GDPPR) were linked to hospital and national mortality records. We assessed completeness, consistency, and granularity of ethnicity records using all available SNOMED-CT concepts for ethnicity and NHS ethnicity categories. <h4>Findings</h4> From 61.8 million individuals registered with a primary care practice in England, 51.5 (83.3%) had at least one ethnicity record in GDPPR, increasing to 93·9% when linked with hospital records. Approximately 12·0% had at least two conflicting ethnicity codes in primary care records. Women were more likely to have ethnicity recorded than men. Ethnicity was missing most frequently in individuals from 18 to 39 years old and in the southern regions of England. Individuals with an ethnicity record had more comorbidities recorded than those without. Of 489 SNOMED-CT ethnicity concepts available, 255 were used in primary care records. Discrepancies between SNOMED-CT and NHS ethnicity categories were observed, specifically within “Other-” ethnicity groups. <h4>Interpretation</h4> More than 250 ethnicity sub-groups may be found in health records for the English population, although commonly categorised into “White”, “Black”, “Asian”, “Mixed”, and “Other”. One in ten individuals do not have ethnicity information recorded in primary care or hospital records. SNOMED-CT codes represent more diversity in ethnicity groups than the NHS ethnicity classification. Improved recording of self-reported ethnicity at first point-of-care and consistency in ethnicity classification across healthcare settings can potentially improve the accuracy of ethnicity in research and ultimately care for all ethnicities. <h4>Funding</h4> British Heart Foundation Data Science Centre led by Health Data Research UK. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> Ethnicity has been highlighted as a significant factor in the disproportionate impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality. Better knowledge of ethnicity data recorded in real clinical practice is required to improve health research and ultimately healthcare. We searched PubMed from database inception to 14 th July 2022 for publications using the search terms “ethnicity” and “electronic health records” or “EHR,” without language restrictions. 228 publications in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, and 304 publications between 2020 and 2022 were identified. However, none of these publications used or reported any of over 400 available SNOMED-CT concepts for ethnicity to account for more granularity and diversity than captured by traditional high-level classification limited to 5 to 9 ethnicity groups. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> We provide a comprehensive study of the largest collection of ethnicity records from a national-level electronic health records trusted research environment, exploring completeness, consistency, and granularity. This work can serve as a data resource profile of ethnicity from routinely-collected EHR in England. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> To achieve equity in healthcare, we need to understand the differences between individuals, as well as the influence of ethnicity both on health status and on health interventions, including variation in the behaviour of tests and therapies. Thus, there is a need for measurements, thresholds, and risk estimates to be tailored to different ethnic groups. This study presents the different medical concepts describing ethnicity in routinely collected data that are readily available to researchers and highlights key elements for improving their accuracy in research. We aim to encourage researchers to use more granular ethnicity than the than typical approaches which aggregate ethnicity into a limited number of categories, failing to reflect the diversity of underlying populations. Accurate ethnicity data will lead to a better understanding of individual diversity, which will help to address disparities and influence policy recommendations that can translate into better, fairer health for all.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/11/11/2022.11.11.22282217.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.11.11.22282217; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR570165; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.11.11.22282217

However, with increasing levels of immunity through vaccination and natural infection the evolutionary pressure will switch towards immune escape. Here we present phylogenetic relationships and lineage dynamics within England (a country with high levels of immunity), as inferred from a random community sample of individuals who provided a self-administered throat and nose swab for rt-PCR testing as part of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study. From 9 to 27 September 2021 (round 14) and 19 October to 5 November 2021 (round 15), all lineages sequenced within REACT-1 were Delta or a Delta sub-lineage with 44 unique lineages identified. The proportion of the original Delta variant (B.1.617.2) was found to be increasing between September and November 2021, which may reflect an increasing number of sub-lineages which have yet to be identified. The proportion of B.1.617.2 was greatest in London, which was further identified as a region with an increased level of genetic diversity. The Delta sub-lineage AY.4.2 was found to be robustly increasing in proportion, with a reproduction number 15% (8%, 23%) greater than its parent and most prevalent lineage, AY.4.

Data were collected between November 2022 and October 2023 in England. OpenPROMPT was designed to measure the impact of long COVID on health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL). With the approval of NHS England we collected responses from 7,574 individuals, with detailed questionnaire responses from 6,337 individuals who responded using a smartphone app. Data were collected from each participant over 90 days at 30-day intervals using questionnaires to ask about HRQoL, productivity and symptoms of long COVID. Responses from the majority of OpenPROMPT (6,006; 79.3%) were linked to participants’ existing health records from primary care, secondary care, COVID-19 testing and vaccination data. Analysis takes place using the OpenSAFELY data analysis platform which provides a secure software interface allowing the analysis of pseudonymized primary care patient records from England. OpenPROMPT can currently be used to estimate the impact of long COVID on HRQoL, and because of the linkage within OpenSAFELY, the data from OpenPROMPT can be used to enrich routinely collected records in further research by approved researchers on behalf of NHS England. <h4>Lay summary</h4> OpenPROMPT is a study which used a phone app to conduct a longitudinal survey aimed at measuring the health related quality of life of people living with long COVID. The study recruited participants between November 2022 and July 2023 and followed them up for 90 days. The key advantage of this study is that the responses are linked to the individual’s personal health records, so we have access to much more data than the questionnaire responses alone. Here, we summarised who has used the app, how much data has been collected and the quality of the data. We also provide details to document how and why the data were collected so that the data can be used by other researchers in the future. This will maximise the benefit of this study, and ensure that the time invested by participants is put to best use. In this study we aimed to provide lots of important information about how many people are involved, how much information we have about them, their age, where they live, and how healthy they are. Finally, for certain variables we compared the responses people recorded in the app with what is kept on their electronic record to see if they agree or disagree. <h4>Key features</h4> OpenPROMPT is a cohort of individuals with longitudinal patient reported questionnaire data and linked to routinely collected health data from primary and secondary care.

We compared individuals who had received two doses of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 with unvaccinated individuals during six 4-week comparison periods, separately for subgroups aged 65+ years; 16-64 years and clinically vulnerable; 40-64 years and 18-39 years. We used Cox regression, stratified by first dose eligibility and geographical region and controlled for calendar time, to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) comparing vaccinated with unvaccinated individuals, and quantified waning vaccine effectiveness as ratios of aHRs per-4-week period. The outcomes were COVID-19 hospitalisation, COVID-19 death, positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and non-COVID-19 death. <h4>Findings</h4> The BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 and unvaccinated groups comprised 1,773,970, 2,961,011 and 2,433,988 individuals, respectively. Waning of vaccine effectiveness was similar across outcomes and vaccine brands: e.g. in the 65+ years subgroup ratios of aHRs versus unvaccinated for COVID-19 hospitalisation, COVID-19 death and positive SARS-CoV-2 test ranged from 1.23 (95% CI 1.15-1.32) to 1.27 (1.20-1.34) for BNT162b2 and 1.16 (0.98-1.37) to 1.20 (1.14-1.27) for ChAdOx1. Despite waning, rates of COVID-19 hospitalisation and COVID-19 death were substantially lower among vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals up to 26 weeks after second dose, with estimated aHRs <0.20 (>80% vaccine effectiveness) for BNT162b2, and <0.26 (>74%) for ChAdOx1. By weeks 23-26, rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in fully vaccinated individuals were similar to or higher than those in unvaccinated individuals: aHRs ranged from 0.85 (0.78-0.92) to 1.53 (1.07-2.18) for BNT162b2, and 1.21 (1.13-1.30) to 1.99 (1.94-2.05) for ChAdOx1. <h4>Interpretation</h4> The rate at which estimated vaccine effectiveness waned was strikingly consistent for COVID-19 hospitalisation, COVID-19 death and positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and similar across subgroups defined by age and clinical vulnerability.

Here, we assess the impact of an increased circulation of other respiratory viruses on the monitoring of positivity rates of SARS-CoV-2 and interpretation of surveillance data. <h4>Methods</h4> Using a multi-pathogen Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) transmission model formalizing co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and another respiratory we assess how an outbreak of secondary virus may inflate the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests and affect the interpretation of COVID-19 surveillance data. Using simulation, we assess to what extent the use of multiplex PCR tests on a subsample of symptomatic individuals can support correction of the observed SARS-CoV-2 percent positive during other virus outbreaks and improve surveillance quality. <h4>Results</h4> Model simulations demonstrated that a non-SARS-CoV-2 epidemic creates an artificial decrease in the observed percent positivity of SARS-CoV-2, with stronger effect during the growth phase, until the peak is reached. We estimate that performing one multiplex test for every 1,000 COVID-19 tests on symptomatic individuals could be sufficient to maintain surveillance of other respiratory viruses in the population and correct the observed SARS-CoV-2 percent positive. <h4>Conclusions</h4> This study highlights that co-circulating respiratory viruses can disrupt SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. Correction of the positivity rate can be achieved by using multiplex PCR, and a low number of samples is sufficient to avoid bias in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. <h4>Summary</h4> COVID-19 surveillance indicators may be impacted by increased co-circulation of other respiratory viruses delaying control measure implementation.

NCT04579640 <h4>SUMMARY BOX</h4> <h4>What is already known on this topic?</h4> Vitamin D metabolites support innate immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other respiratory pathogens. Sub-optimal vitamin D status (25-hydroxyvitamin D <75 nmol/L) associates with increased susceptibility to all-cause acute respiratory infections (ARI) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Phase 3 randomised controlled trials of vitamin D to prevent COVID-19 have not yet reported. <h4>What this study adds</h4> This phase 3 randomised controlled trial, including 6200 participants, shows that implementation of a population-level test-and-treat approach to oral vitamin D replacement at a dose of 800 IU or 3200 IU per day did not reduce risk of all-cause ARI or COVID-19 among adults with a high baseline prevalence of sub-optimal vitamin D status.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/06/24/2022.03.22.22271707.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.22.22271707; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR471508; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR471508&type=FILE&fileName=EMS149098-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

The secondary outcome of interest was COVID-19 hospital admission. Models fitted in the derivation cohort to derive risk equations using a range of predictor variables. Performance evaluated in a separate validation cohort. <h4>Results</h4> Of 1,297,984 people with a SARS-CoV-2 positive test in the derivation cohort, 18,756 (1.45%) had a COVID-19 related hospital admission and 3,878 (0.3%) had a COVID-19 death during follow-up. Of the 145,404 people in the validation cohort, there were 2,124 (1.46%) COVID-19 admissions and 461 (0.3%) COVID-19 deaths. The COVID-19 mortality rate in men increased with age and deprivation. In the QCovid4 model in men hazard ratios were highest for those with the following conditions (for 95% CI see Figure 1): kidney transplant (6.1-fold increase); Down’s syndrome (4.9-fold); radiotherapy (3.1-fold); type 1 diabetes (3.4-fold); chemotherapy grade A (3.8-fold), grade B (5.8-fold); grade C (10.9-fold); solid organ transplant ever (2.4-fold); dementia (1.62-fold); Parkinson’s disease (2.2-fold); liver cirrhosis (2.5-fold). Other conditions associated with increased COVID-19 mortality included learning disability, chronic kidney disease (stages 4 and 5), blood cancer, respiratory cancer, immunosuppressants, oral steroids, COPD, coronary heart disease, stroke, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, thromboembolism, rheumatoid/SLE, schizophrenia/bipolar disease sickle cell/HIV/SCID; type 2 diabetes. Results were similar in the model in women. COVID-19 mortality risk was lower among those who had received COVID-19 vaccination compared with unvaccinated individuals with evidence of a dose response relationship. The reduced mortality rates associated with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were similar in men (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.51 (95% CI 0.40, 0.64)) and women (adjusted HR 0.55 (95%CI 0.45, 0.67)). The QCOVID4 algorithm explained 76.6% (95%CI 74.4 to 78.8) of the variation in time to COVID-19 death (R 2 ) in women. The D statistic was 3.70 (95%CI 3.48 to 3.93) and the Harrell’s C statistic was 0.965 (95%CI 0.951 to 0.978). The corresponding results for COVID-19 death in men were similar with R 2 76.0% (95% 73.9 to 78.2); D statistic 3.65 (95%CI 3.43 to 3.86) and C statistic of 0.970 (95%CI 0.962 to 0.979). QCOVID4 discrimination for mortality was slightly higher than that for QCOVID1 and QCOVID2, but calibration was much improved. <h4>Conclusion</h4> The QCovid4 risk algorithm modelled from data during the UK’s Omicron wave now includes vaccination dose and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and predicts COVID-19 mortality among people with a positive test. It has excellent performance and could be used for targeting COVID-19 vaccination and therapeutics. Although large disparities in risks of severe COVID-19 outcomes among ethnic minority groups were observed during the early waves of the pandemic, these are much reduced now with no increased risk of mortality by ethnic group. <h4>What is known</h4> The QCOVID risk assessment algorithm for predicting risk of COVID-19 death or hospital admission based on individual characteristics has been used in England to identify people at high risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, adding an additional 1.5 million people to the national shielded patient list in England and in the UK for prioritising people for COVID-19 vaccination. There are ethnic disparities in severe COVID-19 outcomes which were most marked in the first pandemic wave in 2020. COVID-19 vaccinations and therapeutics (monoclonal antibodies and antivirals) are available but need to be targeted to those at highest risk of severe outcomes. <h4>What this study adds</h4> The QCOVID4 risk algorithm using data from the Omicron wave now includes number of vaccination doses and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. It has excellent performance both for ranking individuals (discrimination) and predicting levels of absolute risk (calibration) and can be used for targeting COVID-19 vaccination and therapeutics as well as individualised risk assessment. QCOVID4 more accurately identifies individuals at highest levels of absolute risk for targeted interventions than the ‘conditions-based’ approach adopted by NHS Digital based on relative risk of a list of medical conditions. Although large disparities in risks of severe COVID-19 outcomes among ethnic minority groups were observed during the early waves of the pandemic, these are much reduced now with no increased risk of mortality by ethnic group.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/08/16/2022.08.13.22278733.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.13.22278733; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR532697; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR532697&type=FILE&fileName=EMS152911-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We have previously reported that higher dose corticosteroids cause harm in patients with hypoxia but not receiving ventilatory support (non-invasive mechanical ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation), but the balance of efficacy and safety in patients receiving ventilatory support is uncertain. <h4>Methods</h4> This randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]) assessed multiple possible treatments in patients hospitalised for COVID-19. Eligible and consenting adult patients receiving ventilatory support were randomly allocated (1:1) to either usual care with higher dose corticosteroids (dexamethasone 20 mg once daily for 5 days followed by 10 mg once daily for 5 days or until discharge if sooner) or usual standard of care alone (which includes dexamethasone 6 mg once daily for 10 days or until discharge if sooner). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality; secondary outcomes were duration of hospitalisation and (among participants not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline) the composite of invasive mechanical ventilation or death. Recruitment closed on 31 March 2024 when funding for the trial ended. The RECOVERY trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT04381936 ). <h4>Findings</h4> Between 25 May 2021 and 9 January 2024, 477 COVID-19 patients receiving ventilatory support were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus higher dose corticosteroids versus usual care alone (of whom 99% received corticosteroids during the follow-up period). Of those randomised, 221 (46%) were in Asia, 245 (51%) in the UK and 11 (2%) in Africa. 143 (30%) had diabetes mellitus. Overall, 86 (35%) of 246 patients allocated to higher dose corticosteroids versus 86 (37%) of 231 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio [RR] 0.87; 95% CI 0.64-1.18; p=0.37). There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (128 [52%] in the higher dose corticosteroids group vs 120 [52%] in the usual care group; RR 1.04, 0.81-1.33]; p=0.78). Among those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, there was no significant difference in the proportion meeting the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (76 [37%] of 206 vs 93 [45%] of 205; RR 0.79 [95% CI 0.63–1.00]; p=0.05). <h4>Interpretation</h4> In patients hospitalised for COVID-19 receiving ventilatory support, we found no evidence that higher dose corticosteroids reduced the risk of death compared to usual care, which included low dose corticosteroids. <h4>Funding</h4> UK Research and Innovation (Medical Research Council) and National Institute of Health Research (Grant ref: MC_PC_19056), and Wellcome Trust (Grant Ref: 222406/Z/20/Z).",,doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.09.04.24312992; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.09.04.24312992; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR906782; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR906782&type=FILE&fileName=EMS198596-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Temporal trends in social mixing, incident acute respiratory infections (ARI) and asthma exacerbations following relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions have not yet been described. <h4>Methods</h4> We conducted a population-based longitudinal study in 2,312 UK adults with asthma between November 2020 and April 2022. Details of face covering use, social mixing, incident ARI and moderate/severe asthma exacerbations were collected via monthly on-line questionnaires. Temporal changes in these parameters were visualised using Poisson generalised additive models. Multilevel logistic regression was used to test for associations between incident ARI and risk of asthma exacerbations, adjusting for potential confounders. <h4>Results</h4> Relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions from April 2021 coincided with reduced face covering use (p<0.001), increased frequency of indoor visits to public places and other households (p<0.001) and rising incidence of COVID-19 (p<0.001), non-COVID-19 ARI (p<0.001) and moderate/severe asthma exacerbations (p=0.007). Incident non-COVID-19 ARI associated independently with increased risk of asthma exacerbation (adjusted odds ratio 5.75, 95% CI 4.75 to 6.97) as did incident COVID-19, both prior to emergence of the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 (5.89, 3.45 to 10.04) and subsequently (5.69, 3.89 to 8.31). <h4>Conclusions</h4> Relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions coincided with decreased face covering use, increased social mixing and a rebound in ARI and asthma exacerbations.

Prevalence (adjusted and weighted) increased with age, from 35.8% (35.1-36.5) in those aged 18 to 24 years, to 95.3% (94.6-95.9) in people 75 and over. Antibodies were 30% less likely to be detected in men than women (adjusted OR 0.69, 0.68-0.70), and were higher in people of Asian (OR 1.67 [1.58-1.77]), Black (1.55 [1.41-1.69]), mixed 1.17 [1.06-1.29] and other (1.37 [1.23-1.51]) ethnicities compared with white ethnicity. Workers in hospitality (OR 0.69 [0.63-0.74]) and retail (0.71 [0.67-0.75]) were less likely to have antibodies. Following two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, antibody positivity (adjusted for test performance) was 100% (100-100) at all ages except 80 years and older when it was 97.8% (95.9-99.6). For AstraZeneca positivity was over 90% up to age 69, and then 89.2% (88.5-89.9) in 70-79 year olds and 83.6% (78.5-88.3) in those aged 80 and over. Following a single dose of Pfizer-BioNTech positivity ranged from 100.0% (91.1-100.0) in those aged 18-29 to 32.2% (18.2-51.1) in those aged 70-79 years. For AstraZeneca this was 72.2% (68.5-75.9) in the youngest and 46.2% (40.0-52.7) in the oldest age group. <h4>Discussion</h4> The successful roll out of the vaccination programme in England has led to a high proportion of individuals having detectable antibodies, particularly in older age groups and those who have had two doses of vaccine. This is likely to be associated with high levels of protection from severe disease, and possibly from infection. Nonetheless, there remain some key groups with a lower prevalence of antibody, notably unvaccinated younger people, certain minority ethnic groups, those living in deprived areas and workers in some public facing employment. Obtaining improved rates of vaccination in these groups is essential to achieving high levels of protection against the virus through population immunity. <h4>Funding</h4> Department of Health and Social Care in England.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/07/18/2021.07.14.21260497.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.14.21260497; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR371282; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR371282&type=FILE&fileName=EMS130807-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

The exposure was SARS-CoV-2 infection defined by ICD-10 codes. The primary outcome measure was 90-day in-hospital mortality. Data were analysed using multivariable logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, Charlson co-morbidity index, index of multiple deprivation, presence of cancer, surgical procedure type and admission acuity. Results are presented as n (%) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals. <h4>Results</h4> We identified 1,972,153 patients undergoing surgery of whom 11,940 (0.6%) had SARS-CoV-2. In total, 19,100 (1.0%) patients died in hospital. SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a much greater risk of death (SARS-CoV-2: 2,618/11,940 [21.9%] vs No SARS-CoV-2: 16,482/1,960,213 [0.8%]; OR: 5.8 [5.5 – 6.1]; p<0.001). Amongst patients undergoing elective surgery 1,030/1,374,985 (0.1%) had SARS-CoV-2 of whom 83/1,030 (8.1%) died, compared with 1,092/1,373,955 (0.1%) patients without SARS-CoV-2 (OR: 29.0 [22.5 −37.3]; p<0.001).

However, the high mortality amongst patients with SARS-CoV-2 suggests these precautions cannot be safely relaxed. <h4>Summary boxes</h4> <h4>What is already known on this topic</h4> High mortality rates have been reported amongst surgical patients who develop COVID-19 but we don’t know how this compares to the concurrent surgical population unaffected by COVID-19. Strict infection prevention and control procedures have substantially reduced the capacity of surgical treatment pathways in many hospitals. The very large backlog in delayed and cancelled surgical procedures is a growing public health concern. <h4>What this study adds</h4> Fewer than 1 in 100 surgical patients are affected by COVID-19 in the English National Health Service. Elective surgical patients who do develop COVID-19 are 30 times more likely to die while in hospital. Infection prevention and control procedures in NHS surgical pathways are highly effective but cannot be safely relaxed.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/02/20/2021.02.17.21251928.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.17.21251928; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR286480; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR286480&type=FILE&fileName=EMS117258-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Recovery status, symptoms, quality of life, impaired daily activities, hospitalization and death were ascertained via repeated self-completed questionnaires, at 6, 12 and 18-months follow-up, and linkage to hospitalization and death records.RESULTSThe cohort comprised 31,486 symptomatic and 1,795 asymptomatic infected individuals, and 62,957 never infected individuals. Of the former, 1,856 (6%) had not recovered and 13,350 (42%) only partially. Lack of recovery was associated with severe (hospitalized) infection, older age, female sex, deprivation, respiratory disease, depression and multimorbidity. Twenty-four persistent symptoms were independently associated with previous infection including breathlessness (OR 3.44, 95% CI 3.29–3.59), palpitations (OR 2.51, OR 2.37–2.67), chest pain (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.97–2.24), and confusion (OR 2.93, 95% CI 2.78–3.08). Pre-infection vaccination was associated with reduced risk of seven symptoms. Previous symptomatic infection was also associated with poorer quality of life (EQ-5D median 75 vs 80, p < 0.001) and impairment across all daily activities. Asymptomatic infection was not associated with adverse outcomes.CONCLUSIONSThe sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection are wide-ranging and not explained by confounding.

However, previous studies have been contradictory. We aimed to determine whether immunocompromised patients were at greater risk of in-hospital death, and how this risk changed over the pandemic. <h4>Methods</h4> We included patients >=19yrs with symptomatic community-acquired COVID-19 recruited to the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK. We defined immunocompromise as: immunosuppressant medication preadmission, cancer treatment, organ transplant, HIV, or congenital immunodeficiency. We used logistic regression to compare the risk of death in both groups, adjusting for age, sex, deprivation, ethnicity, vaccination and co-morbidities. We used Bayesian logistic regression to explore mortality over time. <h4>Findings</h4> Between 17/01/2020 and 28/02/2022 we recruited 156,552 eligible patients, of whom 21,954 (14%) were immunocompromised. 29% (n=6,499) of immunocompromised and 21% (n=28,608) of immunocompetent patients died in hospital. The odds of in-hospital mortality were elevated for immunocompromised patients (adjOR 1.44, 95% CI 1.39-1.50, p<0.001).

However, its impact on the NHS remains to be determined. <h4>Objective</h4> This study aims to assess the healthcare utilisation of individuals with long COVID. <h4>Methods</h4> With the approval of NHS England, we conducted a matched cohort study using primary and secondary care data via OpenSAFELY, a platform for analysing anonymous electronic health records. The long COVID exposure group, defined by diagnostic codes, was matched with five comparators without long COVID between Nov 2020 and Jan 2023. We compared their total healthcare utilisation from GP consultations, prescriptions, hospital admissions, A&E visits, and outpatient appointments. Healthcare utilisation and costs were evaluated using a two-part model adjusting for covariates.

In the 12 months post-diagnosis, there was strong evidence that those with long COVID were more likely to use healthcare resources (OR: 8.07, 95% CI: 7.54 – 8.64), and have 49% more healthcare utilisation (RR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.47 – 1.50).

Sites each had a 4-week baseline data-collection period, followed by intervention periods comprising 8 weeks of ‘rapid’ (<48h) and 4 weeks of ‘longer-turnaround’ (5-10 day) sequencing using a sequence reporting tool (SRT). Data were collected on all hospital onset COVID-19 infections (HOCIs; detected ≥48h from admission).

Infections were doubling every 9.0 (6.1, 18) days with a national reproduction number (R) estimated at 1.56 (1.27, 1.88) compared to 1.16 (1.05, 1.27) in the previous round. Prevalence of infection was highest in Yorkshire and The Humber at 2.72% (2.12%, 3.50%), up from 0.84% (0.60%, 1.17%), and the North West at 2.27% (1.90%, 2.72%), up from 1.21% (1.01%, 1.46%), and lowest in South East at 0.55% (0.45%, 0.68%), up from 0.29% (0.23%, 0.37%). Clustering of cases was more prevalent in Lancashire, Manchester, Liverpool and West Yorkshire, West Midlands and East Midlands. Interim estimates of R were above 2 in the South East, East of England, London and South West, but with wide confidence intervals. Nationally, prevalence increased across all age groups with the greatest increase in those aged 55-64 at 1.20% (0.99%, 1.46%), up 3-fold from 0.37% (0.30%, 0.46%). In those aged over 65, prevalence was 0.81% (0.58%, 0.96%) up 2-fold from 0.35% (0.28%, 0.43%). Prevalence remained highest in 18 to 24-year olds at 2.25% (1.47%, 3.42%). <h4>Conclusion</h4> The co-occurrence of high prevalence and rapid growth means that the second wave of the epidemic in England has now reached a critical stage. Whether via regional or national measures, it is now time-critical to control the virus and turn R below one if further hospital admissions and deaths from COVID-19 are to be avoided.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/11/03/2020.10.30.20223123.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.30.20223123; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR233362; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR233362&type=FILE&fileName=EMS103475-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We interviewed various healthcare professionals (HCPs) with direct experience of using WGS in hospitals (within the COG-UK Hospital Onset COVID-19 Infection (HOCI) study) to explore its acceptability and future use. <h4>Method</h4> An exploratory, cross-sectional, qualitative design employed semi-structured interviews with 39 diverse HCPs between December 2020 and June 2021. Participants were recruited from five sites within the larger clinical study of a novel genome sequencing reporting tool for SARS-CoV-2 (the HOCI study). All had experience, in their diverse roles, of using sequencing data to manage nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Deductive and inductive thematic analysis identified themes exploring aspects of the acceptability of sequencing. <h4>Findings</h4> The analysis highlighted the overall acceptability of rapid WGS for infectious disease using SARS-CoV-2 as a case study. Diverse professionals were largely very positive about its future use and believed that it could become a valuable and routine tool for managing HCAIs. We identified three key themes ‘1) ‘Proof of concept achieved’; 2) ‘Novel insights and implications’; and 3) ‘Challenges and demands’. <h4>Conclusion</h4> Our qualitative analysis, drawn from five diverse hospitals, shows the broad acceptability of rapid sequencing and its potential. Participants believed it could and should become an everyday technology capable of being embedded within typical hospital processes and systems. However, its future integration into existing healthcare systems will not be without challenges (e.g., resource, multi-level change) warranting further mixed methods research.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/06/16/2022.06.15.22276423.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.15.22276423; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR506599; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR506599&type=FILE&fileName=EMS146081-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

In an attempt to reduce admissions and enable safe early discharge, a COVID virtual ward (CVW) care pathway has been supported by NHS England. This includes discharging people who meet objective criteria based on acuity scores and oxygen saturations, with pulse oximeters and daily phone calls for up to 14 days. Observational studies have reported the safety of this system, but without describing the outcomes from usual care. <h4>Methods</h4> A retrospective study using routinely collected health data from all adults with a confirmed positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) swab result between 1 st June 2020 and 31 st Jan 2021 who attended the Emergency Department or Acute Medical Unit at QEHB, which does not have a CVW service. Criteria for CVW were applied using data from the first 24 hours of presentation to hospital and subsequent health outcomes were included for 28 days, including re-presentation, re-admission, ITU escalation and death. Results were compared to reported studies based in secondary care. <h4>Results</h4> During the study period, 26,127 patients presented to QEHB hospital. 2301 had a positive SARS-CoV-2 swab. Of these, 1730 (75.2%) did not meet the criteria for the CVW and 571 (24.8%) did. Of the 571, 325 (56.9%) were discharged home within 24 hours and 246 (43.1%) were admitted for 24 hours or longer. Those admitted were older, with increased co-morbidities, 80.9% required hospital-supported acute therapies after the first 24 hours and 10.6% died. Of the 325 discharged, 44 were readmitted (13.5%), 30 (9.2%) with COVID-related symptoms, 5 (1.5%) required ITU and 1 patient (0.3%) died. These results were comparable to published studies with a CVW service. <h4>Discussion</h4> In the current study, discharging patients without a CVW did not confer a greater risk of re-presentation, re-admission, ITU escalation or death. The majority of patients who remained in hospital despite meeting the CVW criteria did so for the provision of treatments or acute assessments. It remains uncertain whether a CVW delivers improvements in hard outcomes, and further research is needed.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/07/20/2021.07.16.21260651.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.16.21260651; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR372315; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR372315&type=FILE&fileName=EMS131153-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We estimated protective effects of the first dose of ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 vaccines against infection in this population. <h4>Methods</h4> Cohort study comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated LTCF residents in England, undergoing routine asymptomatic testing (8 December 2020 - 15 March 2021). We estimated the relative hazard of PCR-positive infection using Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusting for age, sex, prior infection, local SARS-CoV-2 incidence, LTCF bed capacity, and clustering by LTCF. <h4>Results</h4> Of 10,412 residents (median age 86 years) from 310 LTCFs, 9,160 were vaccinated with either ChAdOx1 (6,138; 67%) or BNT162b2 (3,022; 33%) vaccines. A total of 670,628 person days and 1,335 PCR-positive infections were included. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for PCR-positive infection relative to unvaccinated residents declined from 28 days following the first vaccine dose to 0·44 (0·24, 0·81) at 28-34 days and 0·38 (0·19, 0·77) at 35-48 days. Similar effect sizes were seen for ChAdOx1 (aHR 0·32 [0·15-0·66] and BNT162b2 (aHR 0·35 [0·17, 0·71]) vaccines at 35-48 days. Mean PCR cycle threshold values were higher, implying lower infectivity, for infections ≥28 days post-vaccination compared with those prior to vaccination (31·3 vs 26·6, p<0·001). <h4>Interpretation</h4> The first dose of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines was associated with substantially reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection risk in LTCF residents from 4 weeks to at least 7 weeks. <h4>Funding</h4> UK Government Department of Health and Social Care. <h4>Research in Context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We conducted a systematic search for studies which evaluated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine effectiveness in residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) published between 01/01/2020 and 11/03/2021. We used variations of search terms for “COVID-19” AND “vaccine effectiveness” OR “vaccine efficacy” AND “care homes” OR “long term care facilities” OR “older people” on Ovid MEDLINE and MedRxiv. We identified one pre-print article regarding LTCFs in Denmark, which reported that a single dose of BNT162b was ineffective against SARS-CoV-2 infection in residents, however, participants received the second vaccine dose 24 days following the first dose on average, which is likely to be too soon to capture the protective effects of a single vaccine dose. Additionally, we identified two pre-print reports of studies evaluating vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection and hospitalisation amongst older adults in the community. The first of these found 81% vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-related hospitalisation at 28-34 days following a single dose of BNT162b or ChAdOx1 in ≥80-year-olds. The second of these found vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection of 60% at 28-34 days and 73% at 35+ days following a single dose of ChAdOx1 in ≥70-year-olds. No studies were identified that focused on the effectiveness of a single vaccine dose against infection amongst LTCF residents at more than 4 weeks post-vaccination, a particularly important question in the context of the UK policy decision to extend the dose interval beyond 3 weeks. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> We conducted a prospective cohort study of 10,412 residents aged ≥65 years, from 310 LTCFs across England, to investigate the protective effect of the first dose of the ChAdOx1 and BNT162b vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection in frail older adults. We retrieved results from routine monthly PCR testing, as well as outbreak and clinical testing for SARS-CoV-2, thereby capturing data on asymptomatic as well as symptomatic infections, which we linked to vaccination records. We estimated vaccine effectiveness to be 56% (19-76%) at 28-34 days, and 62% (23-81%) at 35-48 days following a single dose of ChAdOx1 or BNT162. Our findings suggest that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection is substantially reduced from 28 days following the first dose of either vaccine and that this effect is maintained for at least 7 weeks, with similar protection offered by both vaccine types. We also found that PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values, which are negatively associated with the ability to isolate virus, were significantly higher in infections occurring at ≥ 28days post vaccination compared to those occurring in the unvaccinated period, suggesting that vaccination may reduce onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in breakthrough infections. To the best of our knowledge, our findings constitute the first real-world evidence on vaccine effectiveness against infection for ChAdOx1, in any age group. We can also infer that both vaccines are effective against the B.1.1.7 variant, because our analysis period coincided with the rapid emergence of B.1.1.7 in England during the second wave of the pandemic. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Our findings add to the growing body of evidence on the protective effect of the BNT162b vaccines in residents of LTCFs and demonstrate the effectiveness of ChAdOx1 in this vulnerable population. Evaluating single-dose vaccine efficacy has become increasingly important in light of extended dosing intervals that have been implemented in order to maximise vaccine coverage across high-risk groups. Further work is required to evaluate the effectiveness of the first vaccine dose after 8-12 weeks, as well as following the second dose, and to evaluate the long-term impact of vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 infection, transmission and mortality in LTCFs. This will inform policy decisions regarding the ongoing need for disease control measures in LTCF such as visitor restrictions, which continue to have a detrimental impact on the wellbeing of residents, their relatives, and staff.

Direct comparisons of the effectiveness against severe COVID-19 of these two vaccines for boosting have not been made in trials or observational data. <h4>Methods</h4> On behalf of NHS England, we used the OpenSAFELY-TPP database to match adult recipients of each vaccine type on date of vaccination, primary vaccine course, age, and other characteristics. Recipients were eligible if boosted between 29 October 2021 and 31 January 2022, and followed up for 12 weeks. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test, COVID-19 hospitalisation, and COVID-19 death. We estimated the cumulative incidence of each outcome, and quantified comparative effectiveness using risk differences (RD) and hazard ratios (HRs). <h4>Results</h4> 1,528,431 people were matched in each group, contributing a total 23,150,504 person-weeks of follow-up. The 12-week risks per 1,000 people of positive SARS-CoV-2 test were 103.2 (95%CI 102.4 to 104.0) for BNT162b2 and 96.0 (95.2 to 96.8) for mRNA-1273: the HR comparing mRNA-1273 with BNT162b2 was 0.92 (95%CI 0.91 to 0.92). For COVID-19 hospitalisations the 12-week risks per 1,000 were 0.65 (95%CI 0.56 to 0.75) and 0.44 (0.36 to 0.54): HR 0.67 (95%CI 0.58 to 0.78).

Patients diagnosed with Long COVID (3,871) and those with World Health Organisation (WHO) defined symptoms of long COVID (30,174) formed two subgroups within the cohort with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. <h4>Main outcome measures</h4> Costs were calculated using a bottom-up costing approach with consultation cost per working hour in pound sterling (£) obtained from the Personal Social Services Research Unit’s Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2021. The average incremental cost in comparison to patients with no record of COVID-19 was produced for each patient group, considering only consultation costs at least 12 weeks from the SARS-CoV-2 infection date or matched date for the comparator group (from 15 th April 2020 to 15 th April 2021). A sensitivity analysis was undertaken which restricted the study population to only those who had at least 24 weeks of follow-up. National costs were estimated by extrapolating incremental costs to the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the UK Office for National Statistics COVID-19 Infection Survey. The impacts of risk factors on the cost of consultations beyond 12 weeks from SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed using an econometric ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model, where coefficients were interpreted as the percentage change in cost due to a unit increase in the specific factor. <h4>Results</h4> The incremental cost of primary care consultations potentially associated with long COVID was £2.44 per patient with COVID-19 per year. This increased to £5.72 in the sensitivity analysis. Extrapolating this to the UK population produced a cost estimate of £23,382,452 (90% credible interval: £21,378,567 to £25,526,052) or £54,814,601 (90% credible interval: £50,116,967 to £59,839,762) in the sensitivity analysis. Among patients with COVID-19 infection, a long COVID diagnosis and longer-term reporting of symptoms were associated with a 43% and 44% increase in primary care consultation costs respectively, compared to patients without long COVID symptoms. Older age (49% relative increase in costs in those aged 80 years or older compared to those aged 18 to 29 years), female sex (4% relative increase in costs compared to males), obesity (4% relative increase in costs compared to those of normal weight), comorbidities and the number of prior consultations were all associated with an increase in the cost of primary care consultations. By contrast, those from black ethnic groups had a 6% reduced relative cost compared to those from white ethnic groups. <h4>Conclusions</h4> The costs of primary care consultations associated with long COVID in non-hospitalised adults are substantial. Costs are significantly higher among those diagnosed with long COVID, those with long COVID symptoms, older adults, females, and those with obesity and comorbidities. <h4>What is already known on this topic?</h4> Long COVID is a global public health challenge, with millions of people affected worldwide. People with a history of long COVID use health services, including primary care, at a higher rate than uninfected individuals even beyond the period of acute infection. The cost of this increased healthcare use is unknown, impeding planning and forecasting of resource requirements needed to adequately support people with long COVID. <h4>What this study adds?</h4> Beyond 12 weeks from acute infection, non-hospitalised adults with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection cost primary care services an additional £2.44 per patient per year greater on average than patients with no prior evidence of infection. Due to the high incidence of COVID-19, this represents a substantial cost to primary care services, in the UK exceeding £20 million for consultations associated with long COVID. These incremental costs are greater in those with a formal diagnosis of long COVID, those reporting related symptoms, older adults, females, and those with obesity.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/03/14/2023.03.12.23287049.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.12.23287049; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR629959; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR629959&type=FILE&fileName=EMS172338-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We report a conformation in which the trimer is ‘locked’ into a compact well-ordered form. This differs from previous structures where the RBD can flip up to recognise the receptor. In the ‘locked’ form regions associated with fusion transitions are stabilised and the RBD harbours curved lipids. The acyl chains bind a hydrophobic pocket in one RBD whilst the polar headgroups attach to an adjacent RBD of the trimer. By functional analogy with enteroviral pocket factors loss of the lipid would destabilise the ‘locked’ form facilitating receptor attachment, conversion to the postfusion state and virus infection. The nature of lipids available at the site of infection might affect the antigenicity/pathogenicity of released virus. These results reveal a potentially druggable pocket and suggest that the natural prefusion state occludes neutralising RBD epitopes, achieving conformational shielding from antibodies. <h4>Highlights</h4> SARS-CoV-2 Spike can adopt a ‘locked’ conformation with all receptor binding domains (RBDs) down, likely to represent the prefusion resting state This ‘locked’ conformation is compact and stable, braced by lipid bound within a potentially druggable pocket Key neutralization epitopes are shielded in the ‘locked’ form Loss of lipid may trigger a cascade of events that lead to cell entry analogous to the role of lipids in enterovirus cell entry",,pdf:https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/08/13/2020.08.13.249177.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.13.249177; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR200879; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR200879&type=FILE&fileName=EMS92959-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Even though safe and effective vaccines are being deployed in many populations, the majority of those most at-risk of severe COVID-19 will not be protected until late spring, even in countries already at a more advanced stage of vaccine deployment. <h4>Methods</h4> The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission study-1 (REACT-1) obtains throat and nose swabs from between 120,000 and 180,000 people in the community in England at approximately monthly intervals. Round 8a of REACT-1 mainly covers a period from 6th January 2021 to 15th January 2021. Swabs are tested for SARS-CoV-2 virus and patterns of swab-positivity are described over time, space and with respect to individual characteristics. We compare swab-positivity prevalence from REACT-1 with mobility data based on the GPS locations of individuals using the Facebook mobile phone app. We also compare results from round 8a with those from round 7 in which swabs were collected from 13th November to 24th November (round 7a) and 25th November to 3rd December 2020 (round 7b). <h4>Results</h4> In round 8a, we found 1,962 positives from 142,909 swabs giving a weighted prevalence of 1.58% (95% CI, 1.49%, 1.68%). Using a constant growth model, we found no strong evidence for either growth or decay averaged across the period; rather, based on data from a limited number of days, prevalence may have started to rise at the end of round 8a. Facebook mobility data showed a marked decrease in activity at the end of December 2020, followed by a rise at the start of the working year in January 2021. Between round 7b and round 8a, prevalence increased in all adult age groups, more than doubling to 0.94% (0.83%, 1.07%) in those aged 65 and over. Large household size, living in a deprived neighbourhood, and Black and Asian ethnicity were all associated with increased prevalence. Both healthcare and care home workers, and other key workers, had increased odds of swab-positivity compared to other workers. <h4>Conclusion</h4> During the initial 10 days of the third COVID-19 lockdown in England in January 2021, prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was very high with no evidence of decline. Until prevalence in the community is reduced substantially, health services will remain under extreme pressure and the cumulative number of lives lost during this pandemic will continue to increase rapidly.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/01/22/2021.01.20.21250158.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.20.21250158; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR271404; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR271404&type=FILE&fileName=EMS113524-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We studied nasal and plasma antibody responses one year after hospitalisation for COVID-19, including a period when SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was introduced. <h4>Methods</h4> Plasma and nasosorption samples were prospectively collected from 446 adults hospitalised for COVID-19 between February 2020 and March 2021 via the ISARIC4C and PHOSP-COVID consortia. IgA and IgG responses to NP and S of ancestral SARS-CoV-2, Delta and Omicron (BA.1) variants were measured by electrochemiluminescence and compared with plasma neutralisation data. <h4>Findings</h4> Strong and consistent nasal anti-NP and anti-S IgA responses were demonstrated, which remained elevated for nine months. Nasal and plasma anti-S IgG remained elevated for at least 12 months with high plasma neutralising titres against all variants. Of 180 with complete data, 160 were vaccinated between 6 and 12 months; coinciding with rises in nasal and plasma IgA and IgG anti-S titres for all SARS-CoV-2 variants, although the change in nasal IgA was minimal. Samples 12 months after admission showed no association between nasal IgA and plasma IgG responses, indicating that nasal IgA responses are distinct from those in plasma and minimally boosted by vaccination. <h4>Interpretation</h4> The decline in nasal IgA responses 9 months after infection and minimal impact of subsequent vaccination may explain the lack of long-lasting nasal defence against reinfection and the limited effects of vaccination on transmission. These findings highlight the need to develop vaccines that enhance nasal immunity. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before the study</h4> While systemic immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is important in preventing severe disease, mucosal immunity prevents viral replication at the point of entry and reduces onward transmission. We searched PubMed with search terms “mucosal”, “nasal”, “antibody”, “IgA”, “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “convalescent” and “vaccination” for studies published in English before 20 th July 2022, identifying three previous studies examining the durability of nasal responses that generally show nasal antibody to persist for 3 to 9 months. However, these studies were small or included individuals with mild COVID-19. One study of 107 care-home residents demonstrated increased salivary IgG (but not IgA) after two doses of mRNA vaccine, and another examined nasal antibody responses after infection and subsequent vaccination in 20 cases, demonstrating rises in both nasal IgA and IgG 7 to 10 days after vaccination. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> Studying 446 people hospitalised for COVID-19, we show durable nasal and plasma IgG responses to ancestral (B.1 lineage) SARS-CoV-2, Delta and Omicron (BA.1) variants up to 12 months after infection. Nasal antibody induced by infection with pre-Omicron variants, bind Omicron virus in vitro better than plasma antibody. Although nasal and plasma IgG responses were enhanced by vaccination, Omicron binding responses did not reach levels equivalent to responses for ancestral SARS-CoV-2. Using paired plasma and nasal samples collected approximately 12 months after infection, we show that nasal IgA declines and shows a minimal response to vaccination whilst plasma antibody responses to S antigen are well maintained and boosted by vaccination. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> After COVID-19 and subsequent vaccination, Omicron binding plasma and nasal antibody responses are only moderately enhanced, supporting the need for booster vaccinations to maintain immunity against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Notably, there is distinct compartmentalisation between nasal IgA and plasma IgA and IgG responses after vaccination. These findings highlight the need for vaccines that induce robust and durable mucosal immunity.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/09/09/2022.09.09.22279759.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.09.09.22279759; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR542738; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR542738&type=FILE&fileName=EMS154137-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Among infants born to women with confirmed infection around the time of birth, the infection rate was 1,811 per 100,000 live births (15/828). Nearly two-thirds (92/141, 65.2%) of babies with confirmed neonatal infection had an associated admission to neonatal or (more commonly) paediatric care. Of those admitted to hospital, 6/92 (6.5%) infants were admitted to neonatal or paediatric intensive care, however none of these six had COVID-19 recorded as the main diagnosis underlying their admission. There were no neonatal deaths among babies with confirmed infection. <h4>Implications and relevance</h4> Confirmed neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection is uncommon. Secular trends in the neonatal infection rate broadly follow those seen in the general population, albeit at a lower level. Maternal infection at birth increases the risk of neonatal infection, but most babies with neonatal infection are born to women without confirmed infection. A high proportion of neonates with confirmed infection are admitted to hospital, with resulting implications for the baby, family, and services, although their outcomes are generally good. <h4>Key messages</h4> <h4>What is already known on this topic</h4> The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates is low, but some studies have suggested that age under 1 month is a risk factor for severe infection requiring admission to intensive care. Almost all the studies of neonatal SARS-CoV-2 have focused on the transmission risk from SARS-CoV-2 positive women to their offspring and data are lacking on the level of neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection in the whole population. <h4>What this study adds</h4> This study includes all babies with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in the neonatal period in Scotland during the first 22 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Confirmed neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection is uncommon, but a high proportion of neonates with confirmed infection are admitted to hospital. Confirmed maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection around the time of birth substantially increases the risk of neonatal infection, although the absolute risk of neonatal infection remains low (<2%) and most babies with neonatal infection are born to women without confirmed infection. Outcomes for neonates with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection are good; only 6.5% (6/92) of admitted neonates required intensive care, and COVID-19 was not the primary diagnosis recorded for these babies.

The increased risk for South Asian ethnicity, patients with pre-existing non-malignant pancreatic or liver conditions, and age>70 years seemed to be due to underlying comorbidities in these particular groups.

The high risk associated with past smokers was largely associated with co-existing respiratory or cardiovascular diseases; surprisingly current smokers were associated with a lower risk of infection (RR=0·58 [0·35–0·93]). HPB patients on current or past Vitamin D treatment were at increased risk of COVID-19 (RR= 2·26 [1·6–3·12] and 2·55[1·55–3·95], respectively). Black ethnicity was at increased mortality risk (RR=2.4 [1·35–3·48]).

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of REGEN-COV in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. <h4>Methods</h4> In this randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial, several possible treatments were compared with usual care in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to either usual standard of care alone (usual care group) or usual care plus a single dose of REGEN-COV 8g (casirivimab 4g and imdevimab 4g) by intravenous infusion (REGEN-COV group). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality assessed first among patients without detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at randomisation (seronegative) and then in the overall population. The trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT04381936 ). <h4>Findings</h4> Between 18 September 2020 and 22 May 2021, 9785 patients were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus REGEN-COV or usual care alone, including 3153 (32%) seronegative patients, 5272 (54%) seropositive patients and 1360 (14%) patients with unknown baseline antibody status. In the primary efficacy population of seronegative patients, 396 (24%) of 1633 patients allocated to REGEN-COV and 451 (30%) of 1520 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0·80; 95% CI 0·70-0·91; p=0·0010). In an analysis involving all randomised patients (regardless of baseline antibody status), 944 (20%) of 4839 patients allocated to REGEN-COV and 1026 (21%) of 4946 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0·94; 95% CI 0·86-1·03; p=0·17). The proportional effect of REGEN-COV on mortality differed significantly between seropositive and seronegative patients (p value for heterogeneity = 0·001). <h4>Interpretation</h4> In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, the monoclonal antibody combination of casirivimab and imdevimab (REGEN-COV) reduced 28-day mortality among patients who were seronegative at baseline. <h4>Funding</h4> UK Research and Innovation (Medical Research Council) and National Institute of Health Research (Grant ref: MC_PC_19056).",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/06/16/2021.06.15.21258542.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.15.21258542; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR357531; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR357531&type=FILE&fileName=EMS127953-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

For model development, we predicted excess deaths using baseline one-year all-cause mortality risk and assumed RR=3 and IR=10%. For model validation, we observed number of excess deaths from March 2020 to March 2021. We used baseline mortality risk, IR and RR (assumed and observed) to predict excess deaths related to COVID-19.   <br><br>Findings: Among individuals with at least one high-risk condition, baseline (pre-pandemic) 1-year mortality risk at one year was 4·46% (95% CI 4·41–4·51) and 3.55% (3.54-3.57) in development and validation cohorts, respectively. In our original published model, we predicted 73,498 COVID-19 deaths over 1 year for the population of England. From 1st March 2020 to 1st March 2021, there were 127,020 observed excess deaths. Observed RR was 4·34 (4·31-4·38, 95% CI) and IR was 6·27% (6·26-6·28, 95%CI). In the validation cohort, predicted excess deaths over one year were 100,338 compared with the observed 127,020 deaths with a ratio of predicted to observed excess deaths of 0.79.

A laboratory comparison of LFIA results to neutralization activity in panel of sera was performed. <h4>Results</h4> There were 17,576 positive tests over the three rounds.

There were substantial falls in weighted regional prevalence: in South East from 0.36% (0.29%, 0.44%) in round 9 to 0.07% (0.04%, 0.12%) in round 10; London from 0.60% (0.48%, 0.76%) to 0.16% (0.10%, 0.26%); East of England from 0.47% (0.36%, 0.60%) to 0.15% (0.10%, 0.24%); East Midlands from 0.59% (0.45%, 0.77%) to 0.19% (0.13%, 0.28%); and North West from 0.69% (0.54%, 0.88%) to 0.31% (0.21%, 0.45%). Areas of apparent higher prevalence remain in parts of the North West, and Yorkshire and The Humber. The highest prevalence in March was found among school-aged children 5 to 12 years at 0.41% (0.27%, 0.62%), compared with the lowest in those aged 65 to 74 and 75 and over at 0.09% (0.05%, 0.16%). The close approximation between prevalence of infections and deaths (suitably lagged) is diverging, suggesting that infections may have resulted in fewer hospitalisations and deaths since the start of widespread vaccination. <h4>Conclusion</h4> We report a sharp decline in prevalence of infections between February and March 2021. We did not observe an increase in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 following the reopening of schools in England, although the decline of prevalence appears to have stopped. Future rounds of REACT-1 will be able to measure the rate of growth or decline from this current plateau and hence help assess the effectiveness of the vaccination roll-out on transmission of the virus as well as the potential size of any third wave during the ensuing months.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/04/15/2021.04.08.21255100.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.08.21255100; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR312539; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR312539&type=FILE&fileName=EMS122836-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Prior results showed that prevalence dropped during the first half of lockdown, with greater reductions in higher-prevalence northern regions.  Methods REACT-1 is a series of community surveys of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR swab-positivity in England, designed to monitor the spread of the epidemic and thus increase situational awareness. Round 7 of REACT-1 commenced swab-collection on 13th November 2020. A prior interim report included data from 13th to 24th November 2020 for 105,122 participants. Here, we report data for the entire round with swab results obtained up to 3rd December 2020.  Results Between 13th November and 3rd December (round 7) there were 1,299 positive swabs out of 168,181 giving a weighted prevalence of 0.94% (95% CI 0.87%, 1.01%) or 94 per 10,000 people infected in the community in England. This compares with a prevalence of 1.30% (1.21%, 1.39%) from 16th October to 2nd November 2020 (round 6), a decline of 28%. Prevalence during the latter half of round 7 was 0.91% (95% CI, 0.81%, 1.03%) compared with 0.96% (0.87%, 1.05%) in the first half. The national R number in round 7 was estimated at 0.96 (0.88, 1.03) with a decline in prevalence observed during the first half of this period no longer apparent during the second half at the end of lockdown. During round 7 there was a marked fall in prevalence in West Midlands, a levelling off in some regions and a rise in London. R numbers at regional level ranged from 0.60 (0.41, 0.80) in West Midlands up to 1.27 (1.04, 1.54) in London, where prevalence was highest in the east and south-east of the city. Nationally, between 13th November and 3rd December, the highest prevalence was in school-aged children especially at ages 13-17 years at 2.04% (1.69%, 2.46%), or approximately 1 in 50.  Conclusion Between the previous round and round 7 (during lockdown), there was a fall in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 swab-positivity nationally, but it did not fall uniformly over time or by geography.

As vaccination programs roll out globally and social distancing is relaxed, future SARS-CoV-2 trends are uncertain. <h4>Methods</h4> We analysed prevalence trends and their drivers using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swab-positivity data from round 12 (between 20 May and 7 June 2021) and round 13 (between 24 June and 12 July 2021) of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study, with swabs sent to non-overlapping random samples of the population ages 5 years and over in England. <h4>Results</h4> We observed sustained exponential growth with an average doubling time in round 13 of 25 days (lower Credible Interval of 15 days) and an increase in average prevalence from 0.15% (0.12%, 0.18%) in round 12 to 0.63% (0.57%, 0.18%) in round 13. The rapid growth across and within rounds appears to have been driven by complete replacement of Alpha variant by Delta, and by the high prevalence in younger less-vaccinated age groups, with a nine-fold increase between rounds 12 and 13 among those aged 13 to 17 years. Prevalence among those who reported being unvaccinated was three-fold higher than those who reported being fully vaccinated. However, in round 13, 44% of infections occurred in fully vaccinated individuals, reflecting imperfect vaccine effectiveness against infection despite high overall levels of vaccination. Using self-reported vaccination status, we estimated adjusted vaccine effectiveness against infection in round 13 of 49% (22%, 67%) among participants aged 18 to 64 years, which rose to 58% (33%, 73%) when considering only strong positives (Cycle threshold [Ct] values < 27); also, we estimated adjusted vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection of 59% (23%, 78%), with any one of three common COVID-19 symptoms reported in the month prior to swabbing. Sex (round 13 only), ethnicity, household size and local levels of deprivation jointly contributed to the risk of higher prevalence of swab-positivity. <h4>Discussion</h4> From end May to beginning July 2021 in England, where there has been a highly successful vaccination campaign with high vaccine uptake, infections were increasing exponentially driven by the Delta variant and high infection prevalence among younger, unvaccinated individuals despite double vaccination continuing to effectively reduce transmission. Although slower growth or declining prevalence may be observed during the summer in the northern hemisphere, increased mixing during the autumn in the presence of the Delta variant may lead to renewed growth, even at high levels of vaccination.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/09/10/2021.09.02.21262979.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.02.21262979; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR393002; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR393002&type=FILE&fileName=EMS134814-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

The BNT162b2 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was used initially, with Moderna mRNA-1273 subsequently also used. <h4>Methods</h4> We used the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, covering 40% of English primary care practices and linked to national coronavirus surveillance, hospital episodes, and death registry data, to estimate the effectiveness of boosting with BNT162b2 compared with no boosting in eligible adults who had received two primary course vaccine doses between 16 September and 16 December 2021 when the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 was dominant. Follow up was for up to 10 weeks. Each booster recipient was matched with an unboosted control on factors relating to booster priority status and prior immunisation. Additional factors were adjusted for in Cox models estimating hazard ratios (HRs). Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test, COVID-19 hospitalisation, COVID-19 death and non-COVID-9 death. Booster vaccine effectiveness was defined as 1−HR. <h4>Results</h4> Among 4,352,417 BNT162b2 booster recipients matched with unboosted controls, estimated effectiveness of a booster dose compared with two doses only was 50.7% (95% CI 50.1-51.3) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 80.1% (78.3-81.8) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 88.5% (85.0-91.1) for COVID-19 death, and 80.3% (79.0-81.5) for non-COVID-19 death.

Initial reports from the early weeks of lockdown in the UK and worldwide suggested that uptake could fall putting children at risk from multiple other infectious diseases. In Scotland and England, enhanced surveillance of national data for childhood immunisations was established to inform and rapidly assess the impact of the pandemic on infant and preschool immunisation uptake rates. <h4>Methods and findings</h4> We undertook an observational study using routinely collected data for the year prior to the pandemic (2019), and immediately before, during and after the first period of the UK ‘lockdown’ in 2020. Data were obtained for Scotland from the Public Health Scotland “COVID19 wider impacts on the health care system” dashboard ( https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-covid-wider-impact/ ) and for England from ImmForm. Five vaccinations delivered at different ages were evaluated; three doses of the ‘6-in-1’ DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB vaccine and two doses of MMR. Uptake in the periods in 2020 compared to that in the baseline year of 2019 using binary logistic regression analysis. For Scotland, we analysed timely uptake of immunisations, defined as uptake within four weeks of the child becoming eligible by age for each immunisation and data were also analysed by geographical region and indices of deprivation. For both Scotland and England, we assessed whether immunisations were up to date at approximately 6 months (all doses 6-in-1) and 16-18 months (first MMR) of age. We found that uptake rates within four weeks of eligibility in Scotland for all the five vaccine visits were higher during the 2020 lockdown period than in 2019. The difference ranged from 1.3% for the first dose of the 6-in-1 vaccine (95.3 vs 94%, OR 1.28, CI 1.18-1.39) to 14.3% for the second MMR dose (66.1 vs 51.8 %, OR 1.8, CI 1.74-1.87). Significant increases in uptake were seen across all deprivation levels, though, for MMR, there was evidence of greater improvement for children living in the least deprived areas. In England, fewer children who had been due to receive their immunisations during the lockdown period were up to date at 6 months (6-in-1) or 18 months (first dose MMR). The fall in percentage uptake ranged from 0.5% for first 6-in1 (95.8 vs 96.3%, OR 0.89, CI 0.86-0.91) to 2.1% for third 6-in-1 (86.6 vs 88.7%, OR 0.82, CI 0.81-0.83). <h4>Conclusions</h4> This study suggests that the national lockdown in Scotland was associated with a positive effect on timely childhood immunisation uptake, however in England a lower percentage of children were up to date at 6 and 18 months. Reason for the improve uptake in Scotland may include active measures taken to promote immunisation at local and national level during this period.

A vaccination programme began in England in December 2020, with priority given to administering the first dose to the largest number of older individuals, healthcare and care home workers. <h4>Methods</h4> A cross-sectional community survey in England undertaken between 26 January and 8 February 2021 as the fifth round of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-2 (REACT-2) programme. Participants completed questionnaires, including demographic details and clinical and COVID-19 vaccination histories, and self-administered a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test to detect IgG against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. There were sufficient numbers of participants to analyse antibody positivity after 21 days from vaccination with the PfizerBioNTech but not the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine which was introduced slightly later. <h4>Results</h4> The survey comprised 172,099 people, with valid IgG antibody results from 155,172. The overall prevalence of antibodies (weighted to be representative of the population of England and adjusted for test sensitivity and specificity) in England was 13.9% (95% CI 13.7, 14.1) overall, 37.9% (37.2, 38.7) in vaccinated and 9.8% (9.6, 10.0) in unvaccinated people. The prevalence of antibodies (weighted) in unvaccinated people was highest in London at 16.9% (16.3, 17.5), and higher in people of Black (22.4%, 20.8, 24.1) and Asian (20.0%, 19.0, 21.0) ethnicity compared to white (8.5%, 8.3, 8.7) people. The uptake of vaccination by age was highest in those aged 80 years or older (93.5%). Vaccine confidence was high with 92.0% (91.9, 92.1) of people saying that they had accepted or intended to accept the offer. Vaccine confidence varied by age and ethnicity, with lower confidence in young people and those of Black ethnicity. Particular concerns were identified around pregnancy, fertility and allergies. In 971 individuals who received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the proportion testing positive was high across all age groups. Following a single dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine after 21 days or more, 84.1% (82.2, 85.9) of people under 60 years tested positive (unadjusted) with a decreasing trend with increasing age, but high responses to a single dose in those with confirmed or suspected prior COVID at 90.1% (87.2, 92.4) across all age groups. <h4>Conclusions</h4> There is uneven distribution of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the population with a higher burden in key workers and some minority ethnic groups, similar to the pattern in the first wave. Confidence in the vaccine programme is high overall although it was lower in some of the higher prevalence groups which suggests the need for improved communication about specific perceived risks. Two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, or a single dose following previous infection, confers high levels of antibody positivity across all ages. Further work is needed to understand the relationship between antibody positivity, clinical outcomes such as hospitalisation, and transmission.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/03/01/2021.02.26.21252512.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.26.21252512; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR290302; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR290302&type=FILE&fileName=EMS117860-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

In England, infections, hospitalisations and deaths fell during the first two steps of the “roadmap” for exiting the third national lockdown. The third step of the roadmap in England takes place on 17 May 2021. <h4>Methods</h4> We report the most recent findings on community infections from the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study in which a swab is obtained from a representative cross-sectional sample of the population in England and tested using PCR. Round 11 of REACT-1 commenced self-administered swab-collection on 15 April 2021 and completed collections on 3 May 2021. We compare the results of REACT-1 round 11 to round 10, in which swabs were collected from 11 to 30 March 2021. <h4>Results</h4> Between rounds 10 and 11, prevalence of swab-positivity dropped by 50% in England from 0.20% (0.17%, 0.23%) to 0.10% (0.08%, 0.13%), with a corresponding R estimate of 0.90 (0.87, 0.94). Rates of swab-positivity fell in the 55 to 64 year old group from 0.17% (0.12%, 0.25%) in round 10 to 0.06% (0.04%, 0.11%) in round 11. Prevalence in round 11 was higher in the 25 to 34 year old group at 0.21% (0.12%, 0.38%) than in the 55 to 64 year olds and also higher in participants of Asian ethnicity at 0.31% (0.16%, 0.60%) compared with white participants at 0.09% (0.07%, 0.11%). Based on sequence data for positive samples for which a lineage could be identified, we estimate that 92.3% (75.9%, 97.9%, n=24) of infections were from the B.1.1.7 lineage compared to 7.7% (2.1%, 24.1%, n=2) from the B.1.617.2 lineage. Both samples from the B.1.617.2 lineage were detected in London from participants not reporting travel in the previous two weeks. Also, allowing for suitable lag periods, the prior close alignment between prevalence of infections and hospitalisations and deaths nationally has diverged. <h4>Discussion</h4> We observed marked reductions in prevalence from March to April and early May 2021 in England reflecting the success of the vaccination programme and despite easing of restrictions during lockdown. However, there is potential upwards pressure on prevalence from the further easing of lockdown regulations and presence of the B.1.617.2 lineage. If prevalence rises in the coming weeks, policy-makers will need to assess the possible impact on hospitalisations and deaths. In addition, consideration should be given to other health and economic impacts if increased levels of community transmission occur.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/05/17/2021.05.13.21257144.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.13.21257144; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR340395; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR340395&type=FILE&fileName=EMS124703-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

It is unknown how UK COVID-19 ‘lockdown measures’, which led to restrictions in public movement, gatherings, in-person health service delivery, and changes to police powers, further impacted inequalities. <h4>Aims</h4> In this study, we assessed whether national ‘lockdown’ measures impacted ethnic inequalities in voluntary and compulsory psychiatric hospital admissions, during the COVID-19 pandemic. <h4>Methods</h4> Daily counts of admissions and detentions to psychiatric hospitals were extracted from a large population-level sample of secondary mental health service users in southeast London. Changes during two COVID-19 lockdown periods, over 2020-2021, were compared with pre-pandemic periods (2016-2019) with the use of a regression discontinuity in time design to assess ethnic inequalities in voluntary/ compulsory mental health admissions. <h4>Results</h4> Compared to the pre-pandemic reference (2016-2019), after adjusting for seasonal and weekly trends, overall admissions to mental health units dropped during the first COVID-19 lockdown (Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) 0.87 (95% CI: 0.75-1.00) but with more compulsory detentions (1.25 (1.05-1.54)). This was mostly due to higher compulsory detentions in the Black Caribbean group (1.54 (1.08-2.19)). During the second COVID-19 lockdown, whereas total daily admissions remained similar to the pre-pandemic reference (1.03 (0.92-1.15)), total new daily detentions was elevated (1.28 (1.11-1.49)), specifically in Black Caribbean (1.53 (1.14, 2.06)) and Black African (1.57 (1.06-2.34)) groups. <h4>Conclusions</h4> COVID-19 lockdown measures exacerbated pre-existing ethnic inequalities in compulsory psychiatric detention, particularly for those from Black Caribbean and Black African backgrounds. There is a need to address ethnic inequalities in compulsory psychiatric detentions and attend to exacerbations of pre-existing inequalities during health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic. This cannot be achieved without addressing systemic racism within criminal justice and healthcare systems and tackling inequalities in wider social and economic determinants of mental health. <h4>Funding</h4> Health Foundation, NIHR, UKRI.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2025/05/06/2025.05.02.25326888.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.02.25326888; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR1013794; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR1013794&type=FILE&fileName=EMS205288-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

High prevalence was first observed at younger adult ages before spreading out to school-aged children and older adults. Local tiered interventions were in place up to 5th November 2020 at which time a second national lockdown was implemented. <h4>Methods</h4> REACT-1 is a repeated cross-sectional survey of SARS-CoV-2 swab-positivity in random samples of the population of England. The current period of data collection (round 7) commenced on 13th November 2020 and we report interim results here for swabs collected up to and including 24th November 2020. Because there were two distinct periods of growth during the previous round 6, here we compare results from round 7 (mainly) with the second half of round 6, which obtained swabs between 26th October and 2nd November 2020. We report prevalence both unweighted and reweighted to be representative of the population of England. We describe trends in unweighted prevalence with daily growth rates, doubling times, reproduction numbers (R) and splines. We estimated odds ratios for swab-positivity using mutually-adjusted multivariable logistic regression models. <h4>Results</h4> We found 821 positives from 105,123 swabs giving an unweighted prevalence of 0.78% (95% CI, 0.73%, 0.84%) and a weighted prevalence of 0.96% (0.87%, 1.05%). The weighted prevalence estimate was ∼30% lower than that of 1.32% (1.20%, 1.45%) obtained in the second half of round 6. This decrease corresponds to a halving time of 37 (30, 47) days and an R number of 0.88 (0.86, 0.91). Using only data from the most recent period, we estimate an R number of 0.71 (0.54, 0.90). A spline fit to prevalence showed a rise shortly after the previous period of data collection followed by a fall coinciding with the start of lockdown. The national trends were driven mainly by reductions in higher-prevalence northern regions, with prevalence approximately unchanged in the Midlands and London, and smaller reductions in southern lower-prevalence regions. Sub-regional analyses showed variable changes in prevalence at the local level including marked declines in the North, but also local areas of growth in East and West Midlands. Mutually adjusted models in the most recent period indicated: people of Asian ethnicity, those living in the most deprived neighbourhoods, and those living in the largest households, had higher odds of swab-positivity. <h4>Conclusion</h4> Three weeks into the second national lockdown in England there has been a ∼30% proportionate reduction in prevalence overall, with greater reductions in the North. As a result, inter-regional heterogeneity has reduced, although average absolute prevalence remains high at ∼1%. Continued monitoring of the epidemic in the community remains essential until prevalence is reliably suppressed to much lower levels, for example, through widespread vaccination.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/12/02/2020.11.30.20239806.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.30.20239806; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR247290; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR247290&type=FILE&fileName=EMS107598-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We hypothesised that outcomes would be poorer for those of South Asian ethnicity hospitalised from a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, once confounding factors, health seeking behaviours and community demographics were considered and that this might reflect a more aggressive disease course in these patients. <h4>Methods</h4> Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring admission to University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust(UHB) in Birmingham UK between 10 th March 2020-17 th April 2020 were included. Standardised Admission Ratio(SAR) and Standardised Mortality Ratio(SMR) were calculated using observed COVID-19 admissions/deaths and 2011 census data. Hazard Ratio (aHR) for mortality was estimated using Cox proportional hazard model adjusting and propensity score matching. <h4>Results</h4> All patients admitted to UHB with COVID-19 during the study period were included (2217 in total). Fifty-eight percent were male, 69.5% White and the majority (80.2%) had co-morbidities. Eighteen and a half percent were of South Asian ethnicity, and these patients were more likely to be younger, have no co-morbidities but twice the prevalence of diabetes than White patients. SAR and SMR suggested more admissions and deaths in South Asian patients than would be predicted and they were more likely to present with severe disease despite no delay in presentation since symptom onset. South Asian ethnicity was associated with an increased risk of death; both by Cox regression (Hazard Ratio 1.4 (95%CI 1.2–1.8) after adjusting for age, sex, deprivation and comorbidities and by propensity score matching, matching for the same factors but categorising ethnicity into South Asian or not (Hazard ratio 1.3 (1.0-1.6)). <h4>Conclusions</h4> Those of South Asian ethnicity appear at risk of worse COVID-19 outcomes, further studies need to establish the underlying mechanistic pathways.","The objective of this study was to determine if specific ethnic groups are at higher risk of dying from covid-19 infection.

Optimising vaccination strategies is essential to reduce the disease burden in this vulnerable population. <h4>Methods</h4> With the approval of NHS England, we performed a retrospective cohort study to estimate the comparative effectiveness of schedules involving AZD1222 (AZ; ChAdOx1-S) and BNT162b2 (BNT) among people with kidney disease. Using linked primary care and UK Renal Registry records in the OpenSAFELY-TPP platform, we identified adults with stage 3– 5 chronic kidney disease, dialysis recipients, and kidney transplant recipients. We used Cox proportional hazards models to compare COVID-19-related outcomes and non-COVID-19 death after two-dose (AZ–AZ vs BNT–BNT) and three-dose (AZ–AZ–BNT vs BNT–BNT– BNT) schedules. <h4>Findings</h4> After two doses, incidence during the Delta wave was higher in AZ–AZ (n=257,580) than BNT–BNT recipients (n=169,205; adjusted hazard ratios [95% CIs] 1·43 [1·37–1·50], 1·59 [1·43–1·77], 1·44 [1·12–1·85], and 1·09 [1·02–1·17] for SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-related hospitalisation, COVID-19-related death, and non-COVID-19 death, respectively). Findings were consistent across disease subgroups, including dialysis and transplant recipients. After three doses, there was little evidence of differences between AZ– AZ–BNT (n=220,330) and BNT–BNT–BNT recipients (n=157,065) for any outcome during a period of Omicron dominance. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Among individuals with moderate-to-severe kidney disease, two doses of BNT conferred stronger protection than AZ against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease. A subsequent BNT dose levelled the playing field, emphasising the value of heterologous RNA doses in vulnerable populations. <h4>Funding</h4> National Core Studies, Wellcome Trust, MRC, and Health Data Research UK. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We searched Medline for studies published between 1 st December 2020 and 7 th September 2022 using the following term: “(coronavir* or covid* or sars*) and (vaccin* or immunis* or immuniz*) and (kidney or dialysis or h?emodialysis or transplant or renal) and (efficacy or effectiveness)” . We identified studies reporting on the effectiveness of various COVID-19 vaccines in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease. Several studies have reported no clear differences in effectiveness against outcomes of varying severity after two doses of BNT162b2 or AZD1222 compared to unvaccinated controls, which is contrary to the significantly higher antibody levels observed after BNT162b2 in immunogenicity studies. One study also showed that a third dose of RNA vaccine restored some protection against the Omicron variant among BNT162b2- and AZD1222-primed individuals, with no clear differences between these groups. This finding is consistent with immunogenicity data suggesting that a third dose of BNT162b2 may reduce the gap in antibody levels observed after two of AZD1222 versus BNT162b2. Notably, we found few studies directly comparing effectiveness in BNT162b2 versus AZD1222 recipients, which reduces biases associated with comparison to a small and potentially unrepresentative group of unvaccinated controls. We also found no studies exploring COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in kidney disease groups of varying severity (CKD, dialysis, and kidney transplant). <h4>Added value of this study</h4> This is the largest study to compare the effectiveness of two- and three-dose regimens involving AZD1222 and BNT162b2 among people with moderate-to-severe kidney disease. We compared effectiveness after two and three doses in 426,780 and 377,395 individuals, respectively, and harnessed unique data linkages between primary care records and UK Renal Registry data to identify people with CKD and end-stage renal disease (including dialysis and kidney transplant recipients) with high accuracy. During the Delta wave of infection, we observed a higher risk of COVID-19-related outcomes of varying severity after two doses of AZD1222 versus BNT162b2, with consistent findings in CKD, dialysis, and transplant subgroups. After a third dose of BNT162b2, AZD1222- and BNT162b2-primed individuals had similar rates of COVID-19-related outcomes during a period of Omicron dominance. Implications of all the available evidence A growing body of immunogenicity and effectiveness data – including the present study – suggest that two doses of BNT162b2 confers stronger protection than AZD1222 among people with moderate-to-severe kidney disease. However, a third dose of BNT162b2 appears to compensate for this immunity deficit, providing equivalent protection in BNT162b2- and AZD1222-primed individuals. Achieving high coverage with additional RNA vaccine doses (whether homologous or heterologous) has the capacity to reduce the burden of disease in this vulnerable population.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/11/18/2022.11.16.22282396.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.11.16.22282396; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR573047; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR573047&type=FILE&fileName=EMS157362-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We now use national, pre- and post-pandemic electronic health records (EHR) to develop and validate a model incorporating these factors for prediction of excess deaths.<br><br>Methods: In development (Clinical Practice Research Datalink) and validation (NHS Digital Trusted Research Environment) cohorts in primary and secondary care EHR in England, we included 3·8 million and 35·1 million individuals aged ≥30 years, respectively. For model development, we predicted excess deaths using baseline one-year all-cause mortality risk and assumed RR=3 and IR=10%. For model validation, we observed number of excess deaths from March 2020 to March 2021. We used baseline mortality risk, IR and RR (assumed and observed) to predict excess deaths related to COVID-19.   <br><br>Findings: Among individuals with at least one high-risk condition, baseline (pre-pandemic) 1-year mortality risk at one year was 4·46% (95% CI 4·41–4·51) and 3.55% (3.54-3.57) in development and validation cohorts, respectively. In our original published model, we predicted 73,498 COVID-19 deaths over 1 year for the population of England. From 1st March 2020 to 1st March 2021, there were 127,020 observed excess deaths. Observed RR was 4·34 (4·31-4·38, 95% CI) and IR was 6·27% (6·26-6·28, 95%CI). In the validation cohort, predicted excess deaths over one year were 100,338 compared with the observed 127,020 deaths with a ratio of predicted to observed excess deaths of 0.79.

Our analyses show that EHR could inform pandemic planning and surveillance, despite limited use in emergency preparedness to-date.

Here using qualitative behavioural analyses we report how the SRF worked. <h4>Methods</h4> Prior to a multisite non-randomised trial of its effectiveness, the SRF was coded in relation to its putative behaviour change content (using the theoretical domains framework (TDF), the behaviour change wheel (BCW) and the behaviour change technique taxonomy (BCTTv1)). After the SRF had been used, through the peak of the Alpha variant, we conducted in-depth interviews from diverse professional staff (N=39) from a heterogeneous purposive sub-sample of hospital trial sites (n=5/14). Deductive thematic analysis explored participants’ accounts of using the SRF according to its putative content in addition to inductive exploration of their experiences. <h4>Results</h4> We found empirical support for the putative theoretical mechanisms of ‘Knowledge’ and ‘Behavioural regulation’, as well as for intervention functions of ‘Education’ and ‘Persuasion’ and ‘Enablement’, and for particular BCTs ‘1.2 Problem solving’, ‘2.6 Biofeedback’, ‘2.7 Feedback on outcomes of behaviour’, and ‘7.1 Prompts and cues’. Most participants found the SRF useful and believed it could shape IPC behaviour. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Our process evaluation of the SRF provided granular and general support for the SRF working to change IPC behaviours. Our analysis highlighted useful SRF content. However, we also note that, without complementary work on systematically embedding the SRF within routine practice and wider hospital systems, it may not reach its full potential to reduce nosocomial infection. <h4>What is already known on this subject?</h4> Health psychology remains under-exploited within infection prevention and control (IPC) interventions For genomic insights to be understood by a range of health care professionals and elicit changes in IPC behaviour, ways of translating complex genomic insights into a simple format are needed. These simple translation tools can be described as whole genome sequence report forms (SRFs) Nothing is currently known about the use of SRFs, for SARS-CoV-2 or other infections, to change hospital-based IPC behaviour. Health psychological tools such as the behaviour change wheel (BCW), the theoretical domains framework (TDF), and the behaviour change technique taxonomy (BCTTv1) are widely used to develop behaviour change interventions but are rarely used to evaluate them Contemporary guidance on conducting process evaluations highlights the value of explicitly theorising how an intervention is intended to work before systematically examining how it actually worked in practice <h4>What does this study add?</h4> The paper presents a novel worked example of using tools from health psychology within a qualitative process evaluation of using an SRF during the COVID-19 pandemic in UK hospitals This paper is the first to report how people experienced using whole genome sequence report forms (SRFs) in order to change hospital-based IPC behaviour We provide qualitative evidence detailing empirical support for much of the SRF’s putative content, including casual mechanisms ‘Knowledge’ and ‘Behavioural regulation’, intervention functions such as ‘Education’ and ‘Enablement’, and for particular BCTs: ‘1.2 Problem solving’, ‘2.6 Biofeedback’, ‘2.7 Feedback on outcomes of behaviour’, and ‘7.1 Prompts and cues’",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/09/01/2022.08.30.22279427.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.30.22279427; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR538705; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR538705&type=FILE&fileName=EMS153681-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We aimed to define plasma proteomic associates of infection mortality and then apply Mendelian randomisation (MR) to yield biomarkers that may be causally associated. <h4>Methods</h4> We used UK Biobank plasma proteomic data to associate 2,923 plasma proteins with infection mortality before 31 st December 2019 (240 events in 52,520 participants). Since many plasma proteins also predict non-infection mortality, we focussed on those associated with >1.5-fold risk of infection mortality in an analysis excluding survivors. Protein quantitative trait scores (pQTS) were then used to identify whether genetically predicted protein levels also associated with infection mortality. To conduct Two Sample MR, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of infection mortality using UK Biobank participants without plasma proteomic data (n=363,953 including 984 infection deaths). <h4>Findings</h4> After adjusting for clinical risk factors, 1,142 plasma proteins were associated with risk of infection mortality (false discovery rate <0.05). 259 proteins were associated with >1.5-fold increased risk of infection versus non-infection mortality. Of these, we identified genetically predicted increasing MERTK concentration was associated with increased risk of infection mortality. GWAS for infection mortality revealed no SNPs achieving genome-wide statistical significance (p<5×10 -8 ). However, MR supported a causal association between increasing plasma MERTK protein and infection mortality (odds ratio 1.46 per unit; 95% CI 1.15-1.85; p=0.002). <h4>Interpretation</h4> Plasma proteomics demonstrates many proteins are associated with infection mortality.

We then sent respondents a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) kit for SARS-CoV-2 antibody self-testing and asked them to perform the test at home and complete a questionnaire, including reporting of their test result. Overall, 161,537 adults completed questionnaires and self-administered LFIA tests for IgG against SARS-CoV-2 between 27 October and 10 November 2020. <h4>Results</h4> The overall adjusted and weighted prevalence was 5.6% (95% CI 5.4-5.7). This was an increase from 4.4% (4.3-4.5) in round 3 (September), a relative increase of 26.9% (24.0-29.9).The largest increase by age was in the 18 to 24 year old age group, which increased (adjusted and weighted) from 6.7% (6.3-7.2) to 9.9% (9.3-10.4), and in students, (adjusted, unweighted) from 5.9% (4.8-7.1) to 12.1% (10.8-13.5).

Using these data, and a network model of people and places represented as a stochastic graph rewriting system, we estimated the relative contribution of transmission in households, schools and religious institutions to the epidemic, and the relative risk of infection in each of these settings. All congregate settings were important for transmission, with some such as primary schools and places of worship having a higher share of transmission than others. We found that the model needed a higher general-community transmission rate for women (3.3-fold), and lower susceptibility to infection in children to recreate the observed serological data.

Since then, the population eligible for vaccination against COVID-19 has been extended to include all 12-15-year-olds, and a booster programme has been initiated among adults aged 50 years and over, health care and care home workers, and immunocompromised people. Meanwhile, schoolchildren have returned to school often with few COVID-19-related precautions in place. <h4>Methods</h4> In the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study, throat and nose swabs were sent to non-overlapping random samples of the population aged 5 years and over in England. We analysed prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swab-positivity data from REACT-1 round 14 (between 9 and 27 September 2021). We combined results for round 14 with round 13 (between 24 June and 12 July 2021) and estimated vaccine effectiveness and prevalence of swab-positivity among double-vaccinated individuals. Unlike all previous rounds, in round 14, we switched from dry swabs transported by courier on a cold chain to wet swabs using saline. Also, at random, 50% of swabs (not chilled until they reached the depot) were transported by courier and 50% were sent through the priority COVID-19 postal service. <h4>Results</h4> We observed stable or rising prevalence (with an R of 1.03 (0.94, 1.14) overall) during round 14 with a weighted prevalence of 0.83% (0.76%, 0.89%). The highest weighted prevalence was found in children aged 5 to 12 years at 2.32% (1.96%, 2.73%) and 13 to 17 years at 2.55% (2.11%, 3.08%). All positive virus samples analysed correspond to the Delta variant or sub-lineages of Delta with one instance of the E484K escape mutation detected. The epidemic was growing in those aged 17 years and under with an R of 1.18 (1.03, 1.34), but decreasing in those aged 18 to 54 years with an R of 0.81 (0.68, 0.97). For all participants and all vaccines combined, at ages 18 to 64 years, vaccine effectiveness against infection (rounds 13 and 14 combined) was estimated to be 62.8% (49.3%, 72.7%) after two doses compared to unvaccinated people when adjusted for round, age, sex, index of multiple deprivation, region and ethnicity; the adjusted estimate was 44.8% (22.5%, 60.7%) for AstraZeneca and 71.3% (56.6%, 81.0%) for Pfizer-BioNTech, and for all vaccines combined it was 66.4% (49.6%, 77.6%) against symptomatic infection (one or more of 26 surveyed symptoms in month prior). Across rounds 13 and 14, at ages 18 years and over, weighted prevalence of swab-positivity was 0.55% (0.50%, 0.61%) for those who received their second dose 3-6 months before their swab compared to 0.35% (0.31%, 0.40%) for those whose second dose was within 3 months of their swab, while weighted prevalence among unvaccinated individuals was1.76% (1.60%, 1.95%). In round 14, age group, region, key worker status, and household size jointly contributed to the risk of higher prevalence of swab-positivity. <h4>Discussion</h4> In September 2021 infections were increasing exponentially in the 5-to-17-year age group coinciding with the start of the autumn school term in England. Relatively few schoolchildren aged 5 to 17 years have been vaccinated in the UK though single doses are now being offered to those aged 12 years and over. In adults, the higher prevalence of swab-positivity following two doses of vaccine from 3 to 6 months compared to within 3 months of second dose supports the use of a booster vaccine. It is important that the vaccination programme maintains high coverage and reaches children and unvaccinated or partially vaccinated adults to reduce transmission and associated disruptions to work and education.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/10/22/2021.10.14.21264965.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.14.21264965; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR411044; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR411044&type=FILE&fileName=EMS137524-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

To identify novel cellular phenotypes associated with disease progression, we here describe a comprehensive, unbiased analysis of the total and plasma membrane proteomes of PBMCs from a cohort of 40 unvaccinated individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection, spanning the whole spectrum of disease severity. Combined with RNA-seq and flow cytometry data from the same donors, we define a comprehensive multi-omic profile for each severity level, revealing cumulative immune cell dysregulation in progressive disease. In particular, the cell surface proteins CEACAMs1, 6 and 8, CD177, CD63 and CD89 are strongly associated with severe COVID-19, corresponding to the emergence of atypical CD3 + CD4 + CD177 + and CD16 + CEACAM1/6/8 + mononuclear cells.

The cohort represents a multi-ethnic population with 51.7% belonging to the non-White background. <h4>Main outcome measure</h4> COVID-19 incidence and mortality. <h4>Results</h4> Some 226 (1.5%) participants had confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis between 12 February and 12 June 2020, with an increased odds for men (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.2 to 2.04) and Black ethnicity (2.04; 1.39 to 2.95) as well as patients with moderate to severe liver disease (2.2; 1.35 to 3.59). Each additional comorbidity increased the odds of infection by 62%. Substance mis-users were at more risk of infection, so were patients on Vitamin D treatment. The higher odds ratios in patients with chronic pancreatic or mild liver conditions, age>70, and history of smoking or obesity were due to co-existing comorbidities. Increased odds of death were observed for men (3.54; 1.68 to 7.85) and Black ethnicity (3.77; 1.38 to 10.7). Patients having respiratory complications from COVID-19 without a history of chronic respiratory disease also had higher odds of death (5.77; 1.75 to 19). <h4>Conclusions</h4> In this large population-based study of HPB patients, men, Black ethnicity, pre-existing moderate to severe liver conditions, six common medical multi-morbidities, substance mis-use, and a history of Vitamin D treatment independently posed higher odds of acquiring COVID-19 compared to their respective counterparts. The odds of death were significantly high for men and Black people. <h4>STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY</h4> First multi-ethnic population-based study on COVID-19 in patients with hepato-pancreato-biliary group of diseases.

PRINCIPLE is the UK national platform investigating repurposed therapies for COVID-19 treatment of older people in the community at high risk of complications. Standard methods of patient recruitment were failing to meet the required pace and scale of enrolment. This paper describes the development and appraisal of a near real-time, data-driven, ethical approach for enhancing recruitment in community care by contacting people with a recent COVID-19 positive test result from the central NHS Test and Trace service within 24-48 hours of their test result. <h4>Methods</h4> A multi-disciplinary team was formed to solve the technical, ethical, public perception, logistical and information governance issues required to provide a near-real time (within 24-48 hours of receiving a positive test) feed of potential trial participants from test result data to the research team. PRINCIPLE was also given unique access to the Summary Care Record (SCR) to ensure safe prescribing, and to enable the trial team to quickly and safely bring consented patients into the trial. A survey of the public was used to understand public perceptions of the use of test data for this proposed methodology. <h4>Results</h4> Prior to establishing the data service, PRINCIPLE registered on average 87 participants per week. This increased by up to 87 additional people registered per week from the test data, contributing to an increase from 1,013 recruits to PRINCIPLE at the start of October 2020 to 2,802 recruits by 20 th December 2020. While procedural caveats were identified by the public consultation, out of 2,639 people contacted by PRINCIPLE following a positive test result, no one raised a concern about being approached. <h4>Conclusions</h4> This paper describes a novel approach to using near-real time NHS operational data to recruit community-based patients within a few days of presentation with acute illness. This approach increased recruitment, and reduced time between positive test and randomisation, allowing more rapid evaluation of treatments and increased safety for participants. End-to-end public and patient involvement in the design of the approach provided evidence to inform information governance decisions. <h4>Trial registration</h4> PRINCIPLE is funded by UK Research and Innovation and the Department of Health and Social Care through the National Institute for Health Research.

As patients may leave the hospital prior to detection of infection or have rapid symptom onset, we combined measures of the length of stay and the incubation period distribution to estimate how many hospital-acquired infections may have been missed.

The UK strictly-Orthodox Jewish community has been severely affected by the pandemic. This group shares characteristics with other ethnic minorities including larger family sizes, higher rates of household crowding and relative socioeconomic deprivation. We studied a UK strictly-Orthodox Jewish population to understand how COVID-19 had spread within this community. <h4>Methods</h4> We performed a household-focused cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey specific to three antigen targets. Randomly-selected households completed a standardised questionnaire and underwent serological testing with a multiplex assay for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. We report clinical illness and testing before the serosurvey, seroprevalence stratified by age and gender. We used random-effects models to identify factors associated with infection and antibody titres. <h4>Findings</h4> A total of 343 households, consisting of 1,759 individuals, were recruited. Serum was available for 1,242 participants. The overall seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 was 64.3% (95% CI 61.6-67.0%). The lowest seroprevalence was 27.6% in children under 5 years and rose to 73.8% in secondary school children and 74% in adults. Antibody titres were higher in symptomatic individuals and declined over time since reported COVID-19 symptoms, with the decline more marked for nucleocapsid titres. <h4>Interpretation</h4> In this tight-knit religious minority population in the UK, we report one of the highest SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence levels in the world to date. In the context of this high force of infection, all age groups experienced a high burden of infection. Actions to reduce the burden of disease in this and other minority populations are urgently required. <h4>Funding</h4> This work was jointly funded by UKRI and NIHR [COV0335; MR/V027956/1], a donation from the LSHTM Alumni COVID-19 response fund, HDR UK, the MRC and the Wellcome Trust. The funders had no role in the design, conduct or analysis of the study or the decision to publish. The authors have no financial relationships with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work in the previous three years; no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work. <h4>Research In Context</h4> <h4>Evidence before the study</h4> In January 2020, we searched PubMed for articles on rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst ethnic minority groups and amongst the Jewish population. Search teams included “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, seroprevalence, “ethnic minority”, and “Jewish” with no language restrictions. We also searched UK government documents on SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst minority groups. By January 2020, a large number of authors had reported that ethnic minority groups experienced higher numbers of cases and increased hospitalisations due to COVID-19. A small number of articles provided evidence that strictly-Orthodox Jewish populations had experienced a high rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection but extremely limited data was available on overall population level rates of infection amongst specific ethnic minority population groups. There was also extremely limited data on rates of infection amongst young children from ethnic minority groups. <h4>Added value of the study</h4> We report findings from a population representative, household survey of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst a UK strictly Orthodox Jewish population. We demonstrate an extremely high seroprevalence rate of SARS-CoV-2 in this population which is more than five times the estimated seroprevalence nationally and five times the estimated seroprevalence in London. In addition the large number of children in our survey, reflective of the underlying population structure, allows us to demonstrate that in this setting there is a significant burden of disease in all age groups with secondary school aged children having an equivalent seroprevalence to adults. <h4>Implications of the available evidence</h4> Our data provide clear evidence of the markedly disproportionate impact of SARS-CoV-2 in minority populations. In this setting infection occurs at high rates across all age groups including pre-school, primary school and secondary school-age children. Contextually appropriate measures to specifically reduce the impact of SARS-CoV-2 amongst minority populations are urgently required.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/02/03/2021.02.01.21250839.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.01.21250839; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR277515; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR277515&type=FILE&fileName=EMS115861-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

However, small changes in the frequency of one lineage over another are often difficult to interpret because surveillance samples are obtained from a variety of sources. Here, we describe lineage dynamics and phylogenetic relationships using sequences obtained from a random community sample who provided a throat and nose swab for rt-PCR during the first three months of 2021 as part of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study. Overall, diversity decreased during the first quarter of 2021, with the B.1.1.7 lineage (first identified in Kent) predominant, driven by a 0.3 unit higher reproduction number over the prior wild type. During January, positive samples were more likely B.1.1.7 in younger and middle-aged adults (aged 18 to 54) than in other age groups. Although individuals infected with the B.1.1.7 lineage were no more likely to report one or more classic COVID-19 symptoms compared to those infected with wild type, they were more likely to be antibody positive 6 weeks after infection. Viral load was higher in B.1.1.7 infection as measured by cycle threshold (Ct) values, but did not account for the increased rate of testing positive for antibodies. The presence of infections with non-imported B.1.351 lineage (first identified in South Africa) during January, but not during February or March, suggests initial establishment in the community followed by fade-out. However, this occurred during a period of stringent social distancing and targeted public health interventions and does not immediately imply similar lineages could not become established in the future.

Underlying medical conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease are based on adult data, but have been applied across all ages resulting in large numbers of families undertaking social ‘shielding’ (vulnerable group). We conducted a retrospective analysis of children with suspected COVID-19 at a Specialist Children’s Hospital to determine outcomes based on COVID-19 testing status and underlying health vulnerabilities. <h4>Methods</h4> Routine clinical data were extracted retrospectively from the Institution’s Electronic Health Record system and Digital Research Environment for patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses. Data were compared between Sars-CoV-2 positive and negative patients (CoVPos / CoVNeg respectively), and in relation to presence of underlying health vulnerabilities based on Public Health England guidance. <h4>Findings</h4> Between 1 st March and 15 th May 2020, 166 children (<18 years of age) presented to a specialist children’s hospital with clinical features of possible COVID-19 infection. 65 patients (39.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus. CoVPos patients were older (median 9 [0.9 - 14] years vs median 1 [0.1 - 5.7.5] years respectively, p <0.001). There was a significantly reduced proportion of vulnerable cases (47.7% vs 72.3%, p =0.002), but no difference in proportion of vulnerable patients requiring ventilation (61% vs 64.3%, p = 0.84) between CoVPos and CoVNeg groups.

There is uncertainty about its predisposing factors and the extent of the resultant public health burden, with estimates of prevalence and duration varying widely. <h4>Methods</h4> Within rounds 3–5 of the REACT-2 study, 508,707 people in the community in England were asked about a prior history of COVID-19 and the presence and duration of 29 different symptoms. We used uni-and multivariable models to identify predictors of persistence of symptoms (12 weeks or more). We estimated the prevalence of symptom persistence at 12 weeks, and used unsupervised learning to cluster individuals by symptoms experienced. <h4>Findings</h4> Among the 508,707 participants, the weighted prevalence of self-reported COVID-19 was 19.2% (95% CI: 19.1,19.3). 37.7% of 76,155 symptomatic people post COVID-19 experienced at least one symptom, while 14.8% experienced three or more symptoms, lasting 12 weeks or more. This gives a weighted population prevalence of persistent symptoms of 5.75% (5.68, 5.81) for one and 2.22% (2.1, 2.26) for three or more symptoms. Almost a third of people (8,771/28,713 [30.5%]) with at least one symptom lasting 12 weeks or more reported having had severe COVID-19 symptoms (“significant effect on my daily life”) at the time of their illness, giving a weighted prevalence overall for this group of 1.72% (1.69,1.76). The prevalence of persistent symptoms was higher in women than men (OR: 1.51 [1.46,1.55]) and, conditional on reporting symptoms, risk of persistent symptoms increased linearly with age by 3.5 percentage points per decade of life. Obesity, smoking or vaping, hospitalisation, and deprivation were also associated with a higher probability of persistent symptoms, while Asian ethnicity was associated with a lower probability. Two stable clusters were identified based on symptoms that persisted for 12 weeks or more: in the largest cluster, tiredness predominated, while in the second there was a high prevalence of respiratory and related symptoms. <h4>Interpretation</h4> A substantial proportion of people with symptomatic COVID-19 go on to have persistent symptoms for 12 weeks or more, which is age-dependent. Clinicians need to be aware of the differing manifestations of Long COVID which may require tailored therapeutic approaches. Managing the long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population will remain a major challenge for health services in the next stage of the pandemic. <h4>Funding</h4> The study was funded by the Department of Health and Social Care in England. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> Recent systematic reviews have documented the wide range of symptoms and reported prevalence of persistent symptoms following COVID-19. A dynamic review of Long COVID studies (NIHR Evidence) in March 2021 summarised the literature on the prevalence of persistent symptoms after acute COVID19, and reported that most studies (14) were of hospitalised patients, with higher prevalence of persistent symptoms compared with two community-based studies. There was limited evidence from community studies beyond 12 weeks. Another systematic review reported a median of over 70% of people with symptoms lasting at least 60 days. A review of risk factors for Long COVID found consistent evidence for an increased risk amongst women and those with high body mass index (BMI) but inconsistent findings on the role of age and little evidence concerning risks among different socioeconomic or ethnic groups which are often not well captured in routine healthcare records. Long COVID is increasingly recognised as heterogenous, likely underpinned by differing biological mechanisms, but there is not yet consensus on defining subtypes of the condition. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> This community-based study of over half a million people was designed to be representative of the adult population of England. A random sample of adults ages 18 years and above registered with a GP were invited irrespective of previous access to services for COVID-19, providing an estimate of population prevalence that was representative of the whole population. The findings show substantial declines in symptom prevalence over the first 12 weeks following Covid-19, reported by nearly one fifth of respondents, of whom over a third remained symptomatic at 12 weeks and beyond, with little evidence for decline thereafter. Risk factors identified for persistent symptoms (12 weeks or more) suggestive of Long COVID confirm some previous findings - an increased risk in women, obese and overweight individuals and those hospitalised for COVID-19, with strong evidence for an increasing risk with age. Additional evidence was found for an increased risk in those with lower income, smoking or vaping and healthcare or care home workers. A lower risk was found in those of Asian ethnicity. Clustering identified two distinct groups of individuals wit h different symptom profiles at 12 weeks, highlighting the heterogeneity of clinical presentation. The smaller cluster had higher prevalence of respiratory and related symptoms, while for those in the larger cluster tiredness was the dominant symptom, with lower prevalence of organ-specific symptoms. <h4>Implications of available evidence</h4> There is a high prevalence of persistent symptoms beyond 12 weeks after acute COVID-19, with little evidence of decline thereafter. This highlights the needs for greater support for patients, both through specialised services and, for those from low-income settings, financial support. The understanding that there are distinct clusters of persistent symptoms, the most common of which is dominated by fatigue, is important for the recognition and clinical management of the condition outside of specialised services.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/07/03/2021.06.28.21259452.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.28.21259452; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR365249; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR365249&type=FILE&fileName=EMS129876-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Laboratory analyses were performed across Imperial College London sites and university facilities. <h4>Participants</h4> Two cohorts of patients were recruited; the first was a cohort of 108 renal transplant patients attending clinic following SARS-CoV-2 vaccine booster, the second cohort comprised 40 healthcare workers attending for first SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and 21 day follow up. A total of 186 paired samples were collected. <h4>Interventions</h4> During the participants visit, capillary blood samples were analysed on LFIA device, while paired venous sampling was sent for serological assessment of antibodies to the spike protein (anti-S) antibodies. Anti-S IgG were detected using the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG Quant II CMIA. <h4>Main outcome measures</h4> The accuracy of Fortress LFIA in detecting IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 compared to anti-spike protein detection on Abbott Assay. <h4>Results</h4> Using the threshold value for positivity on serological testing of ≥7.10 BAU/ml, the overall performance of the test produces an estimate of sensitivity of 91.94% (95% CI 85.67% to 96.06%) and specificity of 93.55% (95% CI 84.30% to 98.21%) using the Abbott assay as reference standard. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Fortress LFIA performs well in the detection of antibody responses for intended purpose of population level surveys, but does not meet criteria for individual testing.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/07/16/2021.07.14.21260488.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.14.21260488; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR371208; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR371208&type=FILE&fileName=EMS130798-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Multiple regions of the country are at high infection prevalence and all areas experienced rapid recent growth of the epidemic during October 2020. <h4>Methods</h4> REACT-1 is a series of community surveys of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR swab-positivity in England designed to monitor the spread of the epidemic and thus increase situational awareness. Round 6 of REACT-1 commenced swab-collection on 16th October. A prior interim report included data from 16th to 25th October for 85,971 participants. Here, we report data for the entire round on 160,175 participants with swab results obtained up to 2nd November 2020. <h4>Results</h4> Overall weighted prevalence of infection in the community in England was 1.3% or 130 people per 10,000 infected, up from 60 people per 10,000 in the round 5 report (18th September to 5th October 2020), doubling every 24 days on average since the prior round. The corresponding R number was estimated to be 1.2. Prevalence of infection was highest in North West (2.4%, up from 1.2%), followed by Yorkshire and The Humber (2.3% up from 0.84%), West Midlands (1.6% up from 0.60%), North East (1.5% up from 1.1%), East Midlands (1.3% up from 0.56%), London (0.97%, up from 0.54%), South West (0.80% up from 0.33%), South East (0.69% up from 0.29%), and East of England (0.69% up from 0.30%). Rapid growth in the South observed in the first half of round 6 was no longer apparent in the second half of round 6. We also observed a decline in prevalence in Yorkshire and The Humber during this period. Comparing the first and second halves of round 6, there was a suggestion of decline in weighted prevalence in participants aged 5 to 12 years and in those aged 25 to 44 years. While prevalence remained high, in the second half of round 6 there was suggestion of a slight fall then rise that was seen nationally and also separately in both the North and the South. <h4>Conclusion</h4> The impact of the second national lockdown in England is not yet known.

Concerns have been raised that antipsychotic prescribing may have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic due to social restrictions imposed to limit the spread of the virus. We used multisource, routinely-collected healthcare data from Wales, UK, to investigate prescribing and mortality trends in people with dementia before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. <h4>Methods</h4> We used individual-level, anonymised, population-scale linked health data to identify adults aged ≥60 years with a diagnosis of dementia in Wales, UK. We explored antipsychotic prescribing trends over 67 months between 1 st January 2016 and 1 st August 2021, overall and stratified by age and dementia subtype. We used time series analyses to examine all-cause, myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke mortality over the study period and identified the leading causes of death in people with dementia. <h4>Findings</h4> Of 57,396 people with dementia, 11,929 (21%) were prescribed an antipsychotic at any point during follow-up. Accounting for seasonality, antipsychotic prescribing increased during the second half of 2019 and throughout 2020. However, the absolute difference in prescribing rates was small, ranging from 1253 to 1305 per 10,000 person-months. Prescribing in the 60-64 age group and those with Alzheimer’s disease increased throughout the 5-year period. All-cause and stroke mortality increased in the second half of 2019 and throughout 2020 but MI mortality declined. From January 2020, COVID-19 was the second commonest underlying cause of death in people with dementia. <h4>Interpretation</h4> During the COVID-19 pandemic there was a small increase in antipsychotic prescribing in people with dementia. The long-term increase in antipsychotic prescribing in younger people and in those with Alzheimer’s disease warrants further investigation. <h4>Funding</h4> British Heart Foundation (BHF) (SP/19/3/34678) via the BHF Data Science Centre led by HDR UK, and the Scottish Neurological Research Fund. <h4>Research in Context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We searched Ovid MEDLINE for studies describing antipsychotic prescribing trends in people with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic, published between 1st January 2020 and 22nd March 2022. The following search terms were used: (exp Antipsychotic Agents/ OR antipsychotic.mp OR neuroleptic.mp OR risperidone.mp OR exp Risperidone/ OR quetiapine.mp OR exp Quetiapine Fumarate/ OR olanzapine.mp OR exp Olanzapine/ OR exp Psychotropic Drugs/ or psychotropic.mp) AND (exp Dementia/ OR exp Alzheimer Disease/ or alzheimer.mp) AND (prescri*.mp OR exp Prescriptions/ OR exp Electronic Prescribing/ OR trend*.mp OR time series.mp). The search identified 128 published studies, of which three were eligible for inclusion. Two studies, based on data from England and the USA, compared antipsychotic prescribing in people with dementia before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both reported an increase in the proportion of patients prescribed an antipsychotic after the onset of the pandemic. A third study, based in the Netherlands, reported antipsychotic prescription trends in nursing home residents with dementia during the first four months of the pandemic, comparing prescribing rates to the timings of lifting of social restrictions, showing that antipsychotic prescribing rates remained constant throughout this period. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> We conducted age-standardised time series analyses using comprehensive, linked, anonymised, individual-level routinely-collected, population-scale health data for the population of Wales, UK. By accounting for seasonal variations in prescribing and mortality, we demonstrated that the absolute increase in antipsychotic prescribing in people with dementia of any cause during the COVID-19 pandemic was small. In contrast, antipsychotic prescribing in the youngest age group (60-64 years) and in people with a subtype diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease increased throughout the five-year study period. Accounting for seasonal variation, all-cause mortality rates in people with dementia began to increase in late 2019 and increased sharply during the first few months of the pandemic. COVID-19 became the leading non-dementia cause of death in people with dementia from 2020 to 2021. Stroke mortality increased during the pandemic, following a similar pattern to that of all-cause mortality, whereas myocardial infarction rates decreased. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> During COVID-19 we observed a large increase in all-cause and stroke mortality in people with dementia. When seasonal variations are accounted for, antipsychotic prescribing rates in all-cause dementia increased by a small amount before and during the pandemic in the UK. The increased prescribing rates in younger age groups and in people with Alzheimer’s disease warrants further investigation.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/02/19/2023.02.18.23286127.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.02.18.23286127; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR618591; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR618591&type=FILE&fileName=EMS170574-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of rapid whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2, supported by a novel probabilistic reporting methodology, to inform infection prevention and control (IPC) practice within NHS hospital settings. <h4>Methods and analysis</h4> COG-UK HOCI (COG-UK Consortium Hospital-Onset COVID-19 Infections study) is a multicentre, prospective, interventional, superiority study. Eligible patients must be admitted to hospital with first confirmed SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive test result >48h from time of admission, where COVID-19 diagnosis was not suspected upon admission. The projected sample size for 14 participating sites covering all study phases over winter-spring 2020/2021 in the United Kingdom is 2,380 patients. The intervention is the return of a sequence report, within 48 hours in one phase (rapid local lab) and within 5-10 days in a second phase (mimicking central lab use), comparing the viral genome from an eligible study participant with others within and outside the hospital site. The primary outcomes are the incidence of Public Health England (PHE)/IPC-defined SARS-CoV-2 hospital-acquired infection during the baseline and two interventional phases, and proportion of hospital-onset cases with genomic evidence of transmission linkage following implementation of the intervention where such linkage was not suspected by initial IPC investigation. Secondary outcomes include incidence of hospital outbreaks, with and without sequencing data; actual and desirable changes to IPC actions; periods of healthcare worker (HCW) absence. A process evaluation using qualitative interviews with HCWs will be conducted alongside the study and analysis, underpinned by iterative programme theory of the sequence report. Health economic analysis will be conducted to determine cost-benefit of the intervention, and whether this leads to economic advantages within the NHS setting. <h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4> The protocol has been approved by the National Research Ethics Service Committee (Cambridge South 20/EE/0118). This manuscript is based on version 5.0 of the protocol. The study findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications. <h4>Study Registration number</h4> ISRCTN50212645 <h4>Strengths and limitations of this study</h4> The COG-UK HOCI study harnesses the infrastructure of the UK’s existing national COVID-19 genome sequencing platform to evaluate the specific benefit of sequencing to hospital infection control. The evaluation is thought to be the first interventional study globally to assess effectiveness of genomic sequencing for infection control in an unbiased patient selection in secondary care settings. A range of institutional settings will participate, from specialist NHS-embedded or academic centres experienced in using pathogen genomics to district general hospitals. The findings are likely to have wider applicability in future decisions to utilise genome sequencing for infection control of other pathogens (such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, norovirus, clostridium difficile and antimicrobial resistant pathogens) in secondary care settings. The study has been awarded UK NIHR Urgent Public Health status, ensuring prioritised access to NIHR Clinical Research Network (CRN) research staff to recruit patients. The study does not have a randomised controlled design due to the logistics of managing this against diverse standard practice.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/04/15/2021.04.13.21255342.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.13.21255342; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR312488; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR312488&type=FILE&fileName=EMS122858-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.13.21255342

We compared the differences in the risk of COVID-19 related death between ethnic groups in the first and second waves the of COVID-19 pandemic in England. We also investigated whether the factors explaining differences in COVID-19 death between ethnic groups changed between the two waves. <h4>Methods</h4> Using data from the Office for National Statistics Public Health Data Asset on individuals aged 30-100 years living in private households, we conducted an observational cohort study to examine differences in the risk of death involving COVID-19 between ethnic groups in the first wave (from 24 th January 2020 until 31 st August 2020) and second wave (from 1 st September to 28 th December 2020). We estimated age-standardised mortality rates (ASMR) in the two waves stratified by ethnic groups and sex. We also estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for ethnic-minority groups compared with the White British population, adjusted for geographical factors, socio-demographic characteristics, and pre-pandemic health conditions. <h4>Results</h4> The study population included over 28.9 million individuals aged 30-100 years living in private households. In the first wave, all ethnic minority groups had a higher risk of COVID-19 related death compared to the White British population. In the second wave, the risk of COVID-19 death remained elevated for people from Pakistani (ASMR: 339.9 [95% CI: 303.7 – 376.2] and 166.8 [141.7 – 191.9] deaths per 100,000 population in men and women) and Bangladeshi (318.7 [247.4 – 390.1] and 127.1 [91.1 – 171.3] in men and women)background but not for people from Black ethnic groups. Adjustment for geographical factors explained a large proportion of the differences in COVID-19 mortality in the first wave but not in the second wave. Despite an attenuation of the elevated risk of COVID-19 mortality after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and health status, the risk was substantially higher in people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani background in both the first and the second waves. <h4>Conclusion</h4> Between the first and second waves of the pandemic, the reduction in the difference in COVID-19 mortality between people from Black ethnic background and people from the White British group shows that ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality can be addressed. The continued higher rate of mortality in people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani background is alarming and requires focused public health campaign and policy changes. *VN and NI contributed equally to this paper <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> A recent systematic review by Pan and colleagues demonstrated that people of ethnic minority background in the UK and the USA have been disproportionately affected by the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, compared to White populations. While several studies have investigated whether adjusting for socio-demographic and economic factors and medical history reduces the estimated difference in risk of mortality and hospitalisation, the reasons for the differences in the risk of experiencing harms from COVID-19 are still being explored during the course of the pandemic. Studies so far have analysed the ethnic differences in COVID-19 mortality in the first wave of the pandemic. The evidence on the temporal trend of ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality, especially those from the second wave of the pandemic, is scarce. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> Using data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Public Health Data Asset on 29 million adults aged 30-100 years living in private households in England, we conducted an observational cohort study to examine the differences in the risk of death involving COVID-19 between ethnic groups in the first wave (from 24 th January 2020 until 31 st August 2020) and second wave (from 1 st September to 28 th December 2020). We find that in the first wave all ethnic minority groups were at elevated risk of COVID-19 related death compared to the White British population. In the second wave, the differences in the risk of COVID-19 related death attenuated for Black African and Black Caribbean groups, remained substantially higher in people from Bangladeshi background, and worsened in people from Pakistani background. We also find that some of the factors explaining these differences in mortality have changed in the two waves. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> The risk of COVID-19 mortality during the first wave of the pandemic was elevated in people from ethnic minority background. An appreciable reduction in the difference in COVID-19 mortality in the second wave of the pandemic between people from Black ethnic background and people from the White British group is reassuring, but the continued higher rate of mortality in people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani background is alarming and requires focused public health campaign and policy response. Focusing on treating underlying conditions, although important, may not be enough in reducing the inequalities in COVID-19 mortality. Focused public health policy as well as community mobilisation and participatory public health campaign involving community leaders may help reduce the existing and widening inequalities in COVID-19 mortality.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/02/05/2021.02.03.21251004.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.03.21251004; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR278785; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR278785&type=FILE&fileName=EMS116038-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

However, the lives of children have been substantially disrupted by the pandemic through physical distancing measures and the impact on health systems and economies. In this study, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital admissions for childhood respiratory infections, severe invasive infections, and vaccine preventable disease in England was assessed along with associated mortality outcomes.<br><br>Methods: In this population-based observational study, we examined hospital admission data from every National Health Service hospital from Mar 1 2017 to Feb 28 2021. We report monthly and annual numbers of individuals hospitalised with 19 common childhood respiratory, severe invasive, and vaccine preventable infections. We compare the frequency of admissions for these conditions before and after the onset of the pandemic in England and calculate percentage changes since Mar 1 2020 for each infection overall and by demographic characteristics including age, region, deprivation, and comorbidity, and quantify mortality outcomes.<br><br>Findings: In the 12 months from Mar 1 2020, there were significant reductions compared with the preceding 36 months in the numbers of children admitted for every infection studied except pyelonephritis. These reductions were seen in all geographic regions, Index of Multiple Deprivation categories, ethnic groups and in those with underlying comorbidities. Among the respiratory infections, the greatest percentage reductions were for influenza where the number of individuals admitted decreased by 94% (95% CI 88, 97) from 5,061 (annual mean from Mar 1 2017 - Feb 29 2020) to 290 in the 12 months after Mar 1 2020, and for bronchiolitis where the number of individuals admitted decreased by over 80% (95% CI 78, 83) from 41,777 (annual mean 2017–2020) to 7,883 in 2020-21. Among the severe invasive infections, percentage decreases ranged from 20% (95% CI 13, 26) for osteomyelitis to 54% (95% CI 51, 56) for meningitis. Among the vaccine preventable infections, the greatest reduction was for measles, where the number of individuals admitted in the 12 months after Mar 1 2020 (n=12) was 92% lower (95% CI 84, 96) than the average number admitted in the previous three years (n=143). Admissions for <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> decreased by 70% (95% CI 55, 80), and admissions for <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>, <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> and mumps more than halved. Alongside the decreases in admissions, there were also decreases in the absolute numbers of 60-day fatalities after admission for sepsis, meningitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, viral wheeze and upper respiratory tract infection (RTI). For pneumonia, although the absolute number of 60-day fatalities decreased (from a 3-year average of 159 to 115 after Mar 1 2020), the proportion of individuals admitted who died within 60 days increased (age-sex adjusted odds ratio 1.73, 95% CI 1.42, 2.11).<br><br>Interpretation: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a range of behavioural changes (adoption of non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs)) and societal strategies (school closures, lockdowns and restricted travel) were used to reduce transmission of SARS CoV2 which have also significantly reduced transmission of common and severe childhood infections.

Our aim is to compare the health benefits of sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa against the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infections through visiting routine vaccination service delivery points. <h4>Methods</h4> We used two scenarios to approximate the child deaths that may be caused by immunisation coverage reductions during COVID-19 outbreaks. First, we used previously reported country-specific child mortality impact estimates of childhood immunisation for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, pneumococcal, rotavirus, measles, meningitis A, rubella, and yellow fever (DTP3, HepB3, Hib3, PCV3, RotaC, MCV1, MCV2, MenA, RCV, YFV) to approximate the future deaths averted before completing five years of age by routine childhood vaccination during a 6-month COVID-19 risk period without catch-up campaigns. Second, we analysed an alternative scenario that approximates the health benefits of sustaining routine childhood immunisation to only the child deaths averted from measles outbreaks during the COVID-19 risk period. The excess number of infections due to additional SARS-CoV-2 exposure during immunisation visits assumes that contact reducing interventions flatten the outbreak curve during the COVID-19 risk period, that 60% of the population will have been infected by the end of that period, that children can be infected by either vaccinators or during transport and that upon child infection the whole household would be infected. Country specific household age structure estimates and age dependent infection fatality rates are then applied to calculate the number of deaths attributable to the vaccination clinic visits. We present benefit-risk ratios for routine childhood immunisation alongside 95% uncertainty range estimates from probabilistic sensitivity analysis. <h4>Findings</h4> For every one excess COVID-19 death attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infections acquired during routine vaccination clinic visits, there could be 84 (14-267) deaths in children prevented by sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa. The benefit-risk ratio for the vaccinated children, siblings, parents or adult care-givers, and older adults in the households of vaccinated children are 85,000 (4,900 - 546,000), 75,000 (4,400 - 483,000), 769 (148 - 2,700), and 96 (14 - 307) respectively. In the alternative scenario that approximates the health benefits to only the child deaths averted from measles outbreaks, the benefit-risk ratio to the households of vaccinated children is 3 (0 - 10) under these highly conservative assumptions and if the risk to only the vaccinated children is considered, the benefit-risk ratio is 3,000 (182 - 21,000). <h4>Interpretation</h4> Our analysis suggests that the health benefits of deaths prevented by sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa far outweighs the excess risk of COVID-19 deaths associated with vaccination clinic visits, especially for the vaccinated children. However, there are other factors that must be considered for strategic decision making to sustain routine childhood immunisation in African countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. These include logistical constraints of vaccine supply chain problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, reallocation of immunisation providers to other prioritised health services, healthcare staff shortages caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections among the staff, decreased demand for vaccination arising from community reluctance to visit vaccination clinics for fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infections, and infection risk to healthcare staff providing immunisation services as well as to their households and onward SARS-CoV-2 transmission into the wider community. <h4>Funding</h4> Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1157270) <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before the study</h4> National immunisation programmes globally are at risk of disruption due to the severe health system constraints caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the physical distancing measures to mitigate the outbreak. The decrease in vaccination coverage increases the proportion of susceptible children at risk of increased morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks. Outbreaks of vaccine preventable disease have been observed during previous interruptions to routine immunisation services during an ongoing infectious disease epidemic, such as during the 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, when most health resources were shifted towards the Ebola response which led to decreasing vaccination coverage and consequently outbreaks of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> We estimated the benefit-risk ratio by comparing the deaths prevented by sustaining routine childhood immunisation for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, pneumococcal, rotavirus, measles, meningitis A, rubella, and yellow fever vaccines with the excess COVID-19 deaths associated with vaccination clinic visits. The benefit of routine childhood immunization programmes in all the 54 countries of Africa is higher than the COVID-19 risk associated with these vaccination clinic visits. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Routine childhood immunisation programmes should be safeguarded for continued service delivery and prioritised for the prevention of infectious diseases, as logistically possible, as part of delivering essential health services during the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa. The current immunisation service models will require adaptation, including physical distancing measures, personal protective equipment, and good hygiene practices for infection control at the vaccination clinics, and have to be complemented by new immunisation service models for sustaining routine childhood immunisation in the African countries during the COVID-19 risk period.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/06/24/2020.05.19.20106278.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.19.20106278; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR167068; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR167068&type=FILE&fileName=EMS90726-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) has estimated swab-positivity approximately monthly since May 2020 in England from RT-PCR testing of self-administered throat and nose swabs in random non-overlapping cross-sectional community samples. Estimating infection incidence from swab-positivity requires an understanding of the persistence of RT-PCR swab positivity in the community. <h4>Methods</h4> During round 8 of REACT-1 from 6 January to 22 January 2021, of the 2,282 participants who tested RT-PCR positive, we recruited 896 (39%) from whom we collected up to two additional swabs for RT-PCR approximately 6 and 9 days after the initial swab. We estimated sensitivity and duration of positivity using an exponential model of positivity decay, for all participants and for subsets by initial N-gene cycle threshold (Ct) value, symptom status, lineage and age. Estimates of infection incidence were obtained for the entire duration of the REACT-1 study using P-splines. <h4>Results</h4> We estimated the overall sensitivity of REACT-1 to detect virus on a single swab as 0.79 (0.77, 0.81) and median duration of positivity following a positive test as 9.7 (8.9, 10.6) days. We found greater median duration of positivity where there was a low N-gene Ct value, in those exhibiting symptoms, or for infection with the Alpha variant. The estimated proportion of positive individuals detected on first swab, P 0 , was found to be higher for those with an initially low N-gene Ct value and those who were pre-symptomatic. When compared to swab-positivity, estimates of infection incidence over the duration of REACT-1 included sharper features with evident transient increases around the time of key changes in social distancing measures. <h4>Discussion</h4> Home self-swabbing for RT-PCR based on a single swab, as implemented in REACT-1, has high overall sensitivity. However, participants’ time-since-infection, symptom status and viral lineage affect the probability of detection and the duration of positivity. These results validate previous efforts to estimate incidence of SARS-CoV-2 from swab-positivity data, and provide a reliable means to obtain community infection estimates to inform policy response.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/08/13/2021.08.12.21261987.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.12.21261987; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR382446; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR382446&type=FILE&fileName=EMS132863-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Due to limited inclusion of patients on KRT in clinical trials, information is limited on the effectiveness of sotrovimab (a neutralising monoclonal antibody). We sought to address this by comparing its effectiveness against molnupiravir (an antiviral) in preventing severe COVID-19 outcomes in non-hospitalised adults with symptomatic COVID-19. <h4>Methods</h4> With the approval of NHS England we used routine clinical data from 24 million patients in England linked to the UK Renal Registry (UKRR) to identify patients on KRT, and data on antiviral treatments, COVID-19 test results, hospitalisation events and death from the OpenSAFELY-TPP data resource. Cox proportional hazards models (stratified for region) were used to estimate hazard ratios of sotrovimab vs. molnupiravir with regards to COVID-19 related hospitalisation or deaths in the subsequent 28 days (as the primary outcome). Further analyses were conducted using propensity score weighting (adjusted for region) and to investigate robustness of results with regards to different time periods, missing data, and adjustment variables. We also conducted a complementary analysis using data from patients in the Scottish Renal Registry (SRR) treated with sotrovimab or molnupiravir, following similar analytical approaches. <h4>Results</h4> Among the 2367 renal patients treated with sotrovimab (n=1852) or molnupiravir (n=515) between December 16, 2021 and August 1, 2022 in England, 38 cases (1.6%) of COVID-19 related hospitalisations/deaths were observed during the 28 days of follow-up after treatment initiation, with 21 (1.1%) in the sotrovimab group and 17 (3.3%) in the molnupiravir group. In multiple-adjusted analysis sotrovimab was associated with substantially lower risk of 28-day COVID-19 related hospitalisation/death than treatment with molnupiravir (hazard ratio, HR=0.35, 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.71; P=0.004), with results remaining robust in sensitivity analyses. In the SRR cohort, there were 19 cases (1.9%) of COVID-19 related hospitalisations/deaths during the 28 days of follow-up after treatment initiation of sotrovimab (n=723) or molnupiravir (n=270). In multiple-adjusted analysis, sotrovimab showed a trend toward lower risk of 28-day COVID-19 related hospitalisation/death than treatment with molnupiravir (HR=0.39, 95% CI: 0.13 to 1.21; P=0.106). In both datasets, sotrovimab had no evidence of association with other hospitalisation/death compared with molnupiravir (HRs ranging from 0.73-1.29; P>0.05). <h4>Conclusions</h4> In routine care of non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19 on kidney replacement therapy, those who received sotrovimab had substantially lower risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes than those receiving molnupiravir.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/12/05/2022.12.02.22283049.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.02.22283049; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR579535; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR579535&type=FILE&fileName=EMS158097-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Despite a successful vaccine rollout during the first half of 2021, cases and hospitalisations have started to increase since the end of May as the SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) variant increases in frequency. The final step of relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions in England has been delayed from 21 June to 19 July 2021. <h4>Methods</h4> The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmision-1 (REACT-1) study measures the prevalence of swab-positivity among random samples of the population of England. Round 12 of REACT-1 obtained self-administered swab collections from participants from 20 May 2021 to 7 June 2021; results are compared with those for round 11, in which swabs were collected from 15 April to 3 May 2021. <h4>Results</h4> Between rounds 11 and 12, national prevalence increased from 0.10% (0.08%, 0.13%) to 0.15% (0.12%, 0.18%). During round 12, we detected exponential growth with a doubling time of 11 (7.1, 23) days and an R number of 1.44 (1.20, 1.73). The highest prevalence was found in the North West at 0.26% (0.16%, 0.41%) compared to 0.05% (0.02%, 0.12%) in the South West. In the North West, the locations of positive samples suggested a cluster in Greater Manchester and the east Lancashire area. Prevalence in those aged 5-49 was 2.5 times higher at 0.20% (0.16%, 0.26%) compared with those aged 50 years and above at 0.08% (0.06%, 0.11%). At the beginning of February 2021, the link between infection rates and hospitalisations and deaths started to weaken, although in late April 2021, infection rates and hospital admissions started to reconverge. When split by age, the weakened link between infection rates and hospitalisations at ages 65 years and above was maintained, while the trends converged below the age of 65 years. The majority of the infections in the younger group occurred in the unvaccinated population or those without a stated vaccine history. We observed the rapid replacement of the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant of SARS-CoV-2 with the Delta variant during the period covered by rounds 11 and 12 of the study. <h4>Discussion</h4> The extent to which exponential growth continues, or slows down as a consequence of the continued rapid roll-out of the vaccination programme, including to young adults, requires close monitoring. Data on community prevalence are vital to track the course of the epidemic and inform ongoing decisions about the timing of further lifting of restrictions in England.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/06/21/2021.06.17.21259103.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.17.21259103; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR359256; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR359256&type=FILE&fileName=EMS128173-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We aimed to identify risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection after primary and booster vaccinations. <h4>Methods</h4> We undertook a prospective population-based study in UK adults (≥16 years) vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, including data from Jan 12, 2021, to Feb 21, 2022. We modelled risk of post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection separately for participants who had completed a primary course of vaccination (two-dose or, in the immunosuppressed, three-dose course of either ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 [ChAdOx1] or BNT1262b2) and for those who had additionally received a booster dose (BNT1262b2 or mRNA-1273). Cox regression models were used to explore associations between sociodemographic, behavioural, clinical, pharmacological, and nutritional factors and breakthrough infection, defined as a self-reported positive result on a lateral flow or reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2. Models were further adjusted for weekly SARS-CoV-2 incidence at the local (lower tier local authority) level. <h4>Findings</h4> 14,713 participants were included in the post-primary analysis and 10,665 in the post-booster analysis, with a median follow-up of 203 days (IQR 195–216) in the post-primary cohort and 85 days (66–103) in the post-booster cohort. 1051 (7.1%) participants in the post-primary cohort and 1009 (9.4%) participants in the post-booster cohort reported a breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection. A primary course of ChAdOx1 ( vs BNT182b2) was associated with higher risk of infection, both in the post-primary cohort (adjusted hazard ratio 1.63, 95% CI 1.41–1.88) and in the post-booster cohort after boosting with mRNA-1273 (1.29 [1.03–1.61] vs BNT162b2 primary plus BNT162b2 booster). A lower risk of breakthrough infection was associated with older age (post-primary: 0.96 [0.96–0.97] per year; post-booster: 0.97 [0.96–0.98]), whereas a higher risk of breakthrough infection was associated with lower levels of education (post-primary: 1.66 [1.35–2.06] for primary or secondary vs postgraduate; post-booster: 1.36 [1.08–1.71]) and at least three weekly visits to indoor public places (post-primary: 1.38 [1.15–1.66] vs none; post-booster: 1.33 [1.10–1.60]). <h4>Conclusions</h4> Vaccine type, socioeconomic status, age, and behaviours affect risk of breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection following a primary schedule and a booster dose. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We searched PubMed, medRxiv, and Google Scholar for papers published up to Feb 18, 2022, using the search terms (breakthrough OR post-vaccin*) AND (SARS-CoV-2 OR COVID) AND (disease OR infection) AND (determinant OR “risk factor” OR associat*), with no language restrictions. Existing studies on risk factors for breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection among vaccinated individuals have found associations with age, comorbidities, vaccine type, and previous infection; however, findings have been inconsistent across studies. Most studies have been limited to specific subgroups or have focused on severe outcomes, and very few have considered breakthrough infections after a booster dose or have adjusted for behaviours affecting exposure to other people. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> This study is among the first to provide a detailed analysis of a wide range of risk factors for breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection, both after the primary course of vaccination and after a booster dose. Our large study size and detailed data have allowed us to investigate associations with various sociodemographic, clinical, pharmacological, and nutritional factors. Monthly follow-up data have additionally given us the opportunity to consider the effects of behaviours that may have changed across the pandemic, while adjusting for local SARS-CoV-2 incidence. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Our findings add to growing evidence that risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection after primary or booster vaccinations can differ to those in unvaccinated populations, with effects attenuated for previously observed risk factors such as body-mass index and Asian ethnicity. The clear difference we observed between the efficacies of ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 as the primary course of vaccination appears to have been reduced by the use of BNT162b2 boosters, but not by mNRA-1273 boosters. As more countries introduce booster vaccinations, future population-based studies with longer follow-up will be needed to investigate our findings further.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/03/13/2022.03.11.22272276.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.11.22272276; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR468085; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR468085&type=FILE&fileName=EMS148998-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

The extent to which this reflects a difference in the inherent virulence of Omicron, or just higher levels of population immunity, is currently not clear. <h4>Methods</h4> RdRp target delay (RTD: a difference in cycle threshold value of RdRp - E > 3.5) in the Seegene Allplex™ 2019-nCoV PCR assay is a proxy marker for the Delta VOC. The absence of this proxy marker in the period of transition to Omicron was used to identify suspected Omicron VOC infections. Cox regression was performed for the outcome of hospital admission in those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on the Seegene Allplex™ assay from 1 November to 14 December 2021 in the Western Cape Province, South Africa, public sector. Vaccination status at time of diagnosis, as well as prior diagnosed infection and comorbidities, were adjusted for. <h4>Results</h4> 150 cases with RTD (proxy for Delta) and 1486 cases without RTD (proxy for Omicron) were included. Cases without RTD had a lower hazard of admission (adjusted Hazard Ratio [aHR] of 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34-0.91).

Information on sixty-six potential sociodemographic, behavioural, clinical, pharmacological and nutritional determinants of serological response to vaccination was captured using serial online questionnaires. We used logistic regression to estimate multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for associations between independent variables and risk of seronegativity following two vaccine doses. Participants who were seronegative after receiving two vaccine doses were offered an additional antibody test following subsequent administration of a ‘booster’ dose of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) from September 23 to December 12, 2021. <h4>Findings</h4> Serology results following two vaccine doses were available for 9,101 participants, of whom 5,770 (63.4%) received ChAdOx1 and 3,331 (36.6%) received BNT162b2. Anti-spike IgGAM was undetectable in 378 (4.2%) participants at a median of 8.6 weeks (IQR 6.4-10.7 weeks) after their second dose of vaccine. Seronegativity following two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was associated with administration of ChAdOx1 vs BNT162b2 (aOR 7.03, 95% CI 4.39-11.24), shorter interval between first and second vaccine doses (aOR 2.37, 1.06-5.26, for <6 weeks vs >10 weeks; aOR 1.59, 1.18-2.13, for 6-10 weeks vs >10 weeks), poorer self-assessed general health (aOR 3.33, 1.49-7.46, for poor vs excellent), immunodeficiencies (aOR 6.75, 2.63-17.35) and prescription of systemic immunosuppressants (aOR 3.76, 2.44-5.78). By contrast, pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity (aOR 0.16, 0.04-0.70, for symptomatic seropositives vs seronegatives) and supplemental vitamin D intake (aOR 0.73, 0.53-0.99) were associated with reduced risk of post-vaccination seronegativity. 247/378 (65.3%) of participants who were seronegative after two doses of ChAdOx1 vs BNT162b2 provided a third sample at a median of 7.8 weeks (IQR 5.8-10.4) after receiving a booster dose of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273: eight (3.2%) of them remained seronegative after three vaccine doses, all of whom either had a primary immunodeficiency or were taking systemic immunosuppressant drugs. <h4>Interpretation</h4> We identify multiple determinants of antibody responses to two doses of ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2, many of which are potentially modifiable. Booster doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 were highly effective in achieving seroconversion in those who failed to mount antibody responses following two doses of ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2. <h4>Study registration</h4> https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04330599 <h4>Funding</h4> Barts Charity, Fischer Family Trust, The Exilarch’s Foundation, DSM Nutritional Products, Health Data Research UK <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We searched PubMed, medRxiv, and Google Scholar for papers published from January 1, 2020, to February 1, 2022, using the search terms (antibody OR humoral OR serologic* OR immunogenic*) AND (SARS-CoV-2 vaccine OR ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 coronavirus), with no language restrictions. Population-based studies investigating multiple potential determinants of vaccine immunogenicity in people with known pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 serostatus are lacking. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> This large population-based study, conducted in a population with known pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 serostatus, examines a comprehensive range of potential sociodemographic, behavioural, clinical, pharmacological and nutritional determinants of antibody responses to administration of two major SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (i.e., ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2), many of which have not previously been investigated. It is also the first population-based study to characterise antibody responses to booster doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in adults who were seronegative after their primary course of vaccination. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Increased risk of seronegativity following two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines was associated with administration of ChAdOx1 vs BNT162b2, shorter interval between first and second vaccine doses, poorer self-assessed general health, immunocompromise and SARS-CoV-2 seronegativity pre-vaccination. Regular intake of vitamin D supplements was associated with reduced risk of post-vaccination seronegativity. Randomised controlled trials are now needed to test for causality.

It was unclear if the lockdown period was associated with differences in the case-mix of non-COVID acute medical admissions compared with the previous year. <h4>Methods</h4> Retrospective data were collected for 1 st -30 th April 2019 and 1 st –30 th April 2020 from University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, one of the largest hospitals in the UK with over 2 million patient contacts per year. The latter time period was chosen to coincide with the peak of COVID-19 cases in the West Midlands. All patients admitted under acute medicine during these time periods were included. COVID-19 was confirmed by SARS-Cov-2 swab or a probable case of COVID-19 based on World Health Organization diagnostic parameters. Non-COVID patients were those with a negative SARS-Cov-2 swab and no suspicion of COVID-19. Data was sourced from UHB’s in-house electronic health system (EHS). <h4>Results</h4> The total number of acute medical admissions fell comparing April 2019 (n = 2409) to April 2020 (n = 1682). As a proportion of total admissions, those aged under 45 years decreased, while those aged 46 and over did not change. The number of admissions due to psychiatric conditions and overdoses was higher in April 2020 (p < 0.001). When viewed as a proportion of admissions, alcohol-related admissions (p = 0.004), psychiatric conditions and overdoses (p< 0.001) increased in April 2020 than in April 2019. The proportion of patients who were in hospital due to falls also increased in April 2020 (p< 0.001). In the same period, the absolute number and the proportion of admissions that were due to non-specific chest pain, to musculoskeletal complaints and patients who self-discharged prior to assessment decreased (p = 0.02, p = 0.01 and p = 0.002 respectively). There were no significant differences in non-COVID-related intensive care admissions or mortality between the same months in the two years. <h4>Conclusion</h4> In this large, single-centre study, there was a change in hospitalised case-mix when comparing April 2019 with April 2020: an increase in conditions which potentially reflect social isolation (falls, drug and alcohol misuse and psychiatric illness) and a decrease in conditions which rarely require in-patient hospital treatment (musculoskeletal pain and non-cardiac chest pain) especially among younger adults. These results highlight two areas for further research; the impact of social isolation on health and whether younger adults could be offered alternative health services to avoid potentially unnecessary hospital assessment.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/09/18/2020.09.15.20194795.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.15.20194795; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR215745; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR215745&type=FILE&fileName=EMS96159-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Prediction models should be externally validated to assess their performance before implementation. This observational cohort study aimed to validate published models of severity for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 using clinical and laboratory predictors. <h4>Methods</h4> Prediction models fitting relevant inclusion criteria were chosen for validation. The outcome was either mortality or a composite outcome of mortality and ICU admission (severe disease). 1295 patients admitted with symptoms of COVID-19 at Kings Cross Hospital (KCH) in London, United Kingdom, and 307 patients at Oslo University Hospital (OUH) in Oslo, Norway were included. The performance of the models was assessed in terms of discrimination and calibration. <h4>Results</h4> We identified two models for prediction of mortality (referred to as Xie and Zhang1) and two models for prediction of severe disease (Allenbach and Zhang2). The performance of the models was variable. For prediction of mortality Xie had good discrimination at OUH with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC) 0.87 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.79-0.95] and acceptable discrimination at KCH, AUROC 0.79 [0.76-0.82]. In prediction of severe disease, Allenbach had acceptable discrimination (OUH AUROC 0.81 [0.74-0.88] and KCH AUROC 0.72 [0.68-0.75]). The Zhang models had moderate to poor discrimination.

Orthodox (Haredi) Jewish neighbourhoods in England experienced high incidences of SARS-CoV-2 in 2020-21 and measles outbreaks (2018-19) due to suboptimal childhood vaccination coverage. The objective of our study was to explore how the coronavirus vaccination programme (CVP) was co-delivered between public health services and an Orthodox Jewish health organisation. <h4>Methods: </h4> included 28 semi-structured interviews conducted virtually with public health professionals, community welfare and religious representatives, and household members. We examined CVP delivery from the perspectives of those involved in organising services and vaccine beneficiaries. Interview data was contextualised within debates of the CVP in Orthodox (Haredi) Jewish print and social media. Thematic analysis generated five considerations: i) Prior immunisation-related collaboration with public health services carved a role for Jewish health organisations to host and promote coronavirus vaccination sessions, distribute appointments, and administer vaccines ii) Public health services maintained responsibility for training, logistics, and maintaining vaccination records; iii) The localised approach to service delivery promoted vaccination in a minority with historically suboptimal levels of coverage; iv) Co-delivery promoted trust in the CVP, though a minority of participants maintained concerns around safety; v) Provision of CVP information and stakeholders’ response to situated (context-specific) challenges and concerns. Drawing on this example of CVP co-delivery, we propose that a localised approach to delivering immunisation programmes could address service provision gaps in ways that involve trusted community organisations. Localisation of vaccination services can include communication or implementation strategies, but both approaches involve consideration of investment, engagement and coordination, which are not cost-neutral. Localising vaccination services in collaboration with welfare groups raises opportunities for the on-going CVP and other immunisation programmes, and constitutes an opportunity for ethnic and religious minorities to collaborate in safeguarding community health.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/09/15/2021.09.10.21263372.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.10.21263372; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR394718; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR394718&type=FILE&fileName=EMS135122-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Using data collected on a subset of 336,847 eligible UK users of the COVID Symptom Study app, we observed that 8.8% of the swab positive cases (total: 2,021 subjects) reported either a body rash or an acral rash, compared to 5.4% of those with a negative swab test (total: 25,136). Together, these two skin presentations showed an odds ratio (OR) of 1.67 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.41-1.96) for being swab positive.

To characterize the local and systemic immune responses associated with this form of ‘Long COVID’, we delineated the immune and proteomic landscape in the airway and peripheral blood of normal volunteers and patients from 3 to 6 months after hospital discharge. The bronchoalveolar lavage (but not peripheral blood) proteome was abnormal in patients with post-COVID19 lung disease with significantly elevated concentration of proteins associated with apoptosis, tissue repair and epithelial injury. This correlated with an increase in cytotoxic lymphocytes (especially tissue resident CD8 + T cells), lactate dehydrogenase and albumin (biomarkers of cell death and barrier integrity). Follow-up of a subset of these patients greater than 1-year post-COVID19 indicated these abnormalities resolved over time. Collectively, these data indicate that COVID-19 results in a prolonged change to the airway immune landscape in those with persistent lung disease, with evidence of cell death and tissue repair linked to ongoing activation of cytotoxic T cells. <h4>Highlights</h4> The post-COVID19 airway is characterized by increased cytotoxic lymphocytes. Distinct airway proteomes are associated with the airway immune cell landscape. The peripheral blood does not predict immune-proteome alterations in the airway post-COVID19.

However, with far fewer hospitalisations and deaths per case during the recent growth in cases compared with 2020, it is intended that all remaining social distancing legislation in England will be removed from 19 July 2021. <h4>Methods</h4> We report interim results from round 13 of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study in which a cross-sectional sample of the population of England was asked to provide a throat and nose swab for RT-PCR and to answer a questionnaire. Data collection for this report (round 13 interim) was from 24 June to 5 July 2021. <h4>Results</h4> In round 13 interim, we found 237 positives from 47,729 swabs giving a weighted prevalence of 0.59% (0.51%, 0.68%) which was approximately four-fold higher compared with round 12 at 0.15% (0.12%, 0.18%). This resulted from continued exponential growth in prevalence with an average doubling time of 15 (13, 17) days between round 12 and round 13. However, during the recent period of round 13 interim only, we observed a shorter doubling time of 6.1 (4.0, 12) days with a corresponding R number of 1.87 (1.40, 2.45). There were substantial increases in all age groups under the age of 75 years, and especially at younger ages, with the highest prevalence in 13 to 17 year olds at 1.33% (0.97%, 1.82%) and in 18 to 24 years olds at 1.40% (0.89%, 2.18%).

Overall, prevalence was over 3 times higher in the unvaccinated compared with those reporting two doses of vaccine in both round 12 and round 13 interim, although there was a similar proportional increase in prevalence in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals between the two rounds. <h4>Discussion</h4> We are entering a critical period with a number of important competing processes: continued vaccination rollout to the whole adult population in England, increased natural immunity through infection, reduced social mixing of children during school holidays, increased proportion of mixing occurring outdoors during summer, the intended full opening of hospitality and entertainment and cessation of mandated social distancing and mask wearing. Surveillance programmes are essential during this next phase of the epidemic to provide clear evidence to the government and the public on the levels and trends in prevalence of infections and their relationship to vaccine coverage, hospitalisations, deaths and Long COVID.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/07/08/2021.07.08.21260185.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.08.21260185; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR367549; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR367549&type=FILE&fileName=EMS130294-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

The real-time assessment of community transmission study (REACT-1) obtains throat and nose swabs from randomly selected people in England in order to describe patterns of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. Here, we report data from round 9a of REACT-1 for swabs collected between 4th and 13th February 2021. <h4>Results</h4> Out of 85,473 tested-swabs, 378 were positive. Overall weighted prevalence of infection in the community in England was 0.51%, a fall of more than two thirds since our last report (round 8) in January 2021 when 1.57% of people tested positive. We estimate a halving time of 14.6 days and a reproduction number R of 0.72, based on the difference in prevalence between the end of round 8 and the beginning of round 9. Although prevalence fell in all nine regions of England over the same period, there was greater uncertainty in the trend for North West, North East, and Yorkshire and The Humber. Prevalence fell substantially across all age groups with highest prevalence among 18- to 24-year olds at 0.89% (0.47%, 1.67%) and those aged 5 to12 years at 0.86% (0.60%, 1.24%). Large household size, living in a deprived neighbourhood, and Asian ethnicity were all associated with increased prevalence. Healthcare and care home workers were more likely to test positive compared to other workers. <h4>Conclusions</h4> There is a strong decline in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in England among the general population five to six weeks into lockdown, but prevalence remains high: at levels similar to those observed in late September 2020. Also, the number of COVID-19 cases in hospitals is higher than at the peak of the first wave in April 2020. The effects of easing of social distancing when we transition out of lockdown need to be closely monitored to avoid a resurgence in infections and renewed pressure on health services.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/02/23/2021.02.18.21251973.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.18.21251973; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR287082; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR287082&type=FILE&fileName=EMS117383-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We determined the prevalence and stability of nucleocapsid antibodies – the standard assay for detection of prior infection - in staff and residents from 201 LTCFs. <h4>Methods</h4> Prospective cohort study of residents aged >65 years and staff of LTCFs in England (11 June 2020-7 May 2021). Serial blood samples were tested for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Prevalence and cumulative incidence of antibody-positivity were weighted to the LTCF population. Cumulative incidence of sero-reversion was estimated from Kaplan-Meier curves. <h4>Results</h4> 9488 samples were included, 8636 (91%) of which could be individually-linked to 1434 residents or 3288 staff members. The cumulative incidence of nucleocapsid seropositivity was 35% (95% CI: 30-40%) in residents and 26% (95% CI: 23-30%) in staff over 11 months. The incidence rate of loss of antibodies (sero-reversion) was 2·1 per 1000 person-days at risk, and median time to reversion was around 8 months. <h4>Interpretation</h4> At least one-quarter of staff and one-third of surviving residents were infected during the first two pandemic waves. Nucleocapsid-specific antibodies often become undetectable within the first year following infection which is likely to lead to marked underestimation of the true proportion of those with prior infection. Since natural infection may act to boost vaccine responses, better assays to identify natural infection should be developed. <h4>Funding</h4> UK Government Department of Health and Social Care. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> A search was conducted of Ovid MEDLINE and MedRxiv on 21 July 2021 to identify studies conducted in long term care facilities (LTCF) that described seroprevalence using the terms “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2” and “nursing home” or “care home” or “residential” or “long term care facility” and “antibody” or “serology” without date or language restrictions. One meta-analysis was identified, published before the introduction of vaccination, that included 2 studies with a sample size of 291 which estimated seroprevalence as 59% in LTCF residents. There were 28 seroprevalence surveys of naturally-acquired SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in LTCFs; 16 were conducted in response to outbreaks and 12 conducted in care homes without known outbreaks. 16 studies included more than 1 LTCF and all were conducted in Autumn 2020 after the first wave of infection but prior to subsequent peaks. Seroprevalence studies conducted following a LTCF outbreak were biased towards positivity as the included population was known to have been previously infected. In the 12 studies that were conducted outside of known outbreaks, seroprevalence varied significantly according to local prevalence of infection. The largest of these was a cross-sectional study conducted in 9,000 residents and 10,000 staff from 362 LTCFs in Madrid, which estimated seroprevalence in staff as 31·5% and 55·4% in residents. However, as this study was performed in one city, it may not be generalisable to the whole of Spain and sequential sampling was not performed. Of the 28 studies, 9 undertook longitudinal sampling for a maximum of four months although three of these reported from the same cohort of LTCFs in London. None of the studies reported on antibody waning amongst the whole resident population. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> We estimated the proportion of care home staff and residents with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 natural infection using data from over 3,000 staff and 1,500 residents in 201 geographically dispersed LTCFs in England. Population selection was independent of outbreak history and the sample is therefore more reflective of the population who reside and work in LTCFs. Our estimates of the proportion of residents with prior natural infection are substantially higher than estimates based on population-wide PCR testing, due to limited testing coverage at the start of the pandemic. 1361 individuals had at least one positive antibody test and participants were followed for up to 11 months, which allowed modelling of the time to loss of antibody in over 600 individuals in whom the date of primary infection could be reliably estimated. This is the longest reported serological follow up in a population of LTCF residents, a group who are known to be most at risk of severe outcomes following infection with SARS-CoV-2 and provides important evidence on the duration that nucleocapsid antibodies remained detectable over the first and second waves of the pandemic. <h4>Implications of all available research</h4> A substantial proportion of the LTCF population will have some level of natural immunity to infection as a result of past infection. Immunological studies have highlighted greater antibody responses to vaccination in seropositive individuals, so vaccine efficacy in this population may be affected by this large pool of individuals who have survived past infection. In addition, although the presence of nucleocapsid-specific antibodies is generally considered as the standard marker for prior infection, we find that antibody waning is such that up to 50% of people will lose detectable antibody responses within eight months. Individual prior natural infection history is critical to assess the impact of factors such as vaccine response or protection against re-infection. These findings may have implications for duration of immunity following natural infection and indicate that alternative assays for prior infection should be developed.",,doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.21264166; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.21264166; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR401642; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR401642&type=FILE&fileName=EMS136680-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

This study aimed to examine the impact of multimorbidity, smoking status, and demographics (age, ethnic group, area of deprivation) on vaccine hesitancy among pregnant women in Wales using electronic health records (EHR) linkage. <h4>Methods</h4> This cohort study utilised routinely collected, individual-level, anonymised population-scale linked data within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. Pregnant women were identified from 13 th April 2021 to 31 st December 2021. Survival analysis was utilised to examine and compare the length of time to vaccination uptake in pregnancy by multimorbidity and smoking status, as well as depression, diabetes, asthma, and cardiovascular conditions independently. Variation in uptake by; multimorbidity, smoking status, and demographics was examined jointly and separately for the independent conditions using hazard ratios (HR) from the Cox regression model. A bootstrapping internal validation was conducted to assess the performance of the models. <h4>Results</h4> Within the population cohort, 8,203 (32.7%) received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy, with 8,572 (34.1%) remaining unvaccinated throughout the follow-up period, and 8,336 (33.2%) receiving the vaccine postpartum. Women aged 30 years or older were more likely to have the vaccine in pregnancy. Those who had depression were slightly but significantly more likely to have the vaccine compared to those without depression (HR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.14, p = 0.02). Women living with multimorbidity (> 1 health condition) were 1.12 times more likely to have the vaccine compared to those living without multimorbidity (HR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.19, p = 0.001). Vaccine uptakes were significantly lower among both current smokers and former smokers compared to never smokers (HR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.94, p < 0.001 and HR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.98, p = 0.015 respectively). Uptake was also lower among those living in the most deprived areas compared to those living in the most affluent areas (HR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.96, p = 0.002). The validated model had similar performance and revealed that multimorbidity, smoking status, age, and deprivation level together have a significant impact on vaccine hesitancy (p < 0.05 for all). <h4>Conclusion</h4> Younger women, living without multimorbidity (zero or only one health condition), current and former smokers, and those living in the more deprived areas are less likely to have the vaccine, thus, a targeted approach to vaccinations may be required for these groups.

We undertook a retrospective matched cohort study between 31st January 2020 and 15th April 2021 using data from a large database of UK-based primary care electronic health records, Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Aurum. We selected 486,149 adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS CoV-2 infection that had not been hospitalised within 28 days of the diagnosis (infected cohort). We propensity score matched them to 1,944,580 patients without a coded record of either confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (uninfected cohort).

Vaccine-induced immune responses are often attenuated in frail and older populations such as Long-Term Care Facility (LTCF) residents but published data are scarce. <h4>Methods</h4> VIVALDI is a prospective cohort study in England which links serial blood sampling in LTCF staff and residents to routine healthcare records. We measured quantitative titres of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike antibodies in residents and staff following second vaccination dose with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) or BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech).

Using data from the most recent two rounds, we estimate a doubling time of 10.6 (9.4, 12.0) days covering the period 20th August to 26th September, corresponding to a reproduction number R of 1.47 (1.40, 1.53). Using data only from round 5 we estimate a reproduction number of 1.06 (0.74, 1.46) with probability of 63% that R is greater than 1. Between rounds 4 and 5 there was a marked increase in unweighted prevalence at all ages. In the most recent data, prevalence was highest in the 18 to 24 yrs age group at 0.96% (0.68%, 1.36%). At 65+ yrs prevalence increased ∼7-fold between rounds 4 and 5 from 0.04% (0.03%, 0.07%) to 0.29% (0.23%, 0.37%). Prevalence increased in all regions between rounds 4 and 5, giving the highest unweighted prevalence in round 5 in the North West at 0.86% (0.69%, 1.06%). In London, prevalence increased ∼5-fold from 0.10% (0.06%, 0.17%) to 0.49% (0.36%, 0.68%). Regional R values ranged from 1.32 (1.16,1.50) in Yorkshire and the Humber to 1.63 (1.42, 1.88) in the East Midlands over the same period. In the most recent data, there was extensive clustering in the North West, Midlands and in and around London with pockets of clustering in other regions including the South West, North East and East of England. Odds of swab-positivity were ∼2-fold higher in people of Asian and Black ethnicity compared with white participants. <h4>Conclusion</h4> Rapid growth has led to high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in England among all regions and age groups, including those age groups at highest risk. Although there is evidence of a recent deceleration in the epidemic, current levels of prevalence will inevitably result in additional hospitalisations and mortality in coming weeks. A re-doubling of public health efforts is needed to return to a declining phase of the epidemic.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/10/02/2020.09.30.20204727.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.30.20204727; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR221538; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR221538&type=FILE&fileName=EMS97443-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

However, in some infected individuals, this can progress to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to multi-organ failure and death. The purpose of this study is to explore the proteomic differences between mild, severe and critical COVID-19 positive patients. Blood protein profiling was performed on 59 COVID-19 mild (n=26), severe (n=9) or critical (n=24) cases and 28 controls using the OLINK inflammation, autoimmune, cardiovascular and neurology panels. Differential expression analysis was performed within and between disease groups to generate nine different analyses. From the 368 proteins measured per individual, more than 75% were observed to be significantly perturbed in COVID-19 cases. Six proteins (IL6, CKAP4, Gal-9, IL-1ra, LILRB4 and PD-L1) were identified to be associated with disease severity. The results have been made readily available through an interactive web-based application for instant data exploration and visualization, and can be accessed at https://phidatalab-shiny.rosalind.kcl.ac.uk/COVID19/ .

Using hypertension as one example of the indirect impact of the pandemic, we observed 491,203 fewer individuals initiated antihypertensive treatment across England, Scotland and Wales during the period March 2020 to end May 2021 than would have been expected compared to 2019. We estimated that this missed antihypertension treatment could result in 13,659 additional CVD events should individuals remain untreated, including 2,281 additional myocardial infarctions (MIs) and 3,474 additional strokes. Incident use of lipid-lowering medicines decreased by an average 14,793 per month in early 2021 compared with the equivalent months prior to the pandemic in 2019. In contrast, the use of incident medicines to treat type-2 diabetes (T2DM) increased by approximately 1,642 patients per month. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Management of key CVD risk factors as proxied by incident use of CVD medicines has not returned to pre-pandemic levels in the UK.

Commercial/industrial access to routinely collected health data is especially controversial and sensitive for the public, and particular concerns may relate to mental health (MH) data. Existing best-practice MH data science guidelines do not cover commercial uses specifically, but emphasise the importance of patient/public co-development of data science. OBJECTIVES: To develop patient/public-led guidelines for the commercial/industrial use of MH data for research, and to capture relevant background information required by patient/public participants. The focus was on the UK and its constituent nations, but the principles may have wider applicability. METHODS: A patient/public lived experience advisory group (LEAG) was set up within DATAMIND, the Health Data Research UK data hub for MH informatics research development. Initial training and discussion yielded a requirement for definitions and explanations of concepts and processes relating to MH data research, developed iteratively. Subsequently, the LEAG developed guidelines via a qualitative and iterative quasi-Delphi approach. The agreed scope excluded data provided for research with informed consent, data processing arrangements such as companies hosting electronic health records or e-mail systems on the instruction of health services, or compliance with legal minimum requirements. The scope included the use of routinely collected MH data (e.g. NHS data) for research by commercial/industrial organisations without explicit consent, and aspects of MH data collection directly by industry with consent. RESULTS: Alongside the primer in MH data research concepts, the LEAG provide recommendations and best-practice guidelines relating to commercial/industrial research use of MH data, for organisations controlling MH data (such as NHS bodies) and for commercial applicants seeking to use MH data for research. Alongside principles of transparency, patient rights, patient/public involvement in research, stringent governance, and statistical disclosure control, the guidelines recommend a risk-benefit approach to assessing applications for data use, within limits that include avoiding the export of unconsented patient-level data outside NHS-controlled secure data environments, and not providing access to unconsented free-text MH data to commercial applicants. We also provide some recommendations for NHS executive and regulatory bodies, relating to public choice and transparency, clarity of guidance to research-active NHS organisations, and support for de-identification. CONCLUSIONS: Patient/public involvement and understanding is central to MH data research. The primer materials developed here constitute information requested by public advisers prior to considering best practice. The guidelines reflect the views of people with personal or family experience of mental ill health. We hope they are of practical use to the wider MH research community and serve to increase public transparency and trust.",,doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.05.25339575; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR1114707

A subsequent increase in community prevalence of infection could delay further relaxation of lockdown if vaccine uptake and efficacy are not sufficiently high to prevent increased pressure on healthcare services. <h4>Methods</h4> The PCR self-swab arm of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission Study (REACT-1) estimates community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in England based on random cross-sections of the population ages five and over. Here, we present results from the complete round 9 of REACT-1 comprising round 9a in which swabs were collected from 4th to 12th February 2021 and round 9b from 13th to 23rd February 2021. We also compare the results of REACT-1 round 9 to round 8, in which swabs were collected mainly from 6th January to 22nd January 2021. <h4>Results</h4> Out of 165,456 results for round 9 overall, 689 were positive. Overall weighted prevalence of infection in the community in England was 0.49% (0.44%, 0.55%), representing a fall of over two thirds from round 8. However the rate of decline of the epidemic has slowed from 15 (13, 17) days, estimated for the period from the end of round 8 to the start of round 9, to 31 days estimated using data from round 9 alone (lower confidence limit 17 days). When comparing round 9a to 9b there were apparent falls in four regions, no apparent change in one region and apparent rises in four regions, including London where there was a suggestion of sub-regional heterogeneity in growth and decline. Smoothed prevalence maps suggest large contiguous areas of growth and decline that do not align with administrative regions. Prevalence fell by 50% or more across all age groups in round 9 compared to round 8, with prevalence (round 9) ranging from 0.21% in those aged 65 and over to 0.71% in those aged 13 to 17 years. Round 9 prevalence was highest among Pakistani participants at 2.1% compared to white participants at 0.45% and Black participants at 0.83%. There were higher adjusted odds of infection for healthcare and care home workers, for those working in public transport and those working in education, school, nursery or childcare and lower adjusted odds for those not required to work outside the home. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Community prevalence of swab-positivity has declined markedly between January and February 2021 during lockdown in England, but remains high; the rate of decline has slowed in the most recent period, with a suggestion of pockets of growth. Continued adherence to social distancing and public health measures is required so that infection rates fall to much lower levels. This will help to ensure that the benefits of the vaccination roll-out programme in England are fully realised.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/03/06/2021.03.03.21252856.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.03.21252856; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR293368; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR293368&type=FILE&fileName=EMS118777-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We also studied other vascular events (transient ischaemic attack, haemorrhagic stroke, heart failure and angina). Hazard ratios were adjusted for demographic characteristics, previous disease diagnoses, comorbidities and medications. <h4>Results</h4> Among 48 million adults, 130,930 were and 1,315,471 were not hospitalised within 28 days of COVID-19. In England, there were 259,742 first arterial thromboses and 60,066 first VTE during 41.6 million person-years follow-up. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for first arterial thrombosis compared with no COVID-19 declined rapidly from 21.7 (95% CI 21.0-22.4) to 3.87 (3.58-4.19) in weeks 1 and 2 after COVID-19, 2.80 (2.61-3.01) during weeks 3-4 then to 1.34 (1.21-1.48) during weeks 27-49. aHRs for first VTE declined from 33.2 (31.3-35.2) and 8.52 (7.59-9.58) in weeks 1 and 2 to 7.95 (7.28-8.68) and 4.26 (3.86-4.69) during weeks 3-4 and 5-8, then 2.20 (1.99-2.44) and 1.80 (1.50-2.17) during weeks 13-26 and 27-49 respectively. aHRs were higher, for longer after diagnosis, after hospitalised than non-hospitalised COVID-19. aHRs were also higher among people of Black and Asian than White ethnicity and among people without than with a previous event. Across the whole population estimated increases in risk of arterial thromboses and VTEs were 2.5% and 0.6% respectively 49 weeks after COVID-19, corresponding to 7,197 and 3,517 additional events respectively after 1.4 million COVID-19 diagnoses. <h4>Conclusions and Relevance</h4> High rates of vascular disease early after COVID-19 diagnosis decline more rapidly for arterial thromboses than VTEs but rates remain elevated up to 49 weeks after COVID_19. These results support continued policies to avoid COVID-19 infection with effective COVID-19 vaccines and use of secondary preventive agents in high-risk patients. <h4>Key points</h4> <h4>Question</h4> Is COVID-19 associated with higher long-term incidence of vascular diseases? <h4>Findings</h4> In this cohort study of 48 million adults in England and Wales, COVID-19 was associated with higher incidence, that declined with time since diagnosis, of both arterial thromboses [week 1: adjusted HR [aHR] 21.7 (95% CI 21.0-22.4) weeks 27-49: aHR 1.34 (1.21-1.48)] and venous thromboembolism [week 1: aHR 33.2 (31.3-35.2), weeks 27–49 1.80 (1.50-2.17)]. aHRs were higher, for longer, after hospitalised than non-hospitalised COVID-19. The estimated excess number of arterial thromboses and venous thromboembolisms was 10,500. <h4>Meaning</h4> Avoidance of COVID-19 infection through vaccination, and use of secondary preventive agents after infection in high-risk patients, may reduce post-COVID-19 acute vascular diseases.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/11/24/2021.11.22.21266512.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.22.21266512; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR425049; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR425049&type=FILE&fileName=EMS140221-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Information on 88 potential sociodemographic, behavioural, nutritional, clinical and pharmacological risk factors was obtained through online questionnaires, and combined IgG/IgA/IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein were determined in dried blood spots obtained between November 6, 2020 and April 18, 2021. We used logistic and linear regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and adjusted geometric mean ratios (aGMRs) for potential determinants of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity (all participants) and antibody titres (seropositive participants only), respectively. <h4>Results</h4> 1696 (15.2%) of 11,130 participants were seropositive. Factors independently associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity included frontline health/care occupation (aOR 1.86, 95% CI 1.48–2.33), international travel (1.20, 1.07–1.35), number of visits to shops and other indoor public places (≥5 vs. 0/week: 1.29, 1.06-1.57, P-trend=0.01), body mass index (BMI) ≥25 vs <25 kg/m 2 (1.24, 1.11–1.39), Asian/Asian British vs White ethnicity (1.65, 1.10–2.49), and alcohol consumption ≥15 vs 0 units/week (1.23, 1.04–1.46).

Recognised associations between Asian/Asian British ethnic origin and obesity and increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity were independent of other sociodemographic, behavioural, nutritional, clinical and pharmacological factors investigated. Among seropositive participants, higher titres of anti-Spike antibodies in people of Asian ancestry and in obese people were not explained by greater COVID-19 disease severity in these groups. <h4>Funding</h4> Barts Charity, Health Data Research UK.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/01/08/2021.11.02.21265767.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.02.21265767; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR415629; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR415629&type=FILE&fileName=EMS138031-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We investigated the relationship between the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and subsequent infection in this population. <h4>Methods</h4> Prospective cohort study of infection in staff and residents in 100 LTCFs in England between October 2020 and February 2021. Blood samples were collected at baseline (June 2020), 2 and 4 months and tested for IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid and spike protein. PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was undertaken weekly in staff and monthly in residents. The primary analysis estimated the relative hazard of a PCR-positive test by baseline antibody status, from Cox regression adjusted for age and gender, and stratified by LTCF. <h4>Findings</h4> Study inclusion criteria were met by 682 residents and 1429 staff. Baseline IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid were detected in 226 residents (33%) and 408 staff (29%). A total of 93 antibody-negative residents had a PCR-positive test (0.054 per month at risk) compared to 4 antibody-positive residents (0.007 per month at risk). There were 111 PCR-positive tests in antibody-negative staff (0.042 per month at risk) compared to 10 in antibody-positive staff (0.009 per month at risk). The adjusted hazard ratios for reinfection in staff and residents with a baseline positive versus negative antibody test were 0.13 (95% CI 0.05-0.40) and 0.39 ((95% CI: 0.19-0.77) respectively. Of 12 reinfected participants with data on symptoms, 11 were symptomatic. Antibody titres to spike and nucleocapsid were comparable in PCR-positive and PCR-negative cases. <h4>Interpretation</h4> The presence of IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid was associated with substantially reduced risk of reinfection in staff and residents for up to 10 months after primary infection. <h4>Funding</h4> UK Government Department of Health and Social Care <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE (Ovid) and MedRxiv on 18 January 2021 for studies in LTCFs that described the risk of infection in individuals who were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 compared to individuals who were seronegative. Search terms were deliberately broad to improve capture of relevant literature and included “SARS-CoV-2”OR “COVID-19” OR “coronavirus” AND “care home” OR “nursing home” OR “long term care facility” with no date or language restrictions. We did not identify any publications that focussed on risk of reinfection in seropositive individuals, but subsequent to our search one study has been published using data from two LTCFs in London, UK. This study reported a 96% reduction in the odds of reinfection in individuals who were seropositive compared to those who were seronegative based on 4-month follow-up in 161 participants. We found 10 studies that performed seroprevalence surveys in either staff or staff and residents in LTCFs in 8 cohorts. Five of these were carried out in response to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks within the care homes, either as part of the subsequent investigation or as post-infection surveillance. The largest of these, which enrolled both staff and residents, was performed in 6 LTCFs and performed longitudinal antibody testing. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> We undertook a cohort study in staff and residents from 100 LTCFs in England to investigate whether individuals with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection could be infected twice. Staff and residents were offered up to three rounds of antibody testing and antibody results were linked to PCR test results which were obtained weekly from staff and monthly from residents through the national SARS-CoV-2 testing programme. This study, which was conducted in >2000 staff and residents, suggests that antibodies provide high levels of protection against reinfection for up to 10 months. Almost all cases of reinfection were symptomatic, but no cases required hospital treatment. Amongst those with detectable baseline antibodies, quantitative antibody titres against spike protein and nucleocapsid were comparable between cases of reinfection and those who did not become reinfected. <h4>Implications of all available evidence</h4> Despite high background rates of infection in LTCFs, the overall risk of reinfection was low in this population. This is broadly consistent with findings from large cohort studies of hospital staff, but, importantly, extends the evidence of substantial protection to frail elderly, who are vulnerable to severe outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 due to age-related changes in immunity (immune-senescence) and high levels of comorbidity. The low risk of reinfection in our study suggests identification of immune correlates of protection in this population will require pooling of data across multiple cohorts. As vaccination coverage in residents approaches 100% in England, it will be important to understand whether vaccination and natural infection provide comparable levels of protection against infection. Such insights will inform future policy decisions regarding re-vaccination schedules in LTCF, and the longer-term need for non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, such as asymptomatic testing and visitor restrictions.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/03/10/2021.03.08.21253110.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.08.21253110; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR294758; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR294758&type=FILE&fileName=EMS119128-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Although severity of Omicron cases may be reduced, the scale of infection suggests hospital admissions and deaths may be substantial. Definitive conclusions about disease severity require evidence from populations with the greatest risk of severe outcomes, such as residents of Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCFs). <h4>Methods</h4>  We used a cohort study to compare the risk of hospital admission or death in LTCF residents in England who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the period shortly before Omicron emerged (Delta dominant) and the Omicron-dominant period, adjusting for age, sex, vaccine type, and booster vaccination. Variants were confirmed by sequencing or spike-gene status in a subset. <h4>Results</h4>  Risk of hospital admission was markedly lower in 1241 residents infected in the Omicron-period (4.01% hospitalised, 95% CI: 2.87-5.59) compared to 398 residents infected in the pre-Omicron period (10.8% hospitalised, 95% CI: 8.13-14.29, adjusted Hazard Ratio 0.50, 95% CI: 0.29-0.87, p=0.014); findings were similar in residents with confirmed variant. No residents with previous infection were hospitalised in either period. Mortality was lower in the Omicron versus the pre-Omicron period, (p<0.0001). <h4>Conclusions</h4>  Risk of severe outcomes in LTCF residents with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant was substantially lower than that seen for previous variants. This suggests the current wave of Omicron infections is unlikely to lead to a major surge in severe disease in LTCF populations with high levels of vaccine coverage and/or natural immunity. <h4>Trial Registration Number</h4>  ISRCTN 14447421",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/01/27/2022.01.21.22269605.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.21.22269605; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR445654; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR445654&type=FILE&fileName=EMS142621-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

It has been suggested that ACE-inhibitors (ACEi) and Angiotensin-2 Blockers (ARB), which are commonly used in patients with hypertension or diabetes and may raise ACE2 levels, could increase the risk of severe COVID19 infection. <h4>Methods and Results</h4> We evaluated this hypothesis in a consecutive cohort of 1200 acute inpatients with COVID19 at two hospitals with a multi-ethnic catchment population in London (UK). The mean age was 68±17 years (57% male) and 74% of patients had at least 1 comorbidity. 415 patients (34.6%) reached the primary endpoint of death or transfer to a critical care unit for organ support within 21-days of symptom onset. 399 patients (33.3 %) were taking ACEi or ARB. Patients on ACEi/ARB were significantly older and had more comorbidities. The odds ratio (OR) for the primary endpoint in patients on ACEi and ARB, after adjustment for age, sex and co-morbidities, was 0.63 (CI 0.47-0.84, p<0.01). <h4>Conclusions</h4> There was no evidence for increased severity of COVID19 disease in hospitalised patients on chronic treatment with ACEi or ARB.

We evaluated the use of a higher dose of corticosteroids in this patient group. <h4>Methods</h4> This randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]) is assessing multiple possible treatments in patients hospitalised for COVID-19. Eligible and consenting adult patients with clinical evidence of hypoxia (i.e. receiving oxygen or with oxygen saturation <92% on room air) were randomly allocated (1:1) to either usual care with higher dose corticosteroids (dexamethasone 20 mg once daily for 5 days followed by 10 mg once daily for 5 days or until discharge if sooner) or usual standard of care alone (which includes dexamethasone 6 mg once daily for 10 days or until discharge if sooner). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. On 11 May 2022, the independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended stopping recruitment of patients receiving no oxygen or simple oxygen only to this comparison due to safety concerns. We report the results for these participants only. Recruitment of patients receiving ventilatory support continues. The RECOVERY trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT04381936 ). <h4>Findings</h4> Between 25 May 2021 and 12 May 2022, 1272 COVID-19 patients with hypoxia and receiving no oxygen (1%) or simple oxygen only (99%) were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus higher dose corticosteroids versus usual care alone (of whom 87% received low dose corticosteroids during the follow-up period). Of those randomised, 745 (59%) were in Asia, 512 (40%) in the UK and 15 (1%) in Africa. 248 (19%) had diabetes mellitus. Overall, 121 (18%) of 659 patients allocated to higher dose corticosteroids versus 75 (12%) of 613 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio [RR] 1·56; 95% CI 1·18-2·06; p=0·0020). There was also an excess of pneumonia reported to be due to non-COVID infection (10% vs. 6%; absolute difference 3.7%; 95% CI 0.7-6.6) and an increase in hyperglycaemia requiring increased insulin dose (22% vs. 14%; absolute difference 7.4%; 95% CI 3.2-11.5). <h4>Interpretation</h4> In patients hospitalised for COVID-19 with clinical hypoxia but requiring either no oxygen or simple oxygen only, higher dose corticosteroids significantly increased the risk of death compared to usual care, which included low dose corticosteroids. The RECOVERY trial continues to assess the effects of higher dose corticosteroids in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 who require non-invasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation. <h4>Funding</h4> UK Research and Innovation (Medical Research Council) and National Institute of Health and Care Research (Grant ref: MC_PC_19056), and Wellcome Trust (Grant Ref: 222406/Z/20/Z).",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/12/17/2022.12.16.22283578.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.16.22283578; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR585732; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR585732&type=FILE&fileName=EMS158665-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

DNAse 1 activity was measured, alongside circulating levels of cfDNA, MPO, VEGF, IL-6 and sTNFRI. All measurements were correlated to clinical outcome. Serial sampling on day 3-5 post hospitalisation were also measured. <h4>Results</h4> Compared to AMC, COVID-19 neutrophils demonstrated elevated transmigration (p=0.0397) and NETosis (p=0.0366), but impaired phagocytosis (p=0.0236) associated with impaired ROS generation (p<0.0001). Surface expression of CD54 (p<0.0001) and CD11c (p=0.0008) was significantly increased and CD11b significantly decreased (p=0.0229) on COVID-19 patient neutrophils.

We aimed to describe and compare the demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes of obese patients with COVID-19 to those of non-obese patients with COVID-19, or obese patients with seasonal influenza. <h4>Methods</h4> We conducted a cohort study based on outpatient/inpatient care, and claims data from January to June 2020 from the US, Spain, and the UK. We used six databases standardized to the OMOP common data model. We defined two cohorts of patients diagnosed and/or hospitalized with COVID-19. We created corresponding cohorts for patients with influenza in 2017-2018. We followed patients from index date to 30 days or death. We report the frequency of socio-demographics, prior comorbidities, and 30-days outcomes (hospitalization, events, and death) by obesity status. <h4>Findings</h4> We included 627 044 COVID-19 (US: 502 650, Spain: 122 058, UK: 2336) and 4 549 568 influenza (US: 4 431 801, Spain: 115 224, UK: 2543) patients. The prevalence of obesity was higher among hospitalized COVID-19 (range: 38% to 54%) than diagnosed COVID-19 (30% to 47%), or diagnosed (15% to 47%) or hospitalized (27% to 48%) influenza patients. Obese hospitalized COVID-19 patients were more often female and younger than non-obese COVID-19 patients or obese influenza patients. Obese COVID-19 patients were more likely to have prior comorbidities, present with cardiovascular and respiratory events during hospitalization, require intensive services, or die compared to non-obese COVID-19 patients. Obese COVID-19 patients were more likely to require intensive services or die compared to obese influenza patients, despite presenting with fewer comorbidities. <h4>Interpretation</h4> We show that obesity is more common amongst COVID-19 than influenza patients, and that obese patients present with more severe forms of COVID-19 with higher hospitalization, intensive services, and fatality than non-obese patients. These data are instrumental for guiding preventive strategies of COVID-19 infection and complications. <h4>Funding</h4> The European Health Data & Evidence Network has received funding from the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking (JU) under grant agreement No 806968.

We searched PubMed for articles published from December 2019 until June 2020, using terms referring to SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 combined with terms for obesity. Few studies reported obesity and most of them were limited by small sample sizes and restricted to hospitalized patients. Further, they used different definitions for obesity (i.e. some reported together overweight and obesity, others only reported obesity with BMI>40kg/m 2 ). To date, no study has provided detailed information on the characteristics of obese COVID-19 patients, such as the prevalence of comorbidities or COVID-19 related outcomes. In addition, despite the fact that COVID-19 has been often compared to seasonal influenza, there are no studies assessing whether obese patients with COVID-19 differ from obese patients with seasonal influenza. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> We report the largest cohort of obese patients with COVID-19 and provide information on more than 29 000 aggregate characteristics publicly available. Our findings were consistent across the participating databases and countries. We found that the prevalence of obesity is higher among COVID-19 compared to seasonal influenza patients. Obese patients with COVID-19 are more commonly female and have worse outcomes than non-obese patients. Further, they have worse outcomes than obese patients with influenza, despite presenting with fewer comorbidities. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Our results show that individuals with obesity present more comorbidities and worse outcomes for COVID-19 than non-obese patients. These findings may be useful in guiding clinical practice and future preventative strategies for obese individuals, as well as provide useful data to support subsequent association studies focussed on obesity and COVID-19.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/09/03/2020.09.02.20185173.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.02.20185173; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR208611; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR208611&type=FILE&fileName=EMS94639-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

In order to identify and characterize individual trajectories, we defined and validated ten COVID-19 phenotypes from linked electronic health records (EHR) on a nationwide scale using an extensible framework. <h4>Methods</h4> Cohort study of 56.6 million people in England alive on 23/01/2020, followed until 31/05/2021, using eight linked national datasets spanning COVID-19 testing, vaccination, primary & secondary care and death registrations data. We defined ten COVID-19 phenotypes reflecting clinically relevant stages of disease severity using a combination of international clinical terminologies (e.g. SNOMED-CT, ICD-10) and bespoke data fields; positive test, primary care diagnosis, hospitalisation, critical care (four phenotypes), and death (three phenotypes). Using these phenotypes, we constructed patient trajectories illustrating the transition frequency and duration between phenotypes. Analyses were stratified by pandemic waves and vaccination status. <h4>Findings</h4> We identified 3,469,528 infected individuals (6.1%) with 8,825,738 recorded COVID-19 phenotypes. Of these, 364,260 (11%) were hospitalised and 140,908 (4%) died. Of those hospitalised, 38,072 (10%) were admitted to intensive care (ICU), 54,026 (15%) received non-invasive ventilation and 21,404 (6%) invasive ventilation. Amongst hospitalised patients, first wave mortality (30%) was higher than the second (23%) in non-ICU settings, but remained unchanged for ICU patients. The highest mortality was for patients receiving critical care outside of ICU in wave 1 (51%). 13,083 (9%) COVID-19 related deaths occurred without diagnoses on the death certificate, but within 30 days of a positive test while 10,403 (7%) of cases were identified from mortality data alone with no prior phenotypes recorded. We observed longer patient trajectories in the second pandemic wave compared to the first. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Our analyses illustrate the wide spectrum of severity that COVID-19 displays and significant differences in incidence, survival and pathways across pandemic waves. We provide an adaptable framework to answer questions of clinical and policy relevance; new variant impact, booster dose efficacy and a way of maximising existing data to understand individuals progression through disease states. <h4>Research in Context</h4> <h4>Evidence before the study</h4> We searched PubMed on October 14, 2021, for publications with the terms “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2”, “severity”, and “electronic health records” or “EHR” without date or language restrictions. Multiple studies explore factors associated with severity of COVID-19 infection, and model predictions of outcome for hospitalised patients. However, most work to date focused on isolated facets of the healthcare system, such as primary or secondary care only, was conducted in subpopulations (e.g. hospitalised patients) of limited sample size, and often utilized dichotomised outcomes (e.g. mortality or hospitalisation) ignoring the full spectrum of disease. We identified no studies which comprehensively detailed severity of infections while describing disease severity across pandemic waves, vaccination status, and patient trajectories. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> To our knowledge, this is the first study providing a comprehensive view of COVID-19 across pandemic waves using national data and focusing on severity, vaccination, and patient trajectories. Drawing on linked electronic health record (EHR) data on a national scale (56.6 million people alive and registered with GP in England), we describe key demographic factors, frequency of comorbidities, impact of the two main waves in England, and effect of full vaccination on COVID-19 severities. Additionally, we identify and describe patient trajectory networks which illustrate the main transition pathways of COVID-19 patients in the healthcare system. Finally, we provide reproducible COVID-19 phenotyping algorithms reflecting clinically relevant stages of disease severity i.e. positive tests, primary care diagnoses, hospitalisation, critical care treatments (e.g. ventilatory support) and mortality. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> The COVID-19 phenotypes and trajectory analysis framework outlined produce a reproducible, extensible and repurposable means to generate national-scale data to support critical policy decision making. By modelling patient trajectories as a series of interactions with healthcare systems, and linking these to demographic and outcome data, we provide a means to identify and prioritise care pathways associated with adverse outcomes and highlight healthcare system ‘touch points’ which may act as tangible targets for intervention.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/11/09/2021.11.08.21265312.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.08.21265312; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR417361; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR417361&type=FILE&fileName=EMS138265-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We excluded correspondence, area level, modelling and basic science articles. Two independent reviewers screened articles for inclusion. Of 926 identified articles, 35 were included in the meta-analyses. <h4>Data Extraction and Synthesis</h4> The review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Reviewers independently extracted data using a piloted form on: (1) rates of infection, ICU admission and mortality by ethnicity; and (2) unadjusted and adjusted data comparing ethnic minority and White groups. Data were pooled using random effects models. <h4>Main Outcomes and Measures</h4> Outcomes were: (1) infection with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed on molecular testing; (2) ICU admission; and (3) mortality in COVID-19 confirmed and suspected cases. <h4>Results</h4> 13,535,562 patients from 35 studies were included in the meta-analyses. Black, Asian and Hispanic individuals had a greater risk of infection compared to White individuals (Black: pooled adjusted RR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.59-2.67; Asian: 1.35, 95%CI: 1.15-1.59; Hispanic: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.39-2.25). Black individuals were significantly more likely to be admitted to ICU than White individuals (pooled adjusted RR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.02-2.55). Risk of mortality was similar across ethnicities among hospitalised patients, but increased among Asian and Mixed ethnic groups in the general population. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Black, Asian and Hispanic ethnic groups are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Black individuals may be more likely to require ICU admission for COVID-19. There may also be disparities in risk of death from COVID-19 at a population level. Our findings are of critical public health importance and should inform policy on minimising SARS-CoV-2 exposure in ethnic minority groups. <h4>KEY POINTS</h4> <h4>Question</h4> Is ethnicity associated with vulnerability to, and outcomes from, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)? <h4>Findings</h4> In this systematic review and meta-analysis, rates of infection and outcomes from COVID-19 were compared between ethnic groups. Individuals from Black, Asian and Hispanic ethnicity were significantly more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection than those of White ethnicity. Black individuals were more likely to need intensive care unit (ICU) admission for COVID-19 than White individuals. Risk of mortality was similar across ethnicities among hospitalised patients, but increased among Asian and Mixed ethnic groups in the general population. <h4>Meaning</h4> There is strong evidence for an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst ethnic minorities, and targeted public health policies are required to reduce this risk.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/09/08/2020.09.05.20188821.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.05.20188821; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR211110; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.05.20188821

Concerns have been raised that HCWs from ethnic minority groups are more likely to be vaccine hesitant (defined by the World Health Organisation as refusing or delaying a vaccination) than those of White ethnicity, but there are limited data on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy and its predictors in UK HCWs. <h4>Methods</h4> Nationwide prospective cohort study and qualitative study in a multi-ethnic cohort of clinical and non-clinical UK HCWs. We analysed ethnic differences in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy adjusting for demographics, vaccine trust, and perceived risk of COVID-19. We explored reasons for hesitancy in qualitative data using a framework analysis. <h4>Findings</h4> 11,584 HCWs were included in the cohort analysis. 23% (2704) reported vaccine hesitancy. Compared to White British HCWs (21.3% hesitant), HCWs from Black Caribbean (54.2%), Mixed White and Black Caribbean (38.1%), Black African (34.4%), Chinese (33.1%), Pakistani (30.4%), and White Other (28.7%) ethnic groups were significantly more likely to be hesitant. In adjusted analysis, Black Caribbean (aOR 3.37, 95% CI 2.11 - 5.37), Black African (aOR 2.05, 95% CI 1.49 - 2.82), White Other ethnic groups (aOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.19 - 1.84) were significantly more likely to be hesitant. Other independent predictors of hesitancy were younger age, female sex, higher score on a COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs scale, lower trust in employer, lack of influenza vaccine uptake in the previous season, previous COVID-19, and pregnancy. Qualitative data from 99 participants identified the following contributors to hesitancy: lack of trust in government and employers, safety concerns due to the speed of vaccine development, lack of ethnic diversity in vaccine studies, and confusing and conflicting information. Participants felt uptake in ethnic minority communities might be improved through inclusive communication, involving HCWs in the vaccine rollout, and promoting vaccination through trusted networks. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Despite increased risk of COVID-19, HCWs from some ethnic minority groups are more likely to be vaccine hesitant than their White British colleagues. Strategies to build trust and dispel myths surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine in these communities are urgently required. Public health communications should be inclusive, non-stigmatising and utilise trusted networks. <h4>Funding</h4> MRC-UK Research and Innovation (MR/V027549/1), the Department of Health and Social Care through the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), and NIHR Biomedical Research Centres and NIHR Applied Research Collaboration East Midlands. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We searched Pubmed using the following search terms ((COVID-19).ti,ab OR (SARS-CoV-2).ti,ab) AND ((vaccine).ti,ab OR (vaccination).ti,ab OR (immunisation).ti,ab)) AND ((healthcare worker).ti,ab OR (health worker).ti,ab OR (doctor).ti,ab OR (nurse).ti,ab OR (healthcare professional).ti,ab)) AND ((hesitancy).ti,ab OR (refusal).ti,ab OR (uptake).ti,ab)). The search returned 60 results, of which 38 were excluded after title and abstract screening, 11 studies were not conducted in a population of healthcare workers, 20 did not present data on vaccine intention or uptake, 5 were related to vaccines other than the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, 1 was unrelated to vaccination and 1 had been withdrawn. The 22 remaining articles were survey studies focussed on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine intention in healthcare workers. Estimates of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine acceptance varied widely from 27·7% - 94·5% depending on the country in which the study was performed, and the occupational group studied. Only 2 studies (both conducted in the USA) had a sample size greater than 10,000. Most studies found females, non-medical healthcare staff and those refusing influenza vaccine to be more likely to be hesitant. There was conflicting evidence about the effects of age and previous COVID-19 on hesitancy. Only 3 studies (all from the USA), presented data disaggregated by ethnicity, all finding Black ethnic HCWs were most likely to be hesitant. Common themes amongst studies that investigated reasons for vaccine hesitancy were concerns about safety of vaccines, fear of side effects and short development timeframes. We did not find any studies on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy in UK healthcare workers in the published literature. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> This study is amongst the largest SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy studies in the literature. It is the largest study outside the USA and is the only study in UK HCWs. Our work focusses on the association of ethnicity with vaccine hesitancy, and we are the first study outside the USA to present results by ethnic group. The large number of ethnic minority HCWs in our study allows for examination of the outcome by more granular ethnicity categories than have previously been studied, allowing us to detect important differences in vaccine hesitancy levels within the broad White and Asian ethnic groupings. Our large sample size and the richness of our cohort study dataset allows us to control for many potential confounders in our multivariable analysis, and provide novel data on important potential drivers of hesitancy including discrimination, COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, religion/religiosity and personality traits. Additionally, we combine quantitative with qualitative data providing a deeper understanding of the drivers of hesitancy and potential strategies to improve vaccine uptake in HCWs from ethnic minority communities. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Around a quarter of UK healthcare workers reported SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy. In accordance with previous studies in other countries, we determined that female sex and lack of influenza vaccine in the previous season were important predictors of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy in UK HCWs, although in contrast to most studies in the published literature, after adjustment we do not demonstrate differences in hesitancy levels by occupational role. Importantly, previous literature provides conflicting evidence of the effects of age and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection on vaccine hesitancy. In our study, younger HCWs and those with evidence of previous COVID-19 were more likely to be hesitant. This study provides novel data on increased hesitancy levels within Black Caribbean, Mixed White and Black Caribbean, Black African, Chinese, Pakistani and White Other ethnic groups. Mistrust (of vaccines in general, in SARS-CoV-2 vaccines specifically, in healthcare systems and research) and misinformation appear to be important drivers of hesitancy within HCWS in the UK. Our data indicate that despite facing an increased risk of COVID-19 compared to their White colleagues, UK HCWs from some ethnic minority groups continue to exhibit greater levels of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy. This study provides policy makers with evidence to inform strategies to improve uptake.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/05/19/2021.04.26.21255788.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.26.21255788; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR316137; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR316137&type=FILE&fileName=EMS123592-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Amplicon sequencing has proven very effective for sequencing SARS-CoV-2, but prevalent mutations disrupting primer binding sites have necessitated the revision of sequencing protocols in order to maintain performance for emerging virus lineages. We compared the performance of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) Midnight and ARTIC tiling amplicon protocols using 196 Delta lineage SARS-CoV-2 clinical specimens, and 71 mostly Omicron lineage samples with S gene target failure (SGTF), reflecting circulating lineages in the United Kingdom during December 2021. 96-plexed nanopore sequencing was used. For Delta lineage samples, ARTIC v4 recovered the greatest proportion of ≥90% complete genomes (81.1%; 159/193), followed by Midnight (71.5%; 138/193) and ARTIC v3 (34.1%; 14/41). Midnight protocol however yielded higher average genome recovery (mean 98.8%) than ARTIC v4 (98.1%) and ARTIC v3 (75.4%), resulting in less ambiguous final consensus assemblies overall. Explaining these observations were ARTIC v4’s superior genome recovery in low viral titre/high cycle threshold (Ct) samples and inferior performance in high titre/low Ct samples, where Midnight excelled. We evaluated Omicron sequencing performance using a revised Midnight primer mix alongside prototype ARTIC v4.1 primers, head-to-head with the existing commercially available Midnight and ARTIC v4 protocols. The revised protocols both improved considerably the recovery of Omicron genomes and exhibited similar overall performance to one another. Revised Midnight protocol recovered ≥90% complete genomes for 85.9% (61/71) of Omicron samples vs. 88.7% (63/71) for ARTIC v4.1.

However, there is insufficient evidence on how demographic and occupational factors influence infection risk among ethnic minority HCWs. <h4>Methods</h4> We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from the United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity And COVID-19 Outcomes in Healthcare workers (UK-REACH) cohort study. We used logistic regression to examine associations of demographic, household and occupational predictor variables with SARS-CoV-2 infection (defined by PCR, serology or suspected COVID-19) in a diverse group of HCWs. <h4>Results</h4> 2,496 of the 10,772 HCWs (23.2%) who worked during the first UK national lockdown in March 2020 reported previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. In an adjusted model, demographic and household factors associated with increased odds of infection included younger age, living with other key workers and higher religiosity. Important occupational risk factors associated with increased odds of infection included attending to a higher number of COVID-19 positive patients (aOR 2.49, 95%CI 2.03–3.05 for ≥21 patients per week vs none), working in a nursing or midwifery role (1.35, 1.15– 1.58, compared to doctors), reporting a lack of access to personal protective equipment (1.27, 1.15 – 1.41) and working in an ambulance (1.95, 1.52–2.50) or hospital inpatient setting (1.54, 1.37 – 1.74). Those who worked in Intensive Care Units were less likely to have been infected (0.76, 0.63–0.90) than those who did not. Black HCWs were more likely to have been infected than their White colleagues, an effect which attenuated after adjustment for other known predictors. <h4>Conclusions</h4> We identified key sociodemographic and occupational risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst UK HCWs, and have determined factors that might contribute to a disproportionate odds of infection in HCWs from Black ethnic groups. These findings demonstrate the importance of social and occupational factors in driving ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes, and should inform policies, including targeted vaccination strategies and risk assessments aimed at protecting HCWs in future waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. <h4>Trial registration</h4> ISRCTN 11811602",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/12/17/2021.12.16.21267934.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.16.21267934; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR433539; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR433539&type=FILE&fileName=EMS141796-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We estimated the contribution of “misclassified” cases and transmission from “missed” symptomatic infections to the English epidemic before 31st July 2020. <h4>Findings</h4> In our dataset of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in acute English Trusts with a recorded symptom onset date (n = 65,028), 7% were classified as hospital-acquired (with symptom onset 8 or more days after admission and before discharge). We estimated that only 30% (range across weeks and 200 simulations: 20-41%) of symptomatic hospital-acquired infections would be identified. Misclassified cases and onward transmission from missed infections could account for 15% (mean, 95% range over 200 simulations: 14·1%-15·8%) of cases currently classified as community-acquired COVID-19. From this, we estimated that 26,600 (25,900 to 27,700) individuals acquired a symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in an acute Trust in England before 31st July 2020, resulting in 15,900 (15,200-16,400) or 20.1% (19.2%-20.7%) of all identified hospitalised COVID-19 cases. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to hospitalised patients likely caused approximately a fifth of identified cases of hospitalised COVID-19 in the “first wave”, but fewer than 1% of all SARS-CoV-2 infections in England. Using symptom onset as a detection method for hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 likely misses a substantial proportion (>60%) of hospital-acquired infections. <h4>Funding</h4> National Institute for Health Research, UK Medical Research Council, Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening, UKRI, Wellcome Trust, Singapore National Medical Research Council. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We searched PubMed with the terms “((national OR country) AND (contribution OR burden OR estimates) AND (“hospital-acquired” OR “hospital-associated” OR “nosocomial”)) AND Covid-19” for articles published in English up to July 1st 2021. This identified 42 studies, with no studies that had aimed to produce comprehensive national estimates of the contribution of hospital settings to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most studies focused on estimating seroprevalence or levels of infection in healthcare workers only, which were not our focus. Removing the initial national/country terms identified 120 studies, with no country level estimates. Several single hospital setting estimates exist for England and other countries, but the percentage of hospital-associated infections reported relies on identified cases in the absence of universal testing. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> This study provides the first national-level estimates of all symptomatic hospital-acquired infections with SARS-CoV-2 in England up to the 31st July 2020. Using comprehensive data, we calculate how many infections would be unidentified and hence can generate a total burden, impossible from just notification data. Moreover, our burden estimates for onward transmission suggest the contribution of hospitals to the overall infection burden. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Large numbers of patients may become infected with SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals though only a small proportion of such infections are identified. Further work is needed to better understand how interventions can reduce such transmission and to better understand the contributions of hospital transmission to mortality.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/09/10/2021.09.02.21262480.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.02.21262480; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR393066; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR393066&type=FILE&fileName=EMS134823-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We report the preliminary results for the comparison of hydroxychloroquine vs. usual care alone. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. <h4>Results</h4> 1561 patients randomly allocated to receive hydroxychloroquine were compared with 3155 patients concurrently allocated to usual care. Overall, 418 (26.8%) patients allocated hydroxychloroquine and 788 (25.0%) patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96 to 1.23; P=0.18). Consistent results were seen in all pre-specified subgroups of patients. Patients allocated to hydroxychloroquine were less likely to be discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (60.3% vs. 62.8%; rate ratio 0.92; 95% CI 0.85-0.99) and those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline were more likely to reach the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (29.8% vs. 26.5%; risk ratio 1.12; 95% CI 1.01-1.25).

We calculated vaccination rates and estimated unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios using logistic regression models. <h4>Results</h4> By 15 March 2021, 93.2% of people living in England aged 70 years and over had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. While vaccination rates differed across all factors considered apart from sex, the greatest disparities were seen between ethnic and religious groups. The lowest rates were in people of Black African and Black Caribbean ethnic backgrounds, where only 67.2% and 73.9% had received a vaccine, with adjusted odds of not being vaccinated at 5.01 (95% CI 4.86 - 5.16) and 4.85 (4.75 - 4.96) times greater than the White British group. The proportion of individuals self-identifying as Muslim and Buddhist who had received a vaccine was 79.1% and 84.1%, respectively. Older age, greater area deprivation, less advantaged socio-economic position (proxied by living in a rented home), being disabled and living either alone or in a multi-generational household were also associated with higher odds of not having received the vaccine. <h4>Conclusion</h4> People disproportionately affected seem most hesitant to COVID-19 vaccinations. Policy Interventions to improve these disparities are urgently needed. <h4>Summary Box</h4> <h4>What is already known on this subject?</h4> The UK began an ambitious vaccination programme to combat the COVID-19 pandemic on 8th December 2020. Existing evidence suggests that COVID-19 vaccination rates differ by level of area deprivation, ethnicity and certain underlying health conditions, such as learning disability and mental health problems. <h4>What does this study add?</h4> Our study shows that first dose vaccination rates in adults aged 70 or over differed markedly by ethnic group and self-reported religious affiliation, even after adjusting for geography, socio-demographic factors and underlying health conditions. Our study also highlights differences in vaccination rates by deprivation, household composition, and disability status, factors disproportionately associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Public health policy and community engagement aimed at promoting vaccination uptake is these groups are urgently needed. <h4>Strengths and limitations of this study</h4> Using nationwide linked population-level data from clinical records and the 2011 Census, we examined a wide range of socio-demographic characteristics not available n electronic health records Most demographic and socio-economic characteristics are derived from the 2011 Census and therefore are 10 years old. However, we focus primarily on characteristics that are unlikely to change over time, such as ethnicity or religion, or likely to be stable for our population Because the data are based on the 2011 Census, it excluded people living in England in 2011 but not taking part in the 2011 Census; respondents who could not be linked to the 2011-2013 NHS patients register; recent migrants.

To characterise the systemic host immune response to SARS-CoV-2, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing coupled with analysis of cell surface proteins, providing molecular profiling of over 800,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a cohort of 130 patients with COVID-19. Our cohort, from three UK centres, spans the spectrum of clinical presentations and disease severities ranging from asymptomatic to critical.

Full single cell transcriptomes coupled with quantification of 188 cell surface proteins, and T and B lymphocyte antigen receptor repertoires have provided several insights into COVID-19: 1. a new non-classical monocyte state that sequesters platelets and replenishes the alveolar macrophage pool; 2. platelet activation accompanied by early priming towards megakaryopoiesis in immature haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and expansion of megakaryocyte-primed progenitors; 3. increased clonally expanded CD8 + effector:effector memory T cells, and proliferating CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in patients with more severe disease; and 4. relative increase of IgA plasmablasts in asymptomatic stages that switches to expansion of IgG plasmablasts and plasma cells, accompanied with higher incidence of BCR sharing, as disease severity increases.

As supply picks up, a key question becomes if vaccination remains an impactful and cost-effective strategy given changes in the timing of implementation. <h4>Methods</h4> We assessed the impact of timing using an epidemiological and economic model. We fitted our mathematical epidemiological model to reported COVID-19 deaths in 27 African countries to estimate the existing immunity (resulting from infection) before substantial vaccine rollout. We then projected health outcomes for different programme start dates (2021-01-01 to 2021-12-01, n = 12) and roll-out rates (slow, medium, fast; 275, 826, and 2066 doses/ million population-day, respectively) for viral vector and mRNA vaccines. Rollout rates used were derived from observed uptake trajectories. We collected data on vaccine delivery costs by country income group. Lastly, we calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and relative affordability. <h4>Findings</h4> Vaccination programmes with early start dates incur the most health benefits and are most cost-effective. While incurring the most health benefits, fast vaccine roll-outs are not always the most cost-effective. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 0.5xGDP per capita, vaccine programmes starting in August 2021 using mRNA and viral vector vaccines were cost-effective in 6-10 and 17-18 of 27 countries, respectively. <h4>Interpretation</h4> African countries with large proportions of their populations unvaccinated by late 2021 may find vaccination programmes less cost-effective than they could have been earlier in 2021.

This a complex question: COVID-19 may cause a cardiometabolic or respiratory event; admission for a clinical event may result in hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection; both may contribute to a patient surpassing the threshold for presenting to services; and the presence of a pandemic may change whether patients present to services at all. To inform analysis of these questions, we set out to describe the overall rate of various key clinical events over time, and their relationship with COVID-19. <h4>Methods</h4> Working on behalf of NHS England, we used data from the OpenSAFELY platform containing data from approximately 40% of the population of England. We selected the whole adult population of 17m patients and within this identified two further mutually exclusive groups: patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the community; and patients hospitalised with COVID-19. We report counts of death, DVT, PE, ischaemic stroke, MI, heart failure, AKI and diabetic ketoacidosis in each month between February 2019 and October 2020 within each of: the general population, community SARS-CoV-2 cases, and hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Outcome events were defined using hospitalisations, GP records and cause of death data. <h4>Results</h4> For all outcomes except death there was a lower count of events in April 2020 compared to April 2019. For most outcomes the minimum count of events was in April 2020, where the decrease compared to April 2019 in events ranged from 5.9% (PE) to 40.0% (heart failure). Despite hospitalised COVID-19 patients making up just 0.14% of the population in April 2020, these patients accounted for an extremely high proportion of cardiometabolic and respiratory events in that month (range of proportions 10.3% (DVT) to 33.5% (AKI)). <h4>Interpretation</h4> We observed a substantial drop in the incidence of cardiometabolic and pulmonary events in the non-COVID-19 general population, but high occurrence of COVID-19 among patients with these events. Shortcomings in routine NHS secondary care data, especially around the timing and order of events, make causal interpretations challenging. We caution that the intermediate findings reported here should be used to inform the design and interpretation of any studies using a general population comparator to evaluate the relationship between COVID-19 and other clinical events.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/02/19/2021.02.17.21251812.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.17.21251812; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR285619; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR285619&type=FILE&fileName=EMS117195-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures and efforts in response to the outbreak.     <br><br>Methods: We quantified the effects of control measures on population contact patterns in Wuhan, China, to assess their effects on the progression of the outbreak. We included the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model fitted to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in the age-structured epidemic framework. Further, we looked at the age-distribution of cases. Lastly, we simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way, and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak.     <br><br>Findings: Changes in mixing patterns may have contributed to reducing the number of infections in mid-2020 by 92% (interquartile range: 66–97%). There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of reducing the height of the peak, overall epidemic size in mid-2020 and probability that a second peak may occur after return to work.

We consider the utility of pre and post-flight Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and lateral flow testing (LFT) to reduce transmission risk from infected arrivals and to reduce the duration of, or replace, quarantine. We also estimate the effect of each strategy relative to domestic incidence, and limits of achievable risk reduction, for 99 countries where flight data and case numbers are estimated. <h4>Results</h4> We find that LFTs immediately pre-flight are more effective than PCR tests 3 days before departure in decreasing the number of departing infectious travellers. Pre-flight LFTs and post-flight quarantines, with tests to release, may prevent the majority of transmission from infectious arrivals while reducing the required duration of quarantine; a pre-flight LFT followed by 5 days in quarantine with a test to release would reduce the expected number of secondary cases generated by an infected traveller compared to symptomatic self-isolation alone, R s , by 85% (95% UI: 74%, 96%) for PCR and 85% (95% UI: 70%, 96%) for LFT, even assuming imperfect adherence to quarantine (28% of individuals) and self-isolation following a positive test (86%). Under the same adherence assumptions, 5 days of daily LFT testing would reduce R s by 91% (95% UI: 75%, 98%). <h4>Conclusions</h4> Strategies aimed at reducing the risk of imported cases should be considered with respect to: domestic incidence, transmission, and susceptibility; measures in place to support quarantining travellers; and incidence of new variants of concern in travellers’ origin countries. Daily testing with LFTs for 5 days is comparable to 5 days of quarantine with a test on exit or 14 days with no test.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/06/14/2021.06.11.21258735.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.11.21258735; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR356941; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR356941&type=FILE&fileName=EMS127927-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Various technologies, including laboratory assays and point-of-care self-tests, are available for antibody testing. The interpretation of seroprevalence studies requires comparative data on the performance of antibody tests. <h4>Methods</h4> In June 2020, current and former members of the UK Police forces and Fire service performed a self-test lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) and provided a saliva sample, nasopharyngeal swab, venous blood samples for Abbott ELISA and had a nurse performed LFIA. We present the prevalence of PCR positivity and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in this cohort following the first wave of infection in England; the acceptability and usability of self-test LFIAs (defined as use of the LFIA kit and provision of a valid result, respectively); and determine the sensitivity and specificity of LFIAs compared to laboratory ELISAs. <h4>Results</h4> In this cohort of non-healthcare key workers, 7.4% (396/5,348; 95% CI, 6.7-8.1) were antibody positive. Seroprevalence was 8.9% (6.9-11.4) in those under 40 years, 11.5% (8.8-15.0) in those of non-white British ethnicity and 7.8% (7.1-8.7) in those currently working. The self-test LFIA had an acceptability of 97.7% and a usability of 90.0%. There was substantial agreement between within-participant LFIA results (kappa 0.80; 0.77-0.83). The LFIAs (self-test and nurse-performed) had a similar performance: compared to ELISA, sensitivity was 82.1% (77.7-86.0) self-test and 76.4% (71.9-80.5) nurse-performed with specificity of 97.8% (97.3-98.2) and 98.5% (98.1-98.8) respectively. <h4>Conclusion</h4> A greater proportion of the non-healthcare key worker cohort showed evidence of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 than the general population at 6.0% (5.8-6.1) following the first wave in England. The high acceptability and usability reported by participants and the similar performance of self-test and nurse-performed LFIAs indicate that the self-test LFIA is fit for purpose for home-testing in occupational and community prevalence studies.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/06/27/2021.06.21.21259254.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.21.21259254; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR361566; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR361566&type=FILE&fileName=EMS128927-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Here we describe the reproducible harmonisation method developed using large-scale EHRs in Wales to accommodate the fast and efficient implementation of cross-nation analysis in England and Wales as part of the CVD-COVID-UK programme. We characterise current challenges and share lessons learnt. Methods  Serving the scope and scalability of multiple study protocols, we used linked, anonymised individual-level EHR, demographic and administrative data held within the SAIL Databank for the population of Wales. The harmonisation method was implemented as a four-layer reproducible process, starting from raw data in the first layer. Then each of the layers two to four is framed by, but not limited to, the characterised challenges and lessons learnt. We achieved curated data as part of our second layer, followed by extracting phenotyped data in the third layer. We captured any project-specific requirements in the fourth layer.

After adjustment (for age, sex, ethnicity, migration status, occupation, aerosol generating procedure exposure, work sector, work region, working hours, night shift frequency and trust in employing organisation), older HCWs (per decade increase in age: aOR 1.2, 95% CI 1.16-1.26, p<0.001) and those working in Intensive Care Units (1.61, 1.38 – 1.89, p<0.001) were more likely to report aPPE at all times. Those from Asian ethnic groups compared to White (0.77, 0.67-0.89, p<0.001), those in allied health professional (AHPs) and dental roles (vs those in medical roles; AHPs: 0.77, 0.68 – 0.87, p<0.001; dental: 0.63, 0.49-0.81, p<0.001), and those who saw a higher number of COVID-19 patients compared to those who saw none (≥21 patients 0.74, 0.61-0.90, p=0.003) were less likely to report aPPE at all times in the primary analysis. aPPE at all times was also not uniform across UK regions (reported access being better in South West and North East England than London). Those who trusted their employing organisation to deal with concerns about unsafe clinical practice, compared to those who did not, were twice as likely to report aPPE at all times (2.18, 1.97-2.40, p<0.001). With the exception of occupation, these factors were also significantly associated with aPPE at all times in the secondary analysis. <h4>Conclusions</h4> We found that only a third of HCWs in the UK reported aPPE at all times during the period of the first lockdown and that aPPE had improved later in the pandemic. We also identified key sociodemographic and occupational determinants of aPPE during the first UK lockdown, the majority of which have persisted since lockdown was eased. These findings have important public health implications for HCWs, particularly as cases of infection and long-COVID continue to rise in the UK. <h4>Trial registration</h4> ISRCTN 11811602 <h4>What is already known on this topic</h4> Access to personal protective equipment (PPE) is crucial to protect healthcare workers (HCWs) from infection. Limited data exist concerning the prevalence of, and factors relating to, PPE access for HCWs in the United Kingdom (UK) during the COVID-19 pandemic. <h4>What this study adds</h4> Only a third of HCWs reported having access to appropriate PPE all of the time during the first UK national lockdown. Older HCWs, those working in Intensive Care Units and those who trusted their employing organisation to deal with concerns about unsafe clinical practice, were more likely to report access to adequate PPE. Those from Asian ethnic groups (compared to White ethnic groups) and those who saw a high number of COVID-19 were less likely to report access to adequate PPE.

We estimate the risk of critical care admission, mortality in critical ill patients, and overall mortality associated with VOC B.1.1.7 compared with the original variant. We also compare clinical outcomes between these variants ‘ groups. <h4>Methods</h4> We linked a large primary care (QResearch), the national critical care (ICNARC CMP) and the COVID-19 testing (PHE) database and extracted two cohorts. The first was used to explore the association between VOC B.1.1.7 and critical care admission and 28-day mortality. The second to determine the risk of mortality in critically ill patients with VOC B.1.1.7 compared to those without. We used Royston-Parmar models adjusted for age, sex, region, other socio-demographics and comorbidities (asthma, COPD, type I and II, hypertension). We reported information on types and duration of organ supports for the two variants ‘ groups. <h4>Findings</h4> The first cohort included 198,420 patients. Of these, 80,494 had VOC B.1.1.7, 712 were critically ill and 630 died by 28 days. The second cohort included 3432 critically ill patients. Of these, 2019 had VOC B.1.1.7 and 822 died at the end of critical care. Using the first cohort, we estimated adjusted hazard ratios for critical care admission and mortality to be 1.99 (95% CI: 1.59, 2.49) and 1.59 (95% CI: 1.25-2.03) for VOC B.1.1.7 compared with the original variant group, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio for mortality in critical care, estimated using the second cohort, was 0.93 (95% CI 0.76-1.15) for patients with VOC B.1.1.7, compared to those without. <h4>Interpretation</h4> VOC B.1.1.7 appears to be more severe. Patients with VOC B.1.1.7 are at increased risk of critical care admission and mortality compared with patients without. For patients receiving critical care, mortality appears independent of virus strain. <h4>RESEARCH IN CONTEXT</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> A new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, variant of concern (VOC) 202012/01, or lineage B.1.1.7, was detected in England in September 2020. The characteristics and outcomes of patients infected with VOC B.1.1.7 are not yet known. VOC B.1.1.7 has been associated with increased transmissibility. Early analyses have suggested infection with VOC B.1.1.7 may be associated with a higher risk of mortality compared with infection with other virus variants, but these analyses had either limited ability to adjust for key confounding variables or did not consider critical care admission. The effects of VOC B.1.1.7 on severe COVID-19 outcomes remain unclear. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> This study found a 60% higher risk of 28-day mortality associated with infection with VOC B.1.1.7 in patients tested in the community in comparison with the original variant, when adjusted for key confounding variables. The risk of critical care admission for those with VOC B.1.1.7 is double the risk associated with the original variant. For patients receiving critical care, the infecting variant is not associated with the risk of mortality at the end of critical care. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> The higher mortality and rate of critical care admission associated with VOC B.1.1.7, combined with its known increased transmissibility, are likely to put health care systems under further stress. These effects may be mitigated by the ongoing vaccination programme.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/03/12/2021.03.11.21253364.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.11.21253364; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR296449; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR296449&type=FILE&fileName=EMS119297-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

What is unclear is whether the characteristics affecting vulnerability of small communities within countries produce similar patterns of excess mortality across countries with different demographics and public health responses to the pandemic. Our aim is to quantify community-level variations in excess mortality within England, Italy and Sweden and identify how such spatial variability was driven by community-level characteristics. <h4>Methods</h4> We applied a two-stage Bayesian model to quantify inequalities in excess mortality in people aged 40 years and older at the community level in England, Italy and Sweden during the first year of the pandemic (March 2020–February 2021). We used community characteristics measuring deprivation, air pollution, living conditions, population density and movement of people as covariates to quantify their associations with excess mortality. <h4>Results</h4> We found just under half of communities in England (48.1%) and Italy (45.8%) had an excess mortality of over 300 per 100,000 males over the age of 40, while for Sweden that covered 23.1% of communities. We showed that deprivation is a strong predictor of excess mortality across the three countries, and communities with high levels of overcrowding were associated with higher excess mortality in England and Sweden. <h4>Conclusion</h4> These results highlight some international similarities in factors affecting mortality that will help policy makers target public health measures to increase resilience to the mortality impacts of this and future pandemics.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/05/09/2022.04.26.22274332.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.26.22274332; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR486740; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR486740&type=FILE&fileName=EMS144662-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We set out to evaluate the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for prevention, as opposed to treatment, of COVID-19 mortality. <h4>Methods</h4> We pre-specified and conducted an observational, population-based cohort study using national primary care data and linked death registrations in the OpenSAFELY platform, representing 40% of the general population in England. We used Cox regression to estimate the association between ongoing routine hydroxychloroquine use prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in England and risk of COVID-19 mortality among people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Model adjustment was informed by a directed acyclic graph. <h4>Results</h4> Of 194,637 patients with RA or SLE, 30,569 (15.7%) received ≥ 2 prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine in the six months prior to 1 March 2020. Between 1 March 2020 and 13 July 2020, there were 547 COVID-19 deaths, 70 among hydroxychloroquine users. Estimated standardised cumulative COVID-19 mortality was 0.23% (95% CI 0.18–0.29) among users and 0.22% (95% CI 0.20–0.25) among non-users; an absolute difference of 0.008% (95% CI –0.051-0.066). After accounting for age, sex, ethnicity, use of other immunuosuppressives, and geographic region, no association with COVID-19 mortality was observed (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.80–1.33). We found no evidence of interactions with age or other immunosuppressives. Quantitative bias analyses indicated observed associations were robust to missing information regarding additional biologic treatments for rheumatological disease. We observed similar associations with the negative control outcome of non-COVID-19 mortality. <h4>Conclusion</h4> We found no evidence of a difference in COVID-19 mortality among patients who received hydroxychloroquine for treatment of rheumatological disease prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in England. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> Published trials and observational studies to date have shown no evidence of benefit of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for hospitalised patients who already have COVID-19. A separate question remains: whether routine ongoing use of hydroxychloroquine in people without COVID-19 protects against new infections or severe outcomes. We searched MEDLINE/PubMed for pharmacoepidemiological studies evaluating hydroxychloroquine for prevention of severe COVID-19 outcomes. The keywords “hydroxychloroquine AND (COVID OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (prophyl* OR prevent*) AND (rate OR hazard OR odds OR risk)” were used and results were filtered to articles from the last year with abstracts available. 109 papers were identified for screening; none investigated pre-exposure prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine for prevention of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Clinical trials of prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine are ongoing; however, the largest trial does not expect to meet recruitment targets due to “…unjustified extrapolation and exaggerated safety concerns together with intense politicisation and negative publicity.” In the absence of reported clinical trials, evidence can be generated from real-world data to support the need for randomised clinical trials. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> In this cohort study representing 40% of the population of England, we investigated whether routine use of hydroxychloroquine prior to the COVID-19 outbreak prevented COVID-19 mortality. Using robust pharmacoepidemiological methods, we found no evidence to support a substantial benefit of hydroxychloroquine in preventing COVID-19 mortality. At the same time, we have shown no significant harm, and this generates the equipoise to justify continuing randomised trials. We have demonstrated in this study that it is feasible to address specific hypotheses about medicines in a rapid and transparent manner to inform interim clinical decision making and support the need for large-scale, randomised trial data. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> This is the first study to investigate the ongoing routine use of hydroxychloroquine and risk of COVID-19 mortality in a general population. While we found no evidence of any protective benefit, due to the observational nature of the study, residual confounding remains a possibility. Completion of trials for prevention of severe outcomes is warranted, but prior to the completion of these, we found no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine for prevention of COVID-19 mortality.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/09/09/2020.09.04.20187781.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.04.20187781; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR211707; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR211707&type=FILE&fileName=EMS94873-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We categorised responses to a free-text question “What should society do if people don’t get vaccinated against COVID-19?” using content analysis. We collapsed categories into a binary variable: favours mandatory vaccination or not and used logistic regression to calculate its demographic predictors, and occupational, health and attitudinal predictors adjusted for demographics. <h4>Findings</h4> Of 5633 questionnaire respondents, 3235 answered the freetext question; 18% (n=578) of those favoured mandatory vaccination but the most frequent suggestion was education (32%, n=1047).

The availability of pre-infection imaging data reduces the likelihood of pre-existing risk factors being misinterpreted as disease effects. We identified significant longitudinal effects when comparing the two groups, including: (i) greater reduction in grey matter thickness and tissue-contrast in the orbitofrontal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus, (ii) greater changes in markers of tissue damage in regions functionally-connected to the primary olfactory cortex, and (iii) greater reduction in global brain size.

However, empirical evidence of the effectiveness of specific NPIs has been inconsistent. We assessed the effectiveness of NPIs around internal containment and closure, international travel restrictions, economic measures, and health system actions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 130 countries and territories. <h4>Methods</h4> We used panel (longitudinal) regression to estimate the effectiveness of 13 categories of NPIs in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission with data from January - June 2020. First, we examined the temporal association between NPIs using hierarchical cluster analyses. We then regressed the time-varying reproduction number ( R t ) of COVID-19 against different NPIs. We examined different model specifications to account for the temporal lag between NPIs and changes in R t , levels of NPI intensity, time-varying changes in NPI effect and variable selection criteria. Results were interpreted taking into account both the range of model specifications and temporal clustering of NPIs. <h4>Results</h4> There was strong evidence for an association between two NPIs (school closure, internal movement restrictions) and reduced R t . Another three NPIs (workplace closure, income support and debt/contract relief) had strong evidence of effectiveness when ignoring their level of intensity, while two NPIs (public events cancellation, restriction on gatherings) had strong evidence of their effectiveness only when evaluating their implementation at maximum capacity (e.g., restrictions on 1000+ people gathering were not effective, restrictions on <10 people gathering was). Evidence supporting the effectiveness of the remaining NPIs (stay-at-home requirements, public information campaigns, public transport closure, international travel controls, testing, contact tracing) was inconsistent and inconclusive. We found temporal clustering between many of the NPIs. <h4>Conclusion</h4> Understanding the impact that specific NPIs have had on SARS-CoV-2 transmission is complicated by temporal clustering, time-dependent variation in effects and differences in NPI intensity. However, the effectiveness of school closure and internal movement restrictions appears robust across different model specifications taking into account these effects, with some evidence that other NPIs may also be effective under particular conditions. This provides empirical evidence for the potential effectiveness of many although not all the actions policy-makers are taking to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/08/12/2020.08.11.20172643.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.11.20172643; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR199535; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR199535&type=FILE&fileName=EMS92611-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We  estimated the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection for staff  and pupils over the period August - December 2020, dependent on measures of  recent exposure to known cases linked to their educational  settings. <h4>Results</h4>  The total number of cases in a school was not associated with a  subsequent increase in the risk of testing positive (Staff OR per case 0.92,  95%CI 0.85, 1.00; Pupils OR per case 0.98, 95%CI 0.93, 1.02).

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection than the general population but risk factors for HCW infection are not well described. <h4>Methods</h4> We conducted a prospective sero-epidemiological study of HCWs at a UK teaching hospital using a SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay. Risk factors for seropositivity were analysed using multivariate logistic regression. <h4>Findings</h4> 410/5,698 (7·2%) staff tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Seroprevalence was higher in those working in designated COVID-19 areas compared with other areas (9·47% versus 6·16%) Healthcare assistants (aOR 2·06 [95%CI 1·14-3·71]; p =0·016) and domestic and portering staff (aOR 3·45 [95% CI 1·07-11·42]; p =0·039) had significantly higher seroprevalence than other staff groups after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity and COVID-19 working location. Staff working in acute medicine and medical sub-specialities were also at higher risk (aOR 2·07 [95% CI 1·31-3·25]; p <0·002). Staff from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds had an aOR of 1·65 (95% CI 1·32 – 2·07; p <0·001) compared to white staff; this increased risk was independent of COVID-19 area working. The only symptoms significantly associated with seropositivity in a multivariable model were loss of sense of taste or smell, fever and myalgia; 31% of staff testing positive reported no prior symptoms. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst HCWs is heterogeneous and influenced by COVID-19 working location, role, age and ethnicity. Increased risk amongst BAME staff cannot be accounted for solely by occupational factors. <h4>Funding</h4> Wellcome Trust, Addenbrookes Charitable Trust, National Institute for Health Research, Academy of Medical Sciences, the Health Foundation and the NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> Specific risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) are not well defined. Additionally, it is not clear how population level risk factors influence occupational risk in defined demographic groups. Only by identifying these factors can we mitigate and reduce the risk of occupational SARS-CoV-2 infection. We performed a review of the evidence for HCW-specific risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We searched PubMed with the terms “SARS-CoV-2” OR “COVID-19” AND “Healthcare worker” OR “Healthcare Personnel” AND “Risk factor” to identify any studies published in any language between December 2019 and September 2020. The search identified 266 studies and included a meta-analysis and two observational studies assessing HCW cohort seroprevalence data. Seroprevalence and risk factors for HCW infections varied between studies, with contradictory findings. In the two serological studies, one identified a significant increased risk of seroprevalence in those working with COVID-19 patients (Eyre et al 2020), as well as associations with job role and department. The other study (Dimcheff et al 2020) found no significant association between seropositivity and any identified demographic or occupational factor. A meta-analysis of HCW (Gomez-Ochoa et al 2020) assessed >230,000 participants as a pooled analysis, including diagnoses by both RT-PCR and seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and found great heterogeneity in study design and reported contradictory findings. Of note, they report a seropositivity rate of 7% across all studies reporting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCWs. Nurses were the most frequently affected healthcare personnel and staff working in non-emergency inpatient settings were the most frequently affected group. Our search found no prospective studies systematically evaluating HCW specific risk factors based entirely on seroprevalence data. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> Our prospective cohort study of almost 6,000 HCWs at a large UK teaching hospital strengthens previous findings from UK-based cohorts in identifying an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure amongst HCWs. Specifically, factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 exposure include caring for confirmed COVID-19 cases and identifying as being within specific ethnic groups (BAME staff). We further delineated the risk amongst BAME staff and demonstrate that occupational factors alone do not account for all of the increased risk amongst this group. We demonstrate for the first time that healthcare assistants represent a key at-risk occupational group, and challenge previous findings of significantly higher risk amongst nursing staff. Seroprevalence in staff not working in areas with confirmed COVID-19 patients was only marginally higher than that of the general population within the same geographical region. This observation could suggest the increased risk amongst HCWs arises through occupational exposure to confirmed cases and could account for the overall higher seroprevalence in HCWs, rather than purely the presence of staff in healthcare facilities. Over 30% of seropositive staff had not reported symptoms consistent with COVID-19, and in those who did report symptoms, differentiating COVID-19 from other causes based on symptom data alone was unreliable. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> International efforts to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst HCWs need to be prioritised. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst HCWs is heterogenous but also follows demonstrable patterns. Potential mechanisms to reduce the risk for staff working in areas with confirmed COVID-19 patients include improved training in hand hygiene and personal protective equipment (PPE), better access to high quality PPE, and frequent asymptomatic testing. Wider asymptomatic testing in healthcare facilities has the potential to reduce spread of SARS-CoV-2 within hospitals, thereby reducing patient and staff risk and limiting spread between hospitals and into the wider community. The increased risk of COVID-19 amongst BAME staff cannot be explained by purely occupational factors; however, the increased risk amongst minority ethnic groups identified here was stark and necessitates further evaluation.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/11/04/2020.11.03.20220699.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.03.20220699; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR233926; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR233926&type=FILE&fileName=EMS103610-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

However, given that people were restricted to their homes and immediate neighbourhoods, there were stark inequalities in how different people experienced lockdown. Nevertheless, evidence on the associations of home and neighbourhood conditions in mental health during lockdown is sparce. <h4>Methods</h4>  Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a UK population-based cohort, we examined associations of home and neighbourhood conditions with anxiety and depression symptoms at two points during the first UK lockdown in 2020 (23/03/20-15/06/20). Questionnaires were sent to the ALSPAC cohort at two timepoints (T1: April; T2: May/June), including validated measures of mental health, and questions about current home conditions and behaviours, including access to nature, garden access, house type, and household composition. Neighbourhood conditions were obtained via a novel linkage, and included neighbourhood deprivation, population density, social fragmentation, and greenspace. Main associations were examined using linear regression. Potential confounders were identified using a directed acyclic graph and included ethnicity, family psychiatric history, maternal social class, financial difficulties before lockdown, and previous anxiety and depression at age 18. <h4>Findings</h4>  At T1, reduced access to nature (B=1.06, 95% CI=0.68-1.45, p<0.001) and neighbourhood deprivation (B=0.25, 95% CI=0.02-0.48) were associated with anxiety. Furthermore, reduced access to nature (B=0.99, 95% CI=0.57-1.40, p<0.001), no garden access (B=0.62, 95% CI=0.04-1.20, p=0.037), living alone (B=1.53, 95% CI=0.63-2.43, p=0.001), and neighbourhood deprivation (B=0.27, 95% CI=0.02-0.52, p=0.033) were associated with depression. Associations were similar, but often weaker, at T2. For example, there was strong evidence of associations only for access nature with anxiety (B=0.74, 95% CI=0.25-1.23, p=0.004); and for access to nature (B=1.06, 95% CI=0.50-1.61, p=0.001) and living alone (B=1.19, 95% CI=0.25-2.13, p=0.013) with depression. <h4>Interpretation</h4>  Disadvantaged home and neighbourhood conditions, especially reduced access to nature and neighbourhood deprivation, were associated with more anxiety and depression symptoms during the first UK lockdown. In the case of future pandemics, mitigation efforts should be tailored to reduce the burden on mental health for those most vulnerable. However, the causality of these observational findings is uncertain.",,doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.23.24310858; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.23.24310858; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR886269; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR886269&type=FILE&fileName=EMS197792-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Alternatively, close contact with children may increase risk of SARs-CoV-2 infection. We investigated whether risk of infection with SARs-CoV-2 and severe outcomes differed between adults living with and without children. <h4>Methods</h4> Working on behalf of NHS England, we conducted a population-based cohort study using primary care data and pseudonymously-linked hospital and intensive care admissions, and death records, from patients registered in general practices representing 40% of England. Using multivariable Cox regression, we calculated fully-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of outcomes from 1st February-3rd August 2020 comparing adults living with and without children in the household. <h4>Findings</h4> Among 9,157,814 adults ≤65 years, living with children 0-11 years was not associated with increased risks of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 related hospital or ICU admission but was associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 death (HR 0.75, 95%CI 0.62-0.92). Living with children aged 12-18 years was associated with a small increased risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection (HR 1.08, 95%CI 1.03-1.13), but not associated with other COVID-19 outcomes. Living with children of any age was also associated with lower risk of dying from non-COVID-19 causes. Among 2,567,671 adults >65 years there was no association between living with children and outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2. We observed no consistent changes in risk following school closure. <h4>Interpretation</h4> For adults living with children there is no evidence of an increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. These findings have implications for determining the benefit-harm balance of children attending school in the COVID-19 pandemic. <h4>Funding</h4> This work was supported by the Medical Research Council MR/V015737/1. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We searched MEDLINE on 19th October 2020 for population-based epidemiological studies comparing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease in people living with and without children. We searched for articles published in 2020, with abstracts available, and terms “(children or parents or dependants) AND (COVID or SARS-CoV-2 or coronavirus) AND (rate or hazard or odds or risk), in the title, abstract or keywords. 244 papers were identified for screening but none were relevant. One additional study in preprint was identified on medRxiv and found a reduced risk of hospitalisation for COVID-19 and a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection among adult healthcare workers living with children. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> This is the first population-based study to investigate whether the risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes from COVID-19 differ between adults living in households with and without school-aged children during the UK pandemic. Our findings show that for adults living with children there is no evidence of an increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes although there may be a slightly increased risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection for working-age adults living with children aged 12 to 18 years. Working-age adults living with children 0 to 11 years have a lower risk of death from COVID-19 compared to adults living without children, with the effect size being comparable to their lower risk of death from any cause. We observed no consistent changes in risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes from COVID-19 comparing periods before and after school closure. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Our results demonstrate no evidence of serious harms from COVID-19 to adults in close contact with children, compared to those living in households without children. This has implications for determining the benefit-harm balance of children attending school in the COVID-19 pandemic.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/11/02/2020.11.01.20222315.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.01.20222315; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR233548; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR233548&type=FILE&fileName=EMS103455-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

This study seeks to address a deficit in the literature concerning the effect of long waits on the wider consumption of healthcare resources. <h4>Methods</h4> We carried out a retrospective treatment-control study in a healthcare system in South West England from 15 June 2021 to 15 December 2021. We compared weekly contacts with health services of patients waiting over 18 weeks for treatment (‘Treatments’) and people not on a waiting list (‘Controls’). Controls were matched to Treatments based on age, sex, deprivation and multimorbidity. Treatments were stratified by the clinical specialty of the awaited treatment, with healthcare usage assessed over various healthcare settings. T-tests assessed whether there was an increase in healthcare utilisation and bootstrap resampling was used to estimate the magnitude of any differences. <h4>Results</h4> A total of 44,616 patients were waiting over 18 weeks (the constitutional target in England) for treatment during the study period. Evidence suggests increases (p < 0.05) in healthcare utilisation for all specialties. Patients in the Cardiothoracic Surgery specialty had the largest increase, requiring 17.9 [4.3, 33.8] additional contacts with secondary care and 17.3 [-1.1, 34.1] additional prescriptions per year. <h4>Conclusion</h4> People waiting for treatment consume higher levels of healthcare than comparable individuals not on a waiting list. These findings are relevant for clinicians and managers in better understanding patient need and reducing harm. Results also highlight the possible ‘false economy’ in failing to promptly resolve long elective waits. <h4>Highlights</h4> Long waits for elective care can result in additional healthcare needs to manage symptoms up to the point of definitive treatment. While previous studies indicate some association, these mainly consider only a single elective specialty and are limited in the range of healthcare settings covered. The large number of long-wait pathways produced as a consequence of COVID-19 disruption allows for a more holistic analysis, covering the full range of elective treatment specialties and wider healthcare impacts across primary, secondary, mental health, and community care, as well as emergency service calls and prescriptions. Analysis of 44,616 elective care pathways reveals evidence of increases in wider healthcare consumption additional to that expected for similar patients not awaiting elective treatment. This suggests a ‘false economy’ in failing to promptly resolve elective pathways, which should be reflected by healthcare providers in long-term resource allocation decisions.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/07/27/2023.07.25.23293143.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.25.23293143; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR698319; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR698319&type=FILE&fileName=EMS182115-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. <h4>Methods</h4> In this randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]) several possible treatments are being compared with usual care in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated to receive either usual care plus high titre convalescent plasma or usual care alone. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. <h4>Findings</h4> Between 28 May 2020 and 15 January 2021, 5795 patients were randomly allocated to receive convalescent plasma and 5763 to usual care alone. There was no significant difference in 28-day mortality between the two groups: 1398 (24%) of 5795 patients allocated convalescent plasma and 1408 (24%) of 5763 patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio [RR] 1·00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0·93 to 1·07; p=0·93).

Many treatments were postponed or cancelled, although the impact was mitigated by new models of delivery. While the scale of disruption has been studied, much less is known about if this disruption impacted health outcomes. The aim of our paper is to examine whether there is an association between individuals experiencing disrupted access to healthcare during the pandemic and risk of an avoidable hospitalisation. <h4>Methods</h4> We used individual-level data for England from seven longitudinal cohort studies linked to electronic health records from NHS Digital (n = 29 276) within the UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration trusted research environment. Avoidable hospitalisations were defined as emergency hospital admissions for ambulatory care sensitive and emergency urgent care sensitive conditions (1 st March 2020 to 25 th August 2022). Self-reported measures of whether people had experienced disruption during the pandemic to appointments (e.g., visiting their GP or an outpatient department), procedures (e.g., surgery, cancer treatment) or medications were used as our exposures. Logistic regression models examined associations. <h4>Results</h4> 35% of people experienced some form of disrupted access to healthcare. Those whose access was disrupted were at increased risk of any (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.80, 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) = 1.34-2.41), acute (OR = 1.68, CIs = 1.13-2.53) and chronic (OR = 1.93, CIs = 1.40-2.64) ambulatory care sensitive hospital admissions. There were positive associations between disrupted access to appointments and procedures to measures of avoidable hospitalisations as well. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Our study presents novel evidence from linked individual-level data showing that people whose access to healthcare was disrupted were more likely to have an avoidable or potentially preventable hospitalisation.

The remainder, 31%, indicated that they would not have the vaccine during pregnancy (n = 94). Reasons for having the vaccine related to protecting self and baby, perceived risk level, and receipt of sufficient evidence and advice. Reasons for vaccine refusal included lack of research about long-term outcomes for the baby, anxiety about vaccines, inconsistent advice/information, and preference to wait until after the pregnancy. <h4>Conclusion</h4> Potentially only 1 in 3 pregnant women would have the COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy, even though 2 in 3 reported they would have the vaccination, thus it is critical to develop tailored strategies to increase its acceptance rate and to decrease vaccine hesitancy.

Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures and efforts in response to the outbreak. <h4>METHODS</h4> We quantified the effects of control measures on population contact patterns in Wuhan, China, to assess their effects on the progression of the outbreak. We included the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model fitted to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in the age-structured epidemic framework. Further, we looked at the age-distribution of cases. Lastly, we simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way, and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak. <h4>FINDINGS</h4> Changes in mixing patterns may have contributed to reducing the number of infections in mid-2020 by 92% (interquartile range: 66–97%). There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of reducing the height of the peak, overall epidemic size in mid-2020 and probability that a second peak may occur after return to work. However, the modelled effects of social distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children play in the epidemic. <h4>INTERPRETATION</h4> Restrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would likely contribute to the reduction and delay the epidemic size and peak, respectively.

Strategies for safe operation of schools during pandemics therefore need to carefully consider both the efficiency of measures for infection control and the impact on children through lost face-to face schooling time. Heterogeneous social contact patterns associated with the social structures of schools (i.e. classes/grades) are likely to influence the within-school transmission dynamics; however, empirical evidence on the fine-scale transmission patterns between students has been limited. Using a mathematical model, we analysed a large-scale dataset of seasonal influenza outbreaks in Matsumoto city, Japan to infer social interactions within and between classes/grades from observed transmission patterns. The overall within-school reproduction number, which determines the initial growth of cases and the risk of sustained transmission, was only minimally associated with class sizes and the number of classes per grade. We then used these patterns in a model parameterised separately to COVID-19 and pandemic influenza, and simulated school outbreaks under multiple strategies for minimising the risk of within-school transmission. Simulations suggested that with such transmission patterns, interventions changing class structures (e.g. reduced class sizes) may not be effective in reducing the risk of major school outbreaks upon introduction of a case and that other precautionary measures (e.g. screening and isolation) need to be employed. Class-level closures in response to detection of a case were suggested to be effective in reducing the size of an outbreak when regular screening tests for students are not available.</p>",,pdf:https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-322366/v1.pdf?c=1631894367000; doi:https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-322366/v1; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR318575; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR318575&type=FILE&fileName=EMS123500-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

One of them is the contribution to transmission from individuals experiencing asymptomatic infections. We aimed to characterise the proportion and infectiousness of asymptomatic infections using data from the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. <h4>Methods</h4> We used a transmission model of COVID-19 with asymptomatic and presymptomatic states calibrated to outbreak data from the Diamond Princess, to quantify the contribution of asymptomatic infections to transmission. Data available included the date of symptom onset for symptomatic disease for passengers and crew, the number of symptom agnostic tests done each day, and date of positive test for asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals. <h4>Findings</h4> On the Diamond Princess 74% (70-78%) of infections proceeded asymptomatically, i.e. a 1:3.8 case-to-infection ratio. Despite the intense testing 53%, (51-56%) of infections remained undetected, most of them asymptomatic. Asymptomatic individuals were the source for 69% (20-85%) of all infections. While the data did not allow identification of the infectiousness of asymptomatic infections, assuming no or low infectiousness resulted in posterior estimates for the net reproduction number of an individual progressing through presymptomatic and symptomatic stages in excess of 15. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections may contribute substantially to transmission.

Many methods exist that allow the estimation of R t from case data. However, these are not easily adapted to point prevalence data nor can they infer R t across periods of missing data. We developed a Bayesian P-spline model suitable for fitting to a wide range of epidemic time-series, including point-prevalence data. We demonstrate the utility of the model by fitting to periodic daily SARS-CoV-2 swab-positivity data in England from the first 7 rounds (May 2020 – December 2020) of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study. Estimates of R t over the period of two subsequent rounds (6-8 weeks) and single rounds (2-3 weeks) inferred using the Bayesian P-spline model were broadly consistent with estimates from a simple exponential model, with overlapping credible intervals. However, there were sometimes substantial differences in point estimates. The Bayesian P-spline model was further able to infer changes in R t over shorter periods tracking a temporary increase above one during late-May 2020, a gradual increase in R t over the summer of 2020 as restrictions were eased, and a reduction in R t during England’ s second national lockdown followed by an increase as the Alpha variant surged. The model is robust against both under-fitting and over-fitting and is able to interpolate between periods of available data; it is a particularly versatile model when growth rate can change over small timescales, as in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Identification of genetic variants that influence the level or activity of these proteins in the host could enable rapid ‘in silico’ assessment in human genetic studies of their causal relevance as molecular targets for new or repurposed drugs to treat COVID-19. We integrated large-scale genomic and aptamer-based plasma proteomic data from 10,708 individuals to characterize the genetic architecture of 179 host proteins reported to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins or to participate in the host response to COVID-19. We identified 220 host DNA sequence variants acting in cis (MAF 0.01-49.9%) and explaining 0.3-70.9% of the variance of 97 of these proteins, including 45 with no previously known protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) and 38 encoding current drug targets. Systematic characterization of pQTLs across the phenome identified protein-drug-disease links, evidence that putative viral interaction partners such as MARK3 affect immune response, and establish the first link between a recently reported variant for respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients at the ABO locus and hypercoagulation, i.e. maladaptive host response.

We quantified the impact of less than perfect diagnostic test accuracy on populations, and on individuals, in low prevalence settings, focusing on false positives and the role of confirmatory testing. <h4>Methods</h4> We developed a simple, interactive tool to assess the impact of different combinations of test sensitivity, specificity and infection prevalence in a notional population of 100,000. We derived numbers of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives, positive predictive value (PPV – the percentage of test positives that are true positives) and overall test accuracy for three testing strategies: (1) single test for all; (2) add repeat testing in test positives; (3) add further repeat testing in those with discrepant results. We also assessed the impact on test results for individuals having one, two or three tests under these three strategies. <h4>Results</h4> With sensitivity of 80%, infection prevalence of 1 in 2,000, and specificity 99.9% on all tests, PPV in the tested population of 100,000 will be only 29% with one test, increasing to > 99.5% (100% when rounded to the nearest %) with repeat testing in strategies 2 or 3. More realistically, if specificity is 95% for the first and 99.9% for subsequent tests, single test PPV will be only 1%, increasing to 86% with repeat testing in strategy 2, or 79% with strategy 3 (albeit with 6 fewer false negatives than strategy 2). In the whole population, or in particular individuals, PPV increases as infection becomes more common in the population but falls to unacceptably low levels with lower test specificity. <h4>Conclusion</h4> To avoid multiple unnecessary restrictions on whole populations, and in particular individuals, from widespread population testing for SARS-CoV-2, the crucial roles of extremely high test specificity and of confirmatory testing must be fully appreciated and incorporated into policy decisions.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/08/22/2020.08.19.20178137.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.19.20178137; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR204608; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR204608&type=FILE&fileName=EMS95538-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Our dataset consisted of 2,613,341 individual-level daily observations within 697 care homes. <h4>Methods</h4> We estimated odds ratios (ORs [95% confidence interval]) using multilevel logistic regression models.

We included time dependent covariates for the estimated community positive test rate of COVID-19, hospital admissions, and vaccination status. Additional covariates were included for age, positive PCR tests prior to the study, sex, frailty (using the hospital frailty risk score), and specialist care home services. <h4>Results</h4> The multivariable logistic regression model indicated an increase in age (OR 1.01 [1.00,1.01] per year of age), community positive test rate (OR 1.13 [1.12,1.13] per percent increase in positive test rate), hospital inpatients (OR 7.40 [6.54,8.36]), and residents in care homes with non-specialist dementia care (OR 1.42 [1.01,1.99]) had an increased odds of a positive test.

This study aimed to 1) estimate COVID-19 vaccination rates among pregnant women in Wales and their association with age, ethnicity, and area of deprivation, using electronic health records (EHR) linkage, and 2) explore pregnant women’s views on receiving the COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy using data from a survey recruiting via social media (Facebook, Twitter), through midwives, and posters in hospitals (Born in Wales Cohort). Methods  This was a mixed-methods study utilising routinely collected linked data from the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) (Objective 1) and the Born-In-Wales Birth Cohort participants (Objective 2). Survival analysis was utilised to examine and compare the length of time to vaccination uptake in pregnancy, and variation in uptake by; age, ethnicity, and deprivation area was examined using hazard ratios (HR) from Cox regression. Codebook thematic analysis was used to generate themes from an open-ended question on the survey. Results  <bold>Population-level data linkage (objective 1)</bold>: Within the population cohort, 32.7% (n = 8,203) were vaccinated (at least one dose of the vaccine) during pregnancy, 34.1% (n = 8,572) remained unvaccinated throughout follow-up period, and 33.2% (n = 8,336) received the vaccine postpartum. Younger women (< 30 years) were less likely to have the vaccine and those living in areas of high deprivation were also less likely to have the vaccine (HR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.95). Asian and other ethnic groups were 1.12 and 1.18 times more likely to have the vaccine in pregnancy compared to women of White ethnicity (HR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.25) and (HR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.37) respectively. <bold>Survey responses (objective 2)</bold>: 69% of participants stated that they would be happy to have the vaccine during pregnancy (n = 207). The remainder, 31%, indicated that they would not have the vaccine during pregnancy (n = 94). Reasons for having the vaccine included protecting self and baby, perceived risk level, and receipt of sufficient evidence and advice. Reasons for vaccine refusal included lack of research about long-term outcomes for the baby, anxiety about vaccines, inconsistent advice/information, and preference to wait until after the pregnancy. Conclusion  Potentially only 1 in 3 pregnant women would have the COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy, even though 2 in 3 reported they would have the vaccination, thus it is critical to develop tailored strategies to increase its acceptance rate and to decrease vaccine hesitancy. A targeted approach to vaccinations may be required for groups such as younger people and those living in higher deprivation level areas.</p>",,pdf:https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1831644/latest.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1831644/v1; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR520994; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR520994&type=FILE&fileName=EMS151343-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Introducing a new sample preparation pipeline coupled with short-gradient high-flow liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, our methodology facilitates clinical implementation and increases sample throughput and quantification precision.

We evaluated the association between ICS and COVID-19 related death using linked electronic health records in the UK. <h4>Methods</h4> We conducted cohort studies on two groups of people (COPD and asthma) using the OpenSAFELY platform to analyse data from primary care practices linked to national death registrations. People receiving an ICS were compared to those receiving alternative respiratory medications. Our primary outcome was COVID-19 related death. <h4>Findings</h4> We identified 148,588 people with COPD and 817,973 people with asthma receiving relevant respiratory medications in the four months prior to 01 March 2020. People with COPD receiving ICS were at a greater risk of COVID-19 related death compared to those receiving a long-acting beta agonist (LABA) and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) (adjusted HR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.08 – 1.75). People with asthma receiving high dose ICS were at an increased risk of death compared to those receiving a short-acting beta agonist (SABA) only (adjusted HR = 1.52, 95%CI = 1.08 – 2.14); the adjusted HR for those receiving low-medium dose ICS was 1.10 (95% CI = 0.82 – 1.49). Quantitative bias analyses indicated that an unmeasured confounder of only moderate strength of association with exposure and outcome could explain the observed associations in both populations. <h4>Interpretation</h4> These results do not support a major role of ICS in protecting against COVID-19 related deaths.

Admissions and procedures during the pandemic (2020-2021) related to six major cardiovascular conditions (acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, stroke/transient ischaemic attack, peripheral arterial disease, aortic aneurysm, and venous thromboembolism) were compared to the annual average in the pre-pandemic period (2016-2019). Differences were assessed by time period and urgency of care. <h4>Results</h4> In 2020, there were 31,064 (−6%) fewer hospital admissions (14,506 [-4%] fewer emergencies, 16,560 [-23%] fewer elective admissions) compared to 2016-2019 for the six major cardiovascular diseases combined. The proportional reduction in admissions was similar in all three countries. Overall, hospital admissions returned to pre-pandemic levels in 2021. Elective admissions remained substantially below expected levels for almost all conditions in all three countries (−10,996 [-15%] fewer admissions).

Whether Long COVID is one or several distinct syndromes is unknown. Establishing the evidence base for appropriate therapies is needed. We aim to evaluate the symptom burden and underlying pathophysiology of Long COVID syndromes in non-hospitalised individuals and evaluate potential therapies. <h4>Methods and analysis</h4> A cohort of 4000 non-hospitalised individuals with a past COVID-19 diagnosis and 1000 matched controls will be selected from anonymised primary care records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and invited by their general practitioners to participate on a digital platform (Atom5™). Individuals will report symptoms, quality of life, work capability, and patient reported outcome measures. Data will be collected monthly for one year. Statistical clustering methods will be used to identify distinct Long COVID symptom clusters. Individuals from the four most prevalent clusters and two control groups will be invited to participate in the BioWear sub-study which will further phenotype Long COVID symptom clusters by measurement of immunological parameters and actigraphy. We will review existing evidence on interventions for post-viral syndromes and Long COVID to map and prioritise interventions for each newly characterised Long COVID syndrome. Recommendations will be made using the cumulated evidence in an expert consensus workshop. A virtual supportive intervention will be coproduced with patients and health service providers for future evaluation. Individuals with lived experience of Long COVID will be involved throughout this programme through a patient and public involvement group. <h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4> Ethical approval was obtained from the Solihull Research Ethics Committee, West Midlands (21/WM/0203). The study is registered on the ISRCTN Registry (1567490). Research findings will be presented at international conferences, in peer-reviewed journals, to Long COVID patient support groups and to policymakers. <h4>Article Summary</h4> <h4>Strengths and limitations of the study</h4> The study will generate a nationally representative cohort of individuals with Long COVID recruited from primary care. We will recruit controls matched on a wide range of demographic and clinical factors to assess differences in symptoms between people with Long COVID and similar individuals without a history of COVID-19. We will use a newly developed electronic patient reported outcome measure (Symptom Burden Questionnaire™) for Long COVID to comprehensively assess a wide range of symptoms highlighted by existing literature, patients, and clinicians. Immunological, proteomic, genetic, and wearable data captured in the study will allow deep phenotyping of Long COVID syndromes to help better target therapies. A limitation is that a significant proportion of non-hospitalised individuals affected by COVID-19 in the first wave of the pandemic will lack confirmatory testing and will be excluded from recruitment to the study.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/12/21/2021.12.20.21268098.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.20.21268098; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR435279; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR435279&type=FILE&fileName=EMS141852-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Only small areas in their ‘Vitamin D winter’ (monthly mean UV vitd of under 165 KJ/m 2 ) from Jan to April 2020. Participants The ‘at-risk’ population is the total small area population, with measures to incorporate spatial infection into the model. The model is adjusted for potential confounders including long-term winter temperature and humidity. <h4>Main outcome measures</h4> We derive UVA measures for each area from remote sensed data and estimate their relationship with COVID-19 mortality with a random effect for States, in a multilevel zero-inflated negative binomial model. In the USA and England death certificates had to record COVID-19. In Italy excess deaths in 2020 over expected from 2015-19. <h4>Data sources</h4> Satellite derived mean daily UVA dataset from Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. Data on deaths compiled by Center for Disease Control (USA), Office for National Statistics (England) and Italian Institute of Statistics. <h4>Results</h4> Daily mean UVA (January-April 2020) varied between 450 to 1,000 KJ/m 2 across the three countries. Our fully adjusted model showed an inverse correlation between UVA and COVID-19 mortality with a Mortality Risk Ratio (MRR) of 0.71 (0.60 to 0.85) per 100KJ/m 2 increase UVA in the USA, 0.81 (0.71 to 0.93) in Italy and 0.49 (0.38 to 0.64) in England. Pooled MRR was 0.68 (0.52 to 0.88). <h4>Conclusions</h4> Our analysis, replicated in 3 independent national datasets, suggests ambient UVA exposure is associated with lower COVID-19 specific mortality. This effect is independent of vitamin D, as it occurred at irradiances below that likely to induce significant cutaneous vitamin D3 synthesis. Causal interpretations must be made cautiously in observational studies.

Of these patients, 18,210 (18%) received treatment; sotrovimab, 9,340 (51%); molnupiravir, 4,500 (25%); Paxlovid, 4,290 (24%); casirivimab, 50 (<1%); and remdesivir, 20 (<1%). The proportion of patients treated increased from 8% (180/2,380) in the first week of treatment availability to 22% (420/1870) in the latest week. The proportion treated varied by high risk group, lowest in those with Liver disease (12%; 95% CI 11 to 13); by treatment type, with sotrovimab favoured over molnupiravir/Paxlovid in all but three high risk groups: Down syndrome (36%; 95% CI 31 to 40), Rare neurological conditions (46%; 95% CI 44 to 48), and Primary immune deficiencies (49%; 95% CI 48 to 51); by ethnicity, from Black (10%; 95% CI 9 to 11) to White (18%; 95% CI 18 to 19); by NHS Region, from 11% (95% CI 10 to 12) in Yorkshire and the Humber to 23% (95% CI 22 to 24) in the East of England); and by deprivation level, from 12% (95% CI 12 to 13) in the most deprived areas to 21% (95% CI 21 to 22) in the least deprived areas. There was also lower coverage among unvaccinated patients (5%; 95% CI 4 to 7), those with dementia (5%; 95% CI 4 to 6) and care home residents (6%; 95% CI 5 to 6). <h4>Conclusions</h4> Using the OpenSAFELY platform we were able to identify patients who were potentially eligible to receive treatment and assess the coverage of these new treatments amongst these patients. Targeted activity may be needed to address apparent lower treatment coverage observed among certain groups, in particular (at present): different NHS regions, socioeconomically deprived areas, and care homes. <h4>What is already known about this topic</h4> Since the emergence of COVID-19, a number of approaches to treatment have been tried and evaluated. These have mainly consisted of treatments such as dexamethasone, which were used in UK hospitals,from early on in the pandemic to prevent progression to severe disease. Until recently (December 2021), no treatments have been widely used in community settings across England. <h4>What this study adds</h4> Following the rollout of antiviral medicines and neutralising monoclonal antibodies (nMABs) as treatment for patients with COVID-19, we were able to identify patients who were potentially eligible to receive antivirals or nMABs and assess the coverage of these new treatments amongst these patients, in as close to real-time as the available data flows would support. While the proportion of the potentially eligible patients receiving treatment increased over time, rising from 8% (180/2,380) in the first week of the roll out to 22% (420/1870) in the last week of April 2022, there were variations in coverage between key clinical, geographic, and demographic subgroup. <h4>How this study might affect research, practice, or policy</h4> Targeted activity may therefore be needed to address lower treatment rates observed among certain geographic areas and key groups including ethnic minorities, people living in areas of higher deprivation, and in care homes.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/06/01/2022.03.07.22272026.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.07.22272026; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR466607; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR466607&type=FILE&fileName=EMS145672-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Many governments have begun to implement lockdown exit strategies that allow restrictions to be relaxed while attempting to control the risk of a surge in cases. Mathematical modelling has played a central role in guiding interventions, but the challenge of designing optimal exit strategies in the face of ongoing transmission is unprecedented. Here, we report discussions from the Isaac Newton Institute 'Models for an exit strategy' workshop (11-15 May 2020). A diverse community of modellers who are providing evidence to governments worldwide were asked to identify the main questions that, if answered, will allow for more accurate predictions of the effects of different exit strategies. Based on these questions, we propose a roadmap to facilitate the development of reliable models to guide exit strategies. The roadmap requires a global collaborative effort from the scientific community and policy-makers, and is made up of three parts: i) improve estimation of key epidemiological parameters; ii) understand sources of heterogeneity in populations; iii) focus on requirements for data collection, particularly in Low-to-Middle-Income countries.

These measures carry a high economic and social cost. They may have little impact on COVID-19 epidemics if there are many more cases resulting from local transmission compared to imported cases. <h4>Methods</h4> To inform decisions about international travel restrictions, we compared the ratio of expected COVID-19 cases from international travel (assuming no travel restrictions) to the expected COVID-19 cases arising from internal spread on an average day in May 2020 in each country. COVID-19 prevalence and incidence were estimated using a modelling framework that adjusts reported cases for under-ascertainment and asymptomatic infections. <h4>Findings</h4> With May 2019 travel volumes, imported cases account for <10% of total incidence in 103 (95% credible interval: 76 − 130) out of 142 countries, and <1% in 48 (95% CrI: 9 − 95). If we assume that travel would decrease compared to May 2019 even in the absence of formal restrictions, then imported cases account for <10% of total incidence in 109-123 countries and <1% in 61-88 countries (depending on the assumptions about travel reductions). <h4>Interpretation</h4> While countries can expect infected travellers to arrive in the absence of travel restrictions, in most countries these imported cases likely contribute little to local COVID-19 epidemics. Stringent travel restrictions may have limited impact on epidemic dynamics except in countries with low COVID-19 incidence and large numbers of arrivals from other countries. <h4>Funding</h4> Wellcome Trust, UK Department for International Development, European Commission, National Institute for Health Research, Medical Research Council, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> Countries are at different stages of COVID-19 epidemics, so many have implemented policies to minimise the risk of importing cases via international travel. Such policies include border closures, flight suspensions, quarantine and self-isolation on international arrivals. Searching PubMed and MedRxiv using the search: (“covid” OR “coronavirus” OR “SARS-CoV-2”) AND (“travel” OR “restrictions” OR “flight” OR “flights” OR “border”) from 1 January – 10 July 2020 returned 118 and 84 studies respectively, of which 39 were relevant to our study. These studies either concentrated in detail on the risk of importation to specific countries or used a single epidemiological or travel dataset to estimate risk. Most of them focused on the risk of COVID-19 introduction from China or other countries with cases earlier in 2020. No study combined country-specific travel data, prevalence estimates and incidence estimates to assess the global risk of importation relative to current local transmission within countries. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> We combined data on airline passengers and flight frequencies with estimates of COVID-19 prevalence and incidence (adjusted for underreporting and asymptomatic cases), to estimate the risk of imported cases, relative to the level of local transmission in each country. This allows decision makers to determine where travel restriction policies make large contributions to slowing local transmission, and where they have very little overall effect. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> In most countries, imported cases would make a relatively small contribution to local transmission, so travel restrictions would have very little effect on epidemics. Countries where travel restrictions would have a large effect on local transmission are those with strong travel links to countries with high COVID-19 prevalence and/or countries which have successfully managed to control their local outbreaks.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/07/14/2020.07.12.20152298.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.12.20152298; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR186981; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR186981&type=FILE&fileName=EMS87133-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Vaccines against the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may become available as early as late 2020. We explored the health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 immunisation alongside physical distancing scenarios in the UK. <h4>Methods</h4> We used an age-structured dynamic-transmission and economic model to explore different scenarios of immunisation programmes over ten years. Assuming vaccines are effective in 5-64 year olds, we compared vaccinating 90% of individuals in this age group to no vaccination. We assumed either vaccine effectiveness of 25% and 1-year protection and 90% re-vaccinated annually, or 75% vaccine effectiveness and 10-year protection and 10% re-vaccinated annually. Natural immunity was assumed to last 45 weeks in the base case. We also explored the additional impact of physical distancing. We considered benefits from disease prevented in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs to the healthcare payer versus the national economy. We discounted at 3.5% annually and monetised health impact at £20,000 per QALY to obtain the net monetary value, which we explored in sensitivity analyses. <h4>Findings</h4> Without vaccination and physical distancing, we estimated 147.9 million COVID-19 cases (95% uncertainty interval: 48.5 million, 198.7 million) and 2.8 million (770,000, 4.2 million) deaths in the UK over ten years. Vaccination with 75% vaccine effectiveness and 10-year protection may stop community transmission entirely for several years, whereas SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic without highly effective vaccines. Introducing vaccination compared to no vaccination leads to economic gains (positive net monetary value) of £0.37 billion to +£1.33 billion across all physical distancing and vaccine effectiveness scenarios from the healthcare perspective, but net monetary values of physical distancing scenarios may be negative from societal perspective if the daily national economy losses are persistent and large. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Our model findings highlight the substantial health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Given uncertainty around both characteristics of the eventually licensed vaccines and long-term COVID-19 epidemiology, our study provides early insights about possible future scenarios in a post-vaccination era from an economic and epidemiological perspective. <h4>Research in Context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We searched PubMed and medRxiv for economic evaluations of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines with the search string (coronavirus OR COVID OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (vaccin* OR immunisation) AND ((economic evaluation) OR (cost effectiveness analysis)) AND 2020[dp] on September 21, 2020, with no language restrictions. We found one pre-print that valued health outcomes in monetary terms and explored the additional impact of vaccines in a cost-benefit analysis of physical distancing for the USA; no study focused on vaccines in a full economic evaluation. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> With a growing number of vaccine candidates under development and having entered clinical trials, our study is to our knowledge the first to explore the health and economic value of introducing a national SARS-CoV-2 immunisation programme. A programme with high vaccine effectiveness and long-lasting protection may stop the community transmission entirely for a couple of years, but even a vaccine with 25% vaccine effectiveness is worthwhile to use; even at short-lived natural and vaccine-induced protections. After an initial lockdown, voluntary physical distancing as a sole strategy risks a large second epidemic peak, unless accompanied by highly effective immunisation. Compared to no vaccination, introducing vaccination leads to positive net monetary value across physical distancing scenarios from the healthcare perspective, subject to the long-run vaccine price and cost-effectiveness of other treatments (e.g. new drugs). The net monetary value of immunisation decreases if vaccine introduction is delayed, natural immunity is long or vaccine-induced protection is short. Intermittent physical distancing leads to negative net benefits from the perspective of the wider economy if the daily national income losses are persistent and large. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Our model findings highlight the health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to control the COVID-19 epidemic. Despite the many uncertainties, continued physical distancing may be needed to reduce community transmission until vaccines with sufficiently high vaccine effectiveness and long-lasting protection are available. Our study provides first broad health-economic insights rather than precise quantitative projections given the many uncertainties and unknown characteristics of the vaccine candidates and aspects of the long-term COVID-19 epidemiology, and the value of vaccines will ultimately depend on other socioeconomic and health-related policies and population behaviours.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/09/25/2020.09.24.20200857.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.24.20200857; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR218540; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR218540&type=FILE&fileName=EMS96318-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to either usual standard of care alone (usual care group) or usual care plus baricitinib 4 mg once daily by mouth for 10 days or until discharge if sooner (baricitinib group). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality assessed in the intention-to-treat population. A meta-analysis was conducted that included the results from the RECOVERY trial and all previous randomised controlled trials of baricitinib or other JAK inhibitor in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. The RECOVERY trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT04381936 ). <h4>Findings</h4> Between 2 February 2021 and 29 December 2021, 8156 patients were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus baricitinib versus usual care alone. At randomisation, 95% of patients were receiving corticosteroids and 23% receiving tocilizumab (with planned use within the next 24 hours recorded for a further 9%). Overall, 513 (12%) of 4148 patients allocated to baricitinib versus 546 (14%) of 4008 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (age-adjusted rate ratio 0·87; 95% CI 0·77-0·98; p=0·026). This 13% proportional reduction in mortality was somewhat smaller than that seen in a meta-analysis of 8 previous trials of a JAK inhibitor (involving 3732 patients and 425 deaths) in which allocation to a JAK inhibitor was associated with a 43% proportional reduction in mortality (rate ratio 0.57; 95% CI 0.45-0.72). Including the results from RECOVERY into an updated meta-analysis of all 9 completed trials (involving 11,888 randomised patients and 1484 deaths) allocation to baricitinib or other JAK inhibitor was associated with a 20% proportional reduction in mortality (rate ratio 0.80; 95% CI 0.71-0.89; p<0.001). In RECOVERY, there was no significant excess in death or infection due to non-COVID-19 causes and no excess of thrombosis, or other safety outcomes. <h4>Interpretation</h4> In patients hospitalised for COVID-19, baricitinib significantly reduced the risk of death but the size of benefit was somewhat smaller than that suggested by previous trials. The total randomised evidence to date suggests that JAK inhibitors (chiefly baricitinib) reduce mortality in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 by about one-fifth. <h4>Funding</h4> UK Research and Innovation (Medical Research Council) and National Institute of Health Research (Grant ref: MC_PC_19056).",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/03/03/2022.03.02.22271623.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.02.22271623; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR463503; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR463503&type=FILE&fileName=EMS148878-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

In people with CKD, we investigated comorbidities, and 1-year pre- and post-COVID-19 mortality.<br><br>Methods: In linked primary and secondary care electronic health records (CPRD data) for 3,862,012 individuals aged ≥ 30 years registered with a practice between 1997 and 2017, we identified individuals with CKD. We analysed prevalence of common comorbidities across incident and prevalent CKD, CKD stages, ethnic groups, sex, and age, using validated, openly available phenotypes. Using our published model, we estimated 1-year mortality at baseline and during the COVID-19 pandemic at different levels of population infection rate (IR) and relative risk (RR) of mortality associated with the pandemic. We used CPRD data for model development and contemporary English population during pandemic (NHS Digital Trusted Research Environment (TRE) for England: n=54 million (CKD: 2.3 million) from 1 March 2020 until 1 March 2021) for validation.<br><br>Findings: We identified 294,381 (mean age 72.5 years; and female: 59%) and 55,691 (mean 74.8 years and female: 62%) individuals with incident and prevalent CKD, respectively.

With the continued increase in numbers of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, describing the characters of individuals who have experienced a COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough could be hugely important in helping to determine who may be at greatest risk. <h4>Method</h4> With the approval of NHS England we conducted a retrospective cohort study using routine clinical data from the OpenSAFELY TPP database of fully vaccinated individuals, linked to secondary care and death registry data, and described the characteristics of those experiencing a COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough. <h4>Results</h4> As of 01 st November 2021, a total of 15,436,455 individuals were identified as being fully vaccinated against COVID-19, with a median follow-up time of 149 days (IQR: 107-179). From within this population, a total of 577245 (<4%) individuals reported a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. For every 1000 years of patient follow-up time, the corresponding incidence rate was 98.02 (95% CI 97.9-98.15). There were 16,120 COVID-19-related hospital admissions, 1,100 COVID-19 critical care admission patients and 3,925 COVID-19-related deaths; corresponding incidence rates of 2.72 (95% C 2.7-2.74), 0.19 (95% C 0.18-0.19) and 0.66 (95% C 0.65-0.67), respectively. When broken down by the initial priority group, higher rates of hospitalisation and death were seen in those in care homes and those over 80 years of age. Comorbidities with the highest rates of breakthrough COVID-19 included chronic kidney disease, dialysis, transplant, haematological malignancy, and immunocompromised. <h4>Conclusion</h4> The majority of COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough cases in England were mild with relatively few fully vaccinated individuals being hospitalised or dying as a result. However, some concerning differences in rates of breakthrough cases were identified in several clinical and demographic groups. While it is important to note that these findings are simply descriptive and cannot be used to answer why certain groups have higher rates of COVID-19 breakthrough than others, the emergence of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 coupled with the continued increase in numbers of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests are concerning. As numbers of fully vaccinated individuals increases and follow-up time lengthens, so too will the number of COVID-19 breakthrough cases. Additional analyses, aimed at identifying individuals at higher risk, are therefore required.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/12/16/2021.11.08.21265380.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.08.21265380; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR416505; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR416505&type=FILE&fileName=EMS138253-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Previous studies, highlighting ethnic and occupational inequalities in redeployment, are limited by small cohorts with limited ethnic diversity. <h4>Aims</h4> To assess how ethnicity, migration status, and occupation are associated with HCWs’ redeployment experiences during COVID-19 in a nationwide ethnically diverse sample. <h4>Methods</h4> We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from the nationwide United Kingdom Research Study into Ethnicity And COVID-19 outcomes in Healthcare workers (UK-REACH) cohort study. We used logistic regression to examine associations of ethnicity, migration status, and occupation with redeployment experiences of HCWs, including provision of training and supervision, patient contact during redeployment and interaction with COVID-19 patients. <h4>Results</h4> Of the 10,889 HCWs included, 20.4% reported being redeployed during the first UK national lockdown in March 2020. Those in nursing roles (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.22, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.04 – 1.42, p=0.009) (compared to medical roles) had higher likelihood of being redeployed as did migrants compared to those born in the UK (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.06 - 1.49, p=0.01) (in a subcohort of HCWs on the agenda for change (AfC) pay scales). Asian HCWs were less likely to report receiving training (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.50 – 0.88, p=0.005) and Black HCWs (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.14 – 3.57, p=0.02) were more likely to report receiving supervision, compared to White colleagues. Finally, redeployed Black (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.07 – 1.66, p=0.009) and Asian HCWs (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.14 – 1.48, p<0.001) were more likely to report face-to-face interaction with COVID-19 patients than White HCWs. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Our findings highlight disparities in HCWs’ redeployment experiences by ethnicity, migration, and job role which are potentially related to structural inequities in healthcare. For future emergencies, redeployment should be contingent upon risk assessments, accompanied by training and supervision tailored to individual HCWs’ experience and skillset. What is already known on this topic: Ethnic minority healthcare workers (HCWs) were at an elevated risk of infection during COVID-19 due to occupational and socio-demographic factors. The strain on healthcare systems during the pandemic resulted in acute staffing shortages, prompting redeployment of HCWs to areas outside their professional training. However, recent research suggests inconsistent implementation of redeployment across ethnic groups, revealing structural disparities within the healthcare system. What this study adds: Our study, the largest of its kind, found no ethnic differences in the process of redeployment itself, but disparities emerged in the experiences of redeployment. Asian HCWs reported less likelihood of receiving training, while Black HCWs reported more likelihood of receiving supervision compared to their White counterparts. Ethnic minority HCWs were also more likely to report interaction with COVID-19 patients than their White colleagues. While there were no ethnic differences in the process of redeployment, occupational and migration differences reveal that those in nursing and midwifery roles (in comparison to medical roles), as well as migrant HCWs on the AfC payscale (in comparison to those born in the UK), were more likely to report being redeployed. How this study might affect research, practice or policy: This UK-wide study highlights inconsistencies in the redeployment process, training, supervision, and patient interactions based on occupation, ethnicity and migration status. Further investigation, incorporating qualitative and human resources data, is crucial to understand the complexities and address potential structural discrimination within the NHS. For future practice, redeployment should align with risk assessments and include training and supervision tailored to HCWs’ experience and skillset. <h4>Teaser text</h4> This study explores how ethnicity, migration status, and occupation were associated with healthcare workers’ (HCWs) redeployment experiences during COVID-19. After adjustment of covariates, we found that nursing roles and migration to the UK increase redeployment likelihood. Asian HCWs reported lesser training and Black HCWs reported more supervision, compared to White colleagues. Redeployed Black and Asian HCWs were more likely to report interaction with COVID-19 patients. Findings highlight disparities in HCWs’ redeployment experiences in an ethnically diverse sample.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2024/03/04/2024.03.03.24303615.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.03.24303615; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR814122; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR814122&type=FILE&fileName=EMS194583-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We stratified the adult population into 20-49, 50-59, 60-69, and 70+ years. The dynamic effect of the vaccination campaign on mortality rates was estimated using Differences-in-Differences. The prevented and preventable deaths (observed deaths higher than expected), and Potential Years of Life Lost (PYLL), for each age group were obtained in a counterfactual analysis. <br><br>Findings: During the first year of COVID-19 vaccination 266,153,517 doses were administered, achieving 91% first-dose coverage. 380,594 deaths were reported, being 154,091 (40%) in 70+, and 136,804 (36%) from 50-59 or 20-49 years. The mortality rates of 70+ decreased 52% (RRR [95% CI]: 0.48 [0.43-0.53]) in 6 months, whereas rates for 20-49 were still increasing due to the low coverage (52%). The vaccination roll-out strategy prevented 59,618 deaths, 53,088 (89%) from those aged 70+ years. However, the strategy did not prevent 54,797 deaths, 85% from those under 60 years, being 26,344 (45%) only in 20-49, corresponding to 1,589,271 PYLL, being 1,080,104 PYLL (68%) from those aged 20-49 years.<br><br>Interpretation: The adopted aged-based calendar vaccination strategy initially reduced the mortality in the oldest, but did not significantly prevent the deaths of the youngest.

We aimed to investigate whether risks of hospital admission and death, overall and by specific cause, are raised following discharge from a COVID-19 hospitalisation. <h4>Methods and Findings</h4> Working on behalf of NHS-England, we used linked primary care and hospital data in OpenSAFELY to compare risks of hospital admission and death, overall and by specific cause, between people discharged from COVID-19 hospitalisation (February-December 2020), and (i) demographically-matched controls from the 2019 general population; (ii) people discharged from influenza hospitalisation in 2017-19. We used Cox regression adjusted for personal and clinical characteristics. 24,673 post-discharge COVID-19 patients, 123,362 general population controls, and 16,058 influenza controls were followed for ≤315 days. Overall risk of hospitalisation or death (30968 events) was higher in the COVID-19 group than general population controls (adjusted-HR 2.23, 2.14-2.31) but similar to the influenza group (adjusted-HR 0.94, 0.91-0.98). All-cause mortality (7439 events) was highest in the COVID-19 group (adjusted-HR 4.97, 4.58-5.40 vs general population controls and 1.73, 1.60-1.87 vs influenza controls). Risks for cause-specific outcomes were higher in COVID-19 survivors than general population controls, and largely comparable between COVID-19 and influenza patients. However, COVID-19 patients were more likely than influenza patients to be readmitted/die due to their initial infection/other lower respiratory tract infection (adjusted-HR 1.37, 1.22-1.54), and to experience mental health or cognitive-related admission/death (adjusted-HR 1.36, 1.01-2.83); in particular, COVID-19 survivors with pre-existing dementia had higher risk of dementia death. One limitation of our study is that reasons for hospitalisation/death may have been misclassified in some cases due to inconsistent use of codes. <h4>Conclusions</h4> People discharged from a COVID-19 hospital admission had markedly higher risks for rehospitalisation and death than the general population, suggesting a substantial extra burden on healthcare. Most risks were similar to those observed after influenza hospitalisations; but COVID-19 patients had higher risks of all-cause mortality, readmissions/death due to the initial infection, and dementia death, highlighting the importance of post-discharge monitoring.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/07/19/2021.07.16.21260628.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.16.21260628; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR371439; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR371439&type=FILE&fileName=EMS130897-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

However, vaccination trials included limited numbers of older people. <h4>Aim</h4> We aimed to study infection rates of SARS-CoV-2 for older care home residents following vaccination and identify factors associated with increased risk of infection. <h4>Study Design and Setting</h4> We conducted an observational data-linkage study including 14,104 vaccinated older care home residents in Wales (UK) using anonymised electronic health records and administrative data. <h4>Methods</h4> We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection following vaccination, after landmark times of either 7 or 21-days post-vaccination. We adjusted hazard ratios for age, sex, frailty, prior SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccination type. <h4>Results</h4> We observed a small proportion of care home residents with positive PCR tests following vaccination 1.05% (N=148), with 90% of infections occurring within 28-days. For the 7-day landmark analysis we found a reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for vaccinated individuals who had a previous infection; HR (95% confidence interval) 0.54 (0.30,0.95), and an increased HR for those receiving the Pfizer-BioNTECH vaccine compared to the Oxford-AstraZeneca; 3.83 (2.45,5.98).

We assessed the effectiveness of syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival & traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset to enable contact tracing. We assumed that syndromic screening would reduce the number of infected arrivals and that traveller sensitisation reduces the average number of secondary cases. We use stochastic simulations to account for uncertainty in both arrival and secondary infections rates, and present sensitivity analyses on arrival rates of infected travellers and the effectiveness of traveller sensitisation. We report the median expected delay achievable in each scenario and an inner 50% interval. <h4>Results</h4> Under baseline assumptions, introducing exit and entry screening in combination with traveller sensitisation can delay a local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak by 8 days (50% interval: 3-14 days) when the rate of importation is 1 infected traveller per week at time of introduction. The additional benefit of entry screening is small if exit screening is effective: the combination of only exit screening and traveller sensitisation can delay an outbreak by 7 days (50% interval: 2-13 days). In the absence of screening, with less effective sensitisation, or a higher rate of importation, these delays shrink rapidly to less than 4 days. <h4>Conclusion</h4> Syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation in combination may have marginally delayed SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in unaffected countries.",Clifford et al. possible interventions for air travellers that may delay the COVID-19 outbreak in the countries that have not yet had it.

We explored whether the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on antidepressant prescribing trends within these and the general population. <h4>Methods</h4> With the approval of NHS England, we used >24 million patients’ primary care data from the OpenSAFELY-TPP platform. We identified patients with learning disability or autism and used an interrupted time series analysis to quantify trends in those prescribed and newly prescribed an antidepressant across key demographic and clinical subgroups, comparing pre-COVID-19 (January 2018-February 2020), COVID-19 lockdown (March 2020-February 2021) and the recovery period (March 2021-December 2022). <h4>Results</h4> Prior to COVID-19 lockdown, antidepressant prescribing was increasing at 0.3% (95% CI 0.2% to 0.3%) patients per month, in the general population and in those with learning disability, and 0.3% (95% CI 0.2% to 0.4%) in those with autism.

We quantified the outbreak risk under the NPIs already in place, the role of community prevalence in driving outbreaks, and the relative contribution of all importation routes into the care home. We also considered the potential impact of additional control measures, namely: increasing staff and resident testing frequency, using lateral flow antigen testing (LFD) tests instead of PCR, enhancing infection prevention and control (IPC), increasing the proportion of residents isolated, shortening the delay to isolation, improving the effectiveness of isolation, restricting visitors and limiting staff to working in one care home. <h4>Findings</h4> The model suggests that importation of SARS-CoV-2 by staff, from the community, is the main driver of outbreaks, that importation by visitors or from hospitals is rare, and that the past testing strategy (monthly testing of residents and daily testing of staff by PCR) likely provides negligible benefit in preventing outbreaks. Daily staff testing by LFD was 39% (95% 18-55%) effective in preventing outbreaks at 30 days compared to no testing. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Increasing the frequency of testing in staff and enhancing IPC are important to preventing importations to the care home. Further work is needed to understand the impact of vaccination in this population, which is likely to be very effective in preventing outbreaks. <h4>Funding</h4> The National Institute for Health Research, European Union Horizon 2020, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, French National Research Agency, UK Medical Research Council. The World Health Organisation funded the development of the COS-LTCF Shiny application. <h4>Research in Context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> Care homes have been identified as being at increased risk of COVID-19 outbreaks, and a number of modelling studies have considered the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in this setting. We searched the PubMed database and bioRxiv and medRxiv’s COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 preprints for English-language articles on the 11th May 2021, with the search terms (“COVID-19” OR “SARS-CoV-2” OR “coronavirus”) AND (“care home” OR “LTCF” OR “long term care facility” OR “nursing home”) AND (“model”). In addition to these searches, we identified articles relevant to this work through informal networks. These searches returned 87 studies, of which 12 explicitly modelled SARS-CoV-2 transmission within care homes and explored the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions in these settings. These studies employed a number of modelling approaches (agent-based and compartmental models) and considered various strategies for mitigating epidemic spread within care homes. Only one of these studies modelled care homes in England, but didn’t consider individual care homes as separate entities (transmission between residents in separate facilities was equally likely as within one facility) and only modelled one intervention within the care home: the effect of restricting visitors. Another study modelled a different type of long-term care facility, a rehabilitation facility in France. Other studies modelled care homes in Canada, Scotland, and the US. These modelled care homes were larger than the average English care home. Only one study included importation of SARS-CoV-2 to care homes from hospitals through resident hospitalisation. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> We developed a stochastic compartmental model describing the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 within English care homes. This study is the first to assess the relative importance of all SARS-CoV-2 importation routes to care homes (including resident hospitalisation) and to quantify the impact of a range of non-pharmaceutical interventions against SARS-CoV-2 particularly for English care homes. We found that community prevalence, through staff importations, was the main driver of outbreaks in care homes at 30 days, not importation from hospital visits nor by visitors. In line with this, we found daily testing of staff to be the most effective testing strategy in preventing outbreaks. We show the previous testing strategy (PCR testing residents once every 28 days and staff once a week) to be ineffective in preventing outbreaks and suggest that more frequent testing of staff is required. Restricting visitors bore little effect on the probability of an outbreak occurring by day 30. Interventions focusing on decreasing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the care home were the most effective in reducing the frequency of outbreaks. We provide a Shiny application for users to explore alternative care home characteristics, outbreak characteristics and interventions. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Preventing the importation of SARS-CoV-2 to care homes from the community through staff is key to preventing outbreaks. Infection prevention and control (IPC) measures targeting transmission within the care home and frequent testing of staff, ideally daily, are the most effective strategies considered. Many care homes in England are currently unable to meet the additional workload daily testing would entail, therefore additional support should be considered to enable these measures. Allowing visitors should be considered given their general positive contribution to residents’ physical and mental health and likely negligible contribution to outbreaks.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/05/18/2021.05.17.21257315.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.17.21257315; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR341282; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.17.21257315

Eligible and consenting adults were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either usual standard of care alone or usual standard of care plus empagliflozin 10mg once daily for 28 days or until discharge using web-based simple (unstratified) randomisation with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. On 3 March the independent data monitoring committee recommended that the investigators review the data and recruitment was consequently stopped on 7 March. The trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT04381936 ). <h4>Findings</h4> Between 8 July 2021 and 6 March 2023, 4271 patients were randomly allocated to receive either empagliflozin (2113 patients) or usual care alone (2158 patients). Overall, 289 (14%) patients allocated to empagliflozin and 307 (14%) patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82-1.13; p=0.64). There was no evidence of significant differences in duration of hospitalisation (median 8 days vs. 8 days) or the proportion of patients discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (79% vs. 78%; rate ratio 1.03; 95% CI 0.96-1.10; p=0.44). Among those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, there was no evidence of a significant difference in the proportion meeting the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (16% vs. 17%; risk ratio 0.95; 95% CI 0.84-1.08; p=0.44). <h4>Interpretation</h4> In adults hospitalised with COVID-19, empagliflozin was not associated with reductions in 28-day mortality, duration of hospital stay, or risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death. <h4>Funding</h4> UK Research and Innovation (Medical Research Council) and National Institute of Health Research (Grant ref: MC_PC_19056), and Wellcome Trust (Grant Ref: 222406/Z/20/Z). <h4>Trial registration</h4> ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04381936 https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04381936 ISRCTN50189673 http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN50189673",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/04/19/2023.04.13.23288469.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.04.13.23288469; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR648088; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR648088&type=FILE&fileName=EMS174483-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We aimed to describe the impact of pandemic-related disruption on ethnic differences in clinical monitoring and hospital admissions for non-COVID conditions in England. <h4>Methods</h4> We conducted a cohort study using OpenSAFELY (2018-2022). We grouped ethnicity (exposure), into five categories: White, South Asian, Black, Other, Mixed. We used interrupted time-series regression to estimate ethnic differences in clinical monitoring frequency (e.g., blood pressure measurements) before and after 23rd March 2020. We used multivariable Cox regression to quantify ethnic differences in hospitalisations related to: diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and mental health before and after 23rd March 2020. <h4>Findings</h4> Of 14,930,356 adults in 2020 with known ethnicity (92% of sample): 86.6% were White, 7.3% Asian, 2.6% Black, 1.4% Mixed ethnicity, and 2.2% Other ethnicities. Clinical monitoring did not return to pre-pandemic levels for any ethnic group. Ethnic differences were apparent pre-pandemic, except for diabetes monitoring, and remained unchanged, except for blood pressure monitoring in those with mental health conditions where differences narrowed during the pandemic. For those of Black ethnicity, there were seven additional admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis per month during the pandemic, and relative ethnic differences narrowed during the pandemic compared to White. There was increased admissions for heart failure during the pandemic for all ethnic groups, though highest in White ethnicity. Relatively, ethnic differences narrowed for heart failure admission in those of Asian and Black ethnicity compared to White. For other outcomes the pandemic had minimal impact on ethnic differences. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Our study suggests ethnic differences in clinical monitoring and hospitalisations remained largely unchanged during the pandemic for most conditions. Key exceptions were hospitalisations for diabetic ketoacidosis and heart failure, which warrant further investigation to understand the causes. <h4>Funding</h4> LSHTM COVID-19 Response Grant (DONAT15912). <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We searched MEDLINE from inception to 7th September 2022, for articles published in English, including the title/abstract search terms (healthcare disruption OR indirect impact OR miss* diagnos* OR delayed diagnos* OR service disruption) AND (sars-cov-2 OR covid-19 OR pandemic OR lockdown) AND (ethnic*). Of the seven studies identified, two broadly investigated the indirect impacts of the pandemic on non-COVID outcomes and reported ethnic differences. However, these two only included data until January 2021 at the latest. Other studies investigated just one disease area such as dementia or diabetes and frequently did not have the power to investigate specific ethnic groups. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> This is one of the largest studies to describe how the pandemic impacted ethnic differences in clinical monitoring at primary care and hospital admissions for non-COVID conditions (across four disease areas: cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, respiratory disease and mental health) in England. A study population of nearly 15 million people, allowed the examination of five ethnic groups, and data until April 2022 allowed the evaluation of impacts for a longer period than previous studies.We showed that clinical monitoring had still not returned to pre-pandemic levels even by April 2022. Ethnic differences in clinical monitoring were seen pre-pandemic, though not in diabetes measures, these differences were either not impacted or reduced during the pandemic. We also showed that there were ethnic differences in hospital admissions, for many outcomes the pandemic did not impact these differences but there were some exceptions, in particular for diabetic ketoacidosis admissions in those of Black ethnicity and heart failure admissions for those of Black and Asian ethnicities. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> We found that the pandemic reduced ethnic inequalities for some outcomes (in hospitalisations for diabetic ketoacidosis and heart failure). However, these were driven by greater absolute increases in admissions for black and asian groups (diabetic ketoacidosis) and white groups (heart failure), which warrant further investigation to understand the underlying causes.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/01/05/2023.01.04.23284174.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.01.04.23284174; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR592262; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR592262&type=FILE&fileName=EMS159410-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

The burden on hospitals during the pandemic could be reduced by implementing prediction models that can discriminate between patients requiring hospitalization and those who do not. The COVID-19 vulnerability (C-19) index, a model that predicts which patients will be admitted to hospital for treatment of pneumonia or pneumonia proxies, has been developed and proposed as a valuable tool for decision making during the pandemic. However, the model is at high risk of bias according to the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool and has not been externally validated. <h4>Methods</h4> We followed the OHDSI framework for external validation to assess the reliability of the C-19 model. We evaluated the model on two different target populations: i) 41,381 patients that have SARS-CoV-2 at an outpatient or emergency room visit and ii) 9,429,285 patients that have influenza or related symptoms during an outpatient or emergency room visit, to predict their risk of hospitalization with pneumonia during the following 0 to 30 days. In total we validated the model across a network of 14 databases spanning the US, Europe, Australia and Asia. <h4>Findings</h4> The internal validation performance of the C-19 index was a c-statistic of 0.73 and calibration was not reported by the authors. When we externally validated it by transporting it to SARS-CoV-2 data the model obtained c-statistics of 0.36, 0.53 (0.473-0.584) and 0.56 (0.488-0.636) on Spanish, US and South Korean datasets respectively. The calibration was poor with the model under-estimating risk. When validated on 12 datasets containing influenza patients across the OHDSI network the c-statistics ranged between 0.40-0.68. <h4>Interpretation</h4> The results show that the discriminative performance of the C-19 model is low for influenza cohorts, and even worse amongst COVID-19 patients in the US, Spain and South Korea. These results suggest that C-19 should not be used to aid decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight the importance of performing external validation across a range of settings, especially when a prediction model is being extrapolated to a different population. In the field of prediction, extensive validation is required to create appropriate trust in a model.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/06/17/2020.06.15.20130328.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.15.20130328; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR176688; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR176688&type=FILE&fileName=EMS88261-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We developed and applied an artificial-intelligence (AI)-based approach to analyse social-media public sentiment in the UK and the US towards COVID-19 vaccinations, to understand public attitude and identify topics of concern. <h4>Methods</h4> Over 300,000 social-media posts related to COVID-19 vaccinations were extracted, including 23,571 Facebook-posts from the UK and 144,864 from the US, along with 40,268 tweets from the UK and 98,385 from the US respectively, from 1 st March - 22 nd November 2020. We used natural language processing and deep learning based techniques to predict average sentiments, sentiment trends and topics of discussion. These were analysed longitudinally and geo-spatially, and a manual reading of randomly selected posts around points of interest helped identify underlying themes and validated insights from the analysis. <h4>Results</h4> We found overall averaged positive, negative and neutral sentiment in the UK to be 58%, 22% and 17%, compared to 56%, 24% and 18% in the US, respectively. Public optimism over vaccine development, effectiveness and trials as well as concerns over safety, economic viability and corporation control were identified. We compared our findings to national surveys in both countries and found them to correlate broadly. <h4>Conclusions</h4> AI-enabled social-media analysis should be considered for adoption by institutions and governments, alongside surveys and other conventional methods of assessing public attitude. This could enable real-time assessment, at scale, of public confidence and trust in COVID-19 vaccinations, help address concerns of vaccine-sceptics and develop more effective policies and communication strategies to maximise uptake.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/12/11/2020.12.08.20246231.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.08.20246231; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR252028; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR252028&type=FILE&fileName=EMS108377-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

The majority of participants were female (60.5% to 65.9%) and aged ≥50 years. The most prevalent autoimmune conditions were psoriasis (3.5 to 32.5%), rheumatoid arthritis (3.9 to 18.9%), and vasculitis (3.3 to 17.6%). Amongst hospitalised patients, Type 1 diabetes was the most common autoimmune condition (4.8% to 7.5%) in US databases, rheumatoid arthritis in HIRA (18.9%), and psoriasis in SIDIAP-H (26.4%). Compared to 70,660 hospitalised with influenza, those admitted with COVID-19 had more respiratory complications including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and higher 30-day mortality (2.2% to 4.3% versus 6.3% to 24.6%). <h4>Conclusions</h4> Patients with autoimmune diseases had high rates of respiratory complications and 30-day mortality following a hospitalization with COVID-19. Compared to influenza, COVID-19 is a more severe disease, leading to more complications and higher mortality. Future studies should investigate predictors of poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients with autoimmune diseases. <h4>What is already known about this topic</h4> Patients with autoimmune conditions may be at increased risk of COVID-19 infection andcomplications. There is a paucity of evidence characterising the outcomes of hospitalised COVID-19 patients with prevalent autoimmune conditions. <h4>What this study adds</h4> Most people with autoimmune diseases who required hospitalisation for COVID-19 were women, aged 50 years or older, and had substantial previous comorbidities. Patients who were hospitalised with COVID-19 and had prevalent autoimmune diseases had higher prevalence of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, heart disease, and Type 2 diabetes as compared to those with prevalent autoimmune diseases who were diagnosed with COVID-19. A variable proportion of 6% to 25% across data sources died within one month of hospitalisation with COVID-19 and prevalent autoimmune diseases.

To date, much of the evidence has been derived from studies within single healthcare settings, mainly those hospitalised with COVID-19. Working on behalf of NHS England, the aim of this study was to identify ethnic differences in the risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation and mortality using a large general population cohort in England. <h4>Methods</h4> We conducted an observational cohort study using linked primary care records of 17.5 million adults between 1 February 2020 and 3 August 2020. Exposure was self-reported ethnicity collapsed into the 5 and 16 ethnicity categories of the English Census. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify ethnic differences in the risk of being tested and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 related intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and COVID-19 mortality, adjusted for socio-demographic factors, clinical co-morbidities, geographic region, care home residency, and household size. <h4>Results</h4> A total of 17,510,002 adults were included in the study; 63% white (n=11,030,673), 6% south Asian (n=1,034,337), 2% black (n=344,889), 2% other (n=324,730), 1% mixed (n=172,551), and 26% unknown (n=4,602,822). After adjusting for measured explanatory factors, south Asian, black, and mixed groups were marginally more likely to be tested (south Asian HR 1.08, 95%CI 1.07-1.09; black HR 1.08; 95%CI 1.06-1.09, mixed HR 1.03, 95%CI 1.01-1.05), and substantially more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with white adults (south Asian HR 2.02. 95% CI 1.97-2.07; black HR 1.68, 95%CI 1.61-1.76; mixed HR 1.46, 95%CI 1.36-1.56). The risk of being admitted to ICU for COVID-19 was substantially increased in all ethnic minority groups compared with white adults (south Asian HR 2.22, 95%CI 1.96-2.52; black HR 3.07, 95%CI 2.61-3.61; mixed HR 2.86, 95%CI 2.19-3.75, other HR 2.86, 95%CI 2.31-3.63). Risk of COVID-19 mortality was increased by 25-56% in ethnic minority groups compared with white adults (south Asian HR 1.27, 95%CI 1.17-1.38; black HR 1.55, 95%CI 1.38-1.75; mixed HR 1.40, 95%CI 1.12-1.76; other HR 1.25, 95%CI 1.05-1.49). We observed heterogeneity of associations after disaggregation into detailed ethnic groupings; Indian and African groups were at higher risk of all outcomes; Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Caribbean groups were less or equally likely to be tested for SARS-CoV-2, but at higher risk of all other outcomes, Chinese groups were less likely to be tested for and test positive for SARS-CoV-2, more likely to be admitted to ICU, and equally likely to die from COVID-19. <h4>Conclusions</h4> We found evidence of substantial ethnic inequalities in the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, ICU admission, and mortality, which persisted after accounting for explanatory factors, including household size. It is likely that some of this excess risk is related to factors not captured in clinical records such as occupation, experiences of structural discrimination, or inequitable access to health and social services.

Study 2: 372,746 people with non-valvular AF. <h4>Main outcome measures</h4> Time to test for SARS-CoV-2, testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 related hospital admission, COVID-19 deaths or non-COVID-19 deaths in Cox regression. <h4>Results</h4> In Study 1, we included 52,416 current OAC users and 18,048 non-users. We observed no difference in risk of being tested for SARS-CoV-2 associated with current use (adjusted HR, 1.01, 95%CI, 0.96 to 1.05) versus non-use. We observed a lower risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (adjusted HR, 0.73, 95%CI, 0.60 to 0.90), and COVID-19 deaths (adjusted HR, 0.69, 95%CI, 0.49 to 0.97) associated with current use versus non-use. In Study 2, we included 92,339 warfarin users and 280,407 DOAC users. We observed a lower risk of COVID-19 deaths (adjusted HR, 0.79, 95%CI, 0.76 to 0.83) associated with warfarin versus DOACs. Similar associations were found for all other outcomes. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Among people with AF and a CHA□DS□-VASc score of 2, those receiving OACs had a lower risk of receiving a positive COVID-19 test and severe COVID-19 outcomes than non-users; this might be explained by a causal effect of OACs in preventing severe COVID-19 outcomes or more cautious behaviours leading to reduced infection risk. There was no evidence of a higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes associated with warfarin versus DOACs in people with non-valvular AF regardless of CHA□DS□-VASc score. <h4>Key points</h4> <h4>What is already known on this topic</h4> Current studies suggest that prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulant use, particularly low molecular weight heparin, lower the risk of pulmonary embolism and mortality during hospitalisation among patients with COVID-19. Reduced vitamin K status has been reported to be correlated with severity of COVID-19. This could mean that warfarin, as a vitamin K antagonist, is associated with more severe COVID-19 disease than non-vitamin K anticoagulants. <h4>What this study adds</h4> In 70,464 people with atrial fibrillation, at the threshold of being treated with an OAC based on risk of stroke, we observed a lower risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 related deaths associated with routinely prescribed OACs, relative to non-use. This might be explained by OACs preventing severe COVID-19 outcomes, or more cautious behaviours and environmental factors reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in those taking OACs. In 372,746 people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, there was no evidence of a higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes associated with warfarin compared with DOACs.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/04/30/2021.04.30.21256119.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.30.21256119; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR319210; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR319210&type=FILE&fileName=EMS123890-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We aimed to explore whether this impacted the prescribing rates of antipsychotics within at-risk populations. <h4>Methods</h4> With the approval of NHS England, we completed a retrospective cohort study, using the OpenSAFELY platform to explore primary care data of 59 million patients. We identified patients in five at-risk groups: autism, dementia, learning disability, serious mental illness and care home residents. We then calculated the monthly prevalence of antipsychotic prescribing in the population, as well as the incidence of new prescriptions in each month over the study period (Jan 2019-Dec 2021). <h4>Results</h4> The average monthly rate of antipsychotic prescribing increased in dementia from 82.75 patients prescribed an antipsychotic per 1000 patients (95% CI 82.30-83.19) in Q1 2019 to 90.1 (95% CI 89.68-90.60) in Q4 2021 and from 154.61 (95% CI 153.79-155.43) in Q1 2019 to 166.95 (95% CI 166.23-167.67) in Q4 2021 in care homes.

We used a simulation model of air travellers arriving to the UK from the EU or the USA and the timing of their stages of infection to evaluate the ability of these strategies to reduce the risk of seeding community transmission. We find that a quarantine period of 8 days on arrival with a PCR test on day 7 (with a 1-day delay for test results) can reduce the number of infectious arrivals released into the community by a median 94% compared to a no quarantine, no test scenario. This reduction is similar to that achieved by a 14-day quarantine period (median 99% reduction). Shorter quarantine periods still can prevent a substantial amount of transmission; all strategies in which travellers spend at least 5 days (the mean incubation period) in quarantine and have at least one negative test before release are highly effective (e.g. a test on day 5 with release on day 6 results in a median 88% reduction in transmission potential). Without intervention, the current high prevalence in the US (40 per 10,000) results in a higher expected number of infectious arrivals per week (up to 23) compared to the EU (up to 12), despite an estimated 8 times lower volume of travel in July 2020. Requiring a 14-day quarantine period likely results in less than 1 infectious traveller each entering the UK per week from the EU and the USA (97.5th percentile). We also find that on arrival the transmission risk is highest from pre-symptomatic travellers; quarantine policies will shift this risk increasingly towards asymptomatic infections if eventually-symptomatic individuals self-isolate after the onset of symptoms. As passenger numbers recover, strategies to reduce the risk of re-introduction should be evaluated in the context of domestic SARS-CoV-2 incidence, preparedness to manage new outbreaks, and the economic and psychological impacts of quarantine.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/07/25/2020.07.24.20161281.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.24.20161281; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR191930; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR191930&type=FILE&fileName=EMS87861-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Patients may try several before an effective, well-tolerated drug is identified, delaying symptom improvement. We aimed to develop a personalised selection tool to identify the optimum first-line antipsychotic, based on individual sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. <h4>Methods</h4> Risk prediction development and validation study using electronic health records (EHRs) from primary care in England (Clinical Practice Research Datalink) linked to Hospital Episode Statistics, including 11,811 individuals with incident SMI prescribed aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine or risperidone as first-line treatment between 2007-2016. The outcome was time to psychiatric hospitalisation or change to different antipsychotic within 3 years of commencing treatment. Prediction algorithms were developed using Cox proportional hazards models in a 70% training sample and validated in a 30% hold-out sample. This baseline model was compared with machine learning survival models of increasing complexity. Potential predictors included demographics, diagnoses, concomitant medications and laboratory findings. <h4>Outcomes</h4> Among 8,225 individuals in the development cohort, 4,456 (54.2%) experienced the outcome. In model validations, 1,022 (53.3%) of 1,916 in the validation cohort did not receive the optimal antipsychotic identified by the personalised selection tool. The predicted 3-year outcome risk if all individuals received the medication assigned by the tool was 6.3% lower (95% CI 4.0%-8.5%) than the observed 3-year risk in the validation cohort, and 10.2% lower (95%CI 7.9%-12.5%) than if individuals were randomly assigned an antipsychotic (corresponding numbers need to treat of 16 and 10). Machine learning approaches did not meaningfully improve model performance. <h4>Interpretation</h4> A personalised tool based on EHR data could improve treatment success rates by optimising first-line antipsychotic selection. Machine learning did not outperform traditional prediction methods. Further research will assess the impact on adverse events and in other populations. <h4>Funding</h4> UK Research and Innovation grant MR/V023373/1. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We searched PubMed for articles published from database inception to December 13, 2024, with no language restrictions. We searched titles and abstracts using the terms ((prediction) AND ((treatment response) OR (treatment rule) OR (treatment outcome)) AND ((psychosis) OR (severe mental illness) OR (schizophrenia) OR (bipolar disorder))). We identified 187 articles for full text screening. A number of studies exist on the prediction of lithium treatment response. A recent systematic review summarised the results of eight studies that used biomarkers, clinical and socio-demographic features to predict treatment response in psychosis, however these commonly compared responders with non-responders, rather than developing treatment selection rules. Two studies did generate treatment selection recommendations. One used a Super Learner in Taiwan National Health insurance data to optimise antipsychotic selection in first episode psychosis, resulting in a 7% improvement in estimated treatment success rate. The second examined antipsychotic selection, choosing between risperidone and aripiprazole, in children using Korean National Health insurance data and found a 1.2-1.5 times increase in antipsychotic continuation using their model compared to their allocated treatment. They found no improvement in performance when comparing machine learning with simple regression models. Neither model has been externally validated. We could not find any models that are in clinical use. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> We found that a simple treatment selection prediction model, based on data contained in the electronic health records at the point that an individual with severe mental illness is first prescribed an antipsychotic, could reduce treatment failure rates by 6-10%. In our validation cohort 75% of patients were switched to an alternative antipsychotic medication by the treatment selection tool. In line with the limited number of previous studies in this area, we did not observe meaningful improvements in predictive properties when machine learning approaches were compared with traditional models. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Prediction models for optimising treatment selection in psychiatry are becoming increasingly possible with data from electronic health records. Improving treatment selection for people with SMI is low risk, compared to other prediction problems in psychiatry, and could improve long-term outcomes. Models still need full external validation and testing in new cohorts.",,doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.24.25324323; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.24.25324323; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR993659; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR993659&type=FILE&fileName=EMS204143-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Corticosteroids may modulate immune-mediated lung injury and reducing progression to respiratory failure and death. <h4>Methods</h4>  The Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 therapy (RECOVERY) trial is a randomized, controlled, open-label, adaptive, platform trial comparing a range of possible treatments with usual care in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We report the preliminary results for the comparison of dexamethasone 6 mg given once daily for up to ten days vs. usual care alone. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. <h4>Results</h4>  2104 patients randomly allocated to receive dexamethasone were compared with 4321 patients concurrently allocated to usual care. Overall, 454 (21.6%) patients allocated dexamethasone and 1065 (24.6%) patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (age-adjusted rate ratio [RR] 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74 to 0.92; P<0.001). The proportional and absolute mortality rate reductions varied significantly depending on level of respiratory support at randomization (test for trend p<0.001): Dexamethasone reduced deaths by one-third in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (29.0% vs. 40.7%, RR 0.65 [95% CI 0.51 to 0.82]; p<0.001), by one-fifth in patients receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (21.5% vs. 25.0%, RR 0.80 [95% CI 0.70 to 0.92]; p=0.002), but did not reduce mortality in patients not receiving respiratory support at randomization (17.0% vs. 13.2%, RR 1.22 [95% CI 0.93 to 1.61]; p=0.14). <h4>Conclusions</h4>  In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, dexamethasone reduced 28-day mortality among those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen at randomization, but not among patients not receiving respiratory support. <h4>Trial registrations</h4>  The RECOVERY trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov (  NCT04381936 ).  <h4>Funding</h4>  Medical Research Council and National Institute for Health Research (Grant ref: MC_PC_19056).",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/06/22/2020.06.22.20137273.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.22.20137273; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR179288; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR179288&type=FILE&fileName=EMS88343-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Factors associated with pre-existing AT use were analysed using logistic regression. Differences in COVID-19 related hospitalisation and death were analysed using logistic and Cox regression for individuals exposed to pre-existing AT use vs no AT use, anticoagulants (AC) vs antiplatelets (AP) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) vs warfarin. <h4>Results</h4> From 972,971 individuals with AF and a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score>=2, 88.0% (n=856,336) had pre-existing AT use, 3.8% (n=37,418) had a COVID-19 related hospitalisation and 2.2% (n=21,116) died. Factors associated with no AT use included comorbidities that may contraindicate AT use (liver disease and history of falls) and demographics (socioeconomic status and ethnicity). Pre-existing AT use was associated with lower odds of death (OR=0.92 [0 . 87-0 . 96 at 95% CI] ), but higher odds of hospitalisation OR=1.20 [1 . 15-1 . 26 at 95% CI] ). The same pattern was observed for AC vs AP (death (OR=0.93 [0.87-0.98]), hospitalisation (OR=1.17 [1.11-1.24])) but not for DOACs vs warfarin (death (OR=1.00 [0.95-1.05]), hospitalisation (OR=0.86 [0.82-0.89]). <h4>Conclusions</h4> Pre-existing AT use may offer marginal protection against COVID-19 death, with AC offering more protection than AP. Although this association may not be causal, it provides further incentive to improve AT coverage for eligible individuals with AF. <h4>KEY QUESTIONS</h4> <h4>What is already known about this subject?</h4> Anticoagulants (AC), a sub-class of antithrombotics (AT), reduce the risk of stroke and are recommended for individuals with atrial fibrillation (AF) and at high risk of stroke (CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score>=2, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence threshold). However, previous evaluations suggest that up to one third of these individuals may not be taking AC. Over estimation of bleeding and fall risk in elderly patients have been identified as potential factors in this under medicating. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, several observational studies have observed correlations between pre-existing AT use, particularly anticoagulants (AC), and lower risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes such as hospitalisation and death. However, these correlations are inconsistent across studies and have not compared all major sub-types of AT in one study. <h4>What does this study add?</h4> This study uses datasets covering primary care, secondary care, pharmacy dispensing, death registrations, multiple COVID-19 diagnoses routes and vaccination records for 56 million people in England and is the largest scale evaluation of AT use to date. This provides the statistical power to robustly analyse targeted sub-types of AT and control for a wide range of potential confounders. All code developed for the study is opensource and an updated nationwide evaluation can be rapidly created for future time points. In 972,971 individuals with AF and a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score>=2, we observed 88.0% (n=856,336) with pre-existing AT use which was associated with marginal protection against COVID-19 death (OR=0.92 [0 . 87-0 . 96 at 95% CI] ). <h4>How might this impact on clinical practice?</h4> These findings can help shape global AT medication policy and provide population-scale, observational analysis results alongside gold-standard randomised control trials to help assess whether a potential beneficial effect of pre-existing AT use on COVID-19 death alters risk to benefit assessments in AT prescribing decisions.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/09/10/2021.09.03.21263023.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.03.21263023; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR393010; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.03.21263023

We constructed three cohorts: patients discharged following hospitalisation with COVID-19, patients discharged following hospitalisation with pneumonia in 2019, and a frequency-matched cohort from the general population in 2019.

Patients in the COVID-19 population had markedly increased risk of all outcomes compared to matched controls from the 2019 general population, especially for pulmonary embolism (HR 12.86; 95% CI: 11.23 - 14.74).

For 19,515 staff, VE against infection declined slightly from 50·3% (32·7, 63·3) to 42·1% 29·5, 52·4). High VE was restored following a third dose, with VE of 71·6% (53·5, 82·7) and 78·3% (70·1, 84·3) against infection and 89·9% (80·0, 94·6) and 95·8% (50·4, 99·6) against hospitalisation, for residents and staff respectively; and 97·5% (88·1, 99·5) against death for residents. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Substantial waning of VE is observed against all outcomes in residents from 12 weeks after a primary course of AstraZeneca or mRNA vaccines. Boosters restore protection, and maximise immunity across all outcomes. These findings demonstrate the importance of boosting and the need for ongoing surveillance of VE in this vulnerable cohort. <h4>Funding</h4> UK Government Department of Health and Social Care. <h4>Research in Context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We searched MEDLINE and medRxiv for studies reporting vaccine effectiveness (VE) over time after two or three doses against SARS-CoV2 infection, COVID-19-related hospitalisation, or COVID-19-related death amongst staff or residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs), that were published between Jan 1, 2020, and December 21, 2021. We used variations of the search terms “COVID-19” OR “SARS-CoV-2” AND “vaccine effectiveness” OR “vaccine efficacy” AND “care homes” OR “long term care facilities”. We identified 8 articles reporting two-dose data from LTCFs, including 1 peer-reviewed paper from Israel, 1 preprint from Denmark, 1 preprint from Norway, 1 peer-reviewed paper from France, two peer-reviewed papers from Spain, 1 peer-reviewed paper from the USA, and 1 preprint from England; however none of these studies examined waning of protection over time after two doses. Five studies (mRNA vaccines 3-4 weeks interval) reported short-term two-dose VE of 49-71% in residents, and 82-90% in staff. Two-dose VE was reported to be 75-88% against hospitalisation, 87-97% against death, and 86% against either outcome. An English study of residents (Pfizer or AstraZeneca, 8-12 week interval) reported 73% VE against infection and noted VE waning from 7 weeks after the first dose, but did not examine waning after the second dose. All of these studies were set prior to emergence of the Delta variant and did not examine waning of immunity due to short lengths of follow-up after Dose 2. Only one study (USA) compared Pfizer/Moderna two-dose VE against infection in LTCF residents before (67·5% [60·1-73·5%]) and during (53·1% [49·1-56·7%]) Delta variant predominance; however, authors could not access vaccination dates therefore did not account for any waning of immunity over time; they also did not examine any severe clinical outcomes. We identified only one correspondence piece from Israel (Pfizer 3-4 week interval) describing the benefit of a third ‘booster’ dose in LTCFs; it reported relative rate reductions of 71% for infection and 80%, for hospitalisation in the period after booster roll-out. However, individual-level VE estimates by time since vaccination were not reported, and adjustment for prior infection was not undertaken. Overall, there was a paucity of data on non-mRNA vaccines, waning of immunity over time after two doses, and VE following a third (booster) dose in LTCF populations, which we address in this study. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> We report findings from a prospective cohort study that includes 15,518 residents and 19,515 staff from 331 LTCFs across England, who underwent routine PCR testing 2-3 times per month, looking at SARS-CoV2 vaccine effectiveness over 12 months (Dec 8, 2020-Dec 11, 2021), which is the longest duration of follow-up of any study within this vulnerable cohort. We evaluated the effectiveness of first, second, and booster vaccine doses of AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Moderna against infection, hospitalisation, and death over the 12 months when the Alpha and Delta variants were dominant. Our findings affirm that complete vaccination with two doses of AstraZeneca or mRNA vaccines offers moderate protection against infection, and high protection against severe clinical outcomes, however this protection declines over time, particularly for residents. A third booster dose of an mRNA vaccine restores, and indeed maximises, VE to 71·6% (53·5, 82·7) and 78·3% (70·1, 84·3) against infection, and 89·9% (80·0, 94·6) and 95·8% (50·4, 99·6) against hospitalisation, for residents and staff respectively, and to 97·5% (88·1, 99·5) against death for residents, with similar protection offered after the third dose irrespective of primary course type. This is the first study to examine and describe waning of immunity over a one-year period, as well as vaccine effectiveness of a booster dose, in a large cohort of LTCF staff and residents. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Taken together, our findings indicate high short-term immunity against SARS-CoV2 infection and very high immunity against severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19 for LTCF residents and staff following vaccination. However substantial waning in vaccine-derived immunity is seen beyond 3 months, irrespective of vaccine type, suggesting the need for regular boosting to maintain protection in this vulnerable cohort. Although this analysis took place in the pre-Omicron period, these trends of waning immunity over time are likely to be generalisable across variants, carrying important implications for long-term vaccination policy in LTCFs. Ongoing surveillance in this vulnerable cohort remains crucial, in order to describe further changes in vaccine-induced immunity, particularly in the context of new variants.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/03/18/2022.03.09.22272098.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.09.22272098; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR467890; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR467890&type=FILE&fileName=EMS148974-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Statins have been found to reduce the risk of progression from myelodysplastic syndrome to acute myeloid leukaemia and have also shown efficacy in vitro against TET2 deficient AML cell lines. However, their effect on CHIP has not been described. This study characterises the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing as a novel longitudinal CHIP cohort, through genetic analysis of 13270 longitudinal peripheral blood samples from participants aged over 50. Using logistic and robust regression analysis, we show that statin therapy is associated with reduced TET2 CHIP clonal expansion in a gene specific manner. We also find that statin primary prevention is associated with significantly lower incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke in individuals with CHIP compared to controls.

Such coding is usually done manually in hospitals but could potentially be automated to improve the efficiency and accuracy of medical coding. Recent studies on deep learning for automated medical coding achieved promising performances. However, the explainability of these models is usually poor, preventing them to be used confidently in supporting clinical practice. Another limitation is that these models mostly assume independence among labels, ignoring the complex correlation among medical codes which can potentially be exploited to improve the performance. We propose a Hierarchical Label-wise Attention Network (HLAN), which aimed to interpret the model by quantifying importance (as attention weights) of words and sentences related to each of the labels. Secondly, we propose to enhance the major deep learning models with a label embedding (LE) initialisation approach, which learns a dense, continuous vector representation and then injects the representation into the final layers and the label-wise attention layers in the models. We evaluated the methods using three settings on the MIMIC-III discharge summaries: full codes, top-50 codes, and the UK NHS COVID-19 shielding codes. Experiments were conducted to compare HLAN and LE initialisation to the state-of-the-art neural network based methods. HLAN achieved the best Micro-level AUC and $F_1$ on the top-50 code prediction and comparable results on the NHS COVID-19 shielding code prediction to other models. By highlighting the most salient words and sentences for each label, HLAN showed more meaningful and comprehensive model interpretation compared to its downgraded baselines and the CNN-based models.

Emerging emergence has suggested that several factors may be associated with increased risk from severe outcomes or death from COVID-19. Clinical risk prediction tools have significant potential to generate individualised assessment of risk and may be useful for population stratification and other use cases. <h4>Methods and analysis</h4> We will use a prospective open cohort study of routinely collected data from 1205 general practices in England in the QResearch database. The primary outcome is COVID-19 mortality (in or out-of-hospital) defined as confirmed or suspected COVID-19 mentioned on the death certificate, or death occurring in a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection between 24 th January and 30 th April 2020. Our primary outcome in adults is COVID-19 mortality (including out of hospital and in hospital deaths). We will also examine COVID-19 hospitalisation in children. Time-to-event models will be developed in the training data to derive separate risk equations in adults (19-100 years) for males and females for evaluation of risk of each outcome within the 3-month follow-up period (24 th January to 30 th April 2020), accounting for competing risks. Predictors considered will include age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, smoking status, alcohol intake, body mass index, pre-existing medical co-morbidities, and concurrent medication. Measures of performance (prediction errors, calibration and discrimination) will be determined in the test data for men and women separately and by ten-year age group. For children, descriptive statistics will be undertaken if there are currently too few serious events to allow development of a risk model. The final model will be externally evaluated in (a) geographically separate practices and (b) other relevant datasets as they become available. <h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4> The project has ethical approval and the results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. <h4>Strengths and limitations of the study</h4> The individual-level linkage of general practice, Public Health England testing, Hospital Episode Statistics and Office of National Statistics death register datasets enable a robust and accurate ascertainment of outcomes The models will be trained and evaluated in population-representative datasets of millions of individuals Shielding for clinically extremely vulnerable was advised and in place during the study period, therefore risk predictions influenced by the presence of some ‘shielding’ conditions may require careful consideration",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/06/29/2020.06.28.20141986.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.28.20141986; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR181164; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR181164&type=FILE&fileName=EMS87472-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

During the first year of the pandemic, existing demand was not fully met while new demand was generated, resulting in large numbers of people requiring support. To support mental health services to recover without being overwhelmed, it was important to know where services will experience increased pressure, and what strategies could be implemented to mitigate this. <h4>Methods</h4> We implemented a computer simulation model of patient flow through an integrated mental health service in Southwest England covering General Practice (GP), community-based ‘talking therapies’ (IAPT), acute hospital care, and specialist care settings. The model was calibrated on data from 1 April 2019 to 1 April 2021. Model parameters included patient demand, service-level length of stay, and probabilities of transitioning to other care settings. We used the model to compare ‘do nothing’ (baseline) scenarios to ‘what if’ (mitigation) scenarios, including increasing capacity and reducing length of stay, for two future demand trajectories from 1 April 2021 onwards. <h4>Results</h4> The results from the simulation model suggest that, without mitigation, the impact of COVID-19 will be an increase in pressure on GP and specialist community based services by 50% and 50-100% respectively. Simulating the impact of possible mitigation strategies, results show that increasing capacity in lower-acuity services, such as GP, results in demand being shifted to other parts of the mental health system while decreasing length of stay in higher acuity services is insufficient to mitigate the impact of increased demand. <h4>Conclusion</h4> In capturing the interrelation of patient flow related dynamics between various mental health care settings, we demonstrate the value of computer simulation for assessing the impact of interventions on system flow.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/07/23/2023.07.19.23292289.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.19.23292289; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR695721; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.19.23292289

We assess the efficacy of the cordon sanitaire to delay the introduction and onset of local transmission of COVID-19 in other major cities in mainland China. <h4>Methods</h4> We estimated the number of infected travellers from Wuhan to other major cities in mainland China from November 2019 to March 2020 using previously estimated COVID-19 prevalence in Wuhan and publicly available mobility data. We focused on Beijing, Chongqing, Hangzhou, and Shenzhen as four representative major cities to identify the potential independent contribution of the cordon sanitaire and holiday travel. To do this, we simulated outbreaks generated by infected arrivals in these destination cities using stochastic branching processes. We also modelled the effect of the cordon sanitaire in combination with reduced transmissibility scenarios representing the effect of local non-pharmaceutical interventions. <h4>Findings</h4> In the four cities, given the potentially high prevalence of COVID-19 in Wuhan between Dec 2019 and early Jan 2020, local transmission may have been seeded as early as 2 - 8 January 2020. By the time the cordon sanitaire was imposed, simulated case counts were likely in the hundreds. The cordon sanitaire alone did not substantially affect the epidemic progression in these cities, although it may have had some effect in smaller cities. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Our results indicate that the cordon sanitaire may not have prevented COVID-19 spread in major Chinese cities; local non-pharmaceutical interventions were likely more important for this. <h4>Research in Context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> In late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was detected in Wuhan, China. In response to the outbreak, authorities enacted a cordon sanitaire in order to limit spread. Several studies have sought to determine the efficacy of the policy; a search of PubMed for “coronavirus AND (travel restrictions OR travel ban OR shutdown OR cordon sanitaire) AND (Wuhan OR China)” returned 24 results. However other studies have relied on reported cases to determine efficacy, which are likely subject to reporting and testing biases. Early outbreak dynamics are also subject to a significant degree of stochastic uncertainty due to small numbers of cases. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> Here we use publicly-available mobility data and a stochastic branching process model to evaluate the efficacy of the cordon sanitaire to limiting the spread of COVID-19 from Wuhan to other cities in mainland China, while accounting for underreporting and uncertainty. We find that although travel restrictions led to a significant decrease in the number of individuals leaving Wuhan during the busy post-Lunar New Year holiday travel period, local transmission was likely already established in major cities. Thus, the travel restrictions likely did not affect the epidemic trajectory substantially in these cities. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> A cordon sanitaire around the epicentre alone may not be able to reduce COVID-19 incidence when implemented after local transmission has occurred in highly connected neighbors. Local non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce transmissibility (e.g., school and workplace closures) may have contributed more to the observed decrease in incidence in mainland China.",Quilty et al attempted to understand the effectiveness of inter-city travel restrictions on spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan.

Since the start of July, cases have increased, while deaths have continued to decrease. <h4>Methods</h4> We report results from 594,000 swabs tested for SARS-CoV-2 virus obtained from a representative sample of people in England over four rounds collected regardless of symptoms, starting in May 2020 and finishing at the beginning of September 2020. Swabs for the most recent two rounds were taken between 24th July and 11th August and for round 4 between 22nd August and 7th September. We estimate weighted overall prevalence, doubling times between and within rounds and associated reproduction numbers. We obtained unweighted prevalence estimates by sub-groups: age, sex, region, ethnicity, key worker status, household size, for which we also estimated odds of infection. We identified clusters of swab-positive participants who were closer, on average, to other swab-positive participants than would be expected. <h4>Findings</h4> Over all four rounds of the study, we found that 72% (67%, 76%) of swab-positive individuals were asymptomatic at the time of swab and in the week prior. The epidemic declined between rounds 1 and 2, and rounds 2 and 3. However, the epidemic was increasing between rounds 3 and 4, with a doubling time of 17 (13, 23) days corresponding to an R value of 1.3 (1.2, 1.4). When analysing round 3 alone, we found that the epidemic had started to grow again with 93% probability. Using only the most recent round 4 data, we estimated a doubling time of 7.7 (5.5, 12.7) days, corresponding to an R value of 1.7 (1.4, 2.0). Cycle threshold values were lower (viral loads were higher) for rounds 1 and 4 than they were for rounds 2 and 3. In round 4, we observed the highest prevalence in participants aged 18 to 24 years at 0.25% (0.16%, 0.41%), increasing from 0.08% (0.04%, 0.18%) in round 3. We observed the lowest prevalence in those aged 65 and older at 0.04% (0.02%, 0.06%) which was stable compared with round 3. Participants of Asian ethnicity had elevated odds of infection. We identified clusters in and around London, transient clusters in the Midlands, and an expanding area of clustering in the North West and more recently in Yorkshire and the Humber. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Although low levels of transmission persisted in England through to mid-summer 2020, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is now increasing. We found evidence of accelerating transmission at the end of August and beginning of September.

As the risk of contracting directly-transmitted infections depends on who interacts with whom, mathematical models often use contact matrices to characterise the spread of infectious pathogens. These contact matrices are usually generated from diary-based contact surveys. However, the majority of places in the world do not have representative empirical contact studies, so synthetic contact matrices have been constructed using more widely available setting-specific survey data on household, school, classroom, and workplace composition combined with empirical data on contact patterns in Europe. In 2017, the largest set of synthetic contact matrices to date were published for 152 geographical locations. In this study, we update these matrices with the most recent data and extend our analysis to 177 geographical locations. Due to the observed geographic differences within countries, we also quantify contact patterns in rural and urban settings where data is available. Further, we compare both the 2017 and 2020 synthetic matrices to out-of-sample empirically-constructed contact matrices, and explore the effects of using both the empirical and synthetic contact matrices when modelling physical distancing interventions for the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the synthetic contact matrices reproduce the main traits of the contact patterns in the empirically-constructed contact matrices. Models parameterised with the empirical and synthetic matrices generated similar findings with few differences observed in age groups where the empirical matrices have missing or aggregated age groups. This finding means that synthetic contact matrices may be used in modelling outbreaks in settings for which empirical studies have yet to be conducted. <h4>Author summary</h4> The risk of contracting a directly transmitted infectious disease such as the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) depends on who interacts with whom. Such person-to-person interactions vary by age and locations—e.g., at home, at work, at school, or in the community—due to the different social structures. These social structures, and thus contact patterns, vary across and within countries. Although social contact patterns can be measured using contact surveys, the majority of countries around the world, particularly low- and middle-income countries, lack nationally representative contact surveys. A simple way to present contact data is to use matrices where the elements represent the rate of contact between subgroups such as age groups represented by the columns and rows. In 2017, we generated age- and location-specific synthetic contact matrices for 152 geographical regions by adapting contact pattern data from eight European countries using country-specific data on household size, school and workplace composition. We have now updated these matrices with the most recent data (Demographic Household Surveys, World Bank, UN Population Division) extending the coverage to 177 geographical locations, covering 97.2% of the world’s population. We also quantified contact patterns in rural and urban settings. When compared to out-of-sample empirically-measured contact patterns, we found that the synthetic matrices reproduce the main features of these contact patterns.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/07/28/2020.07.22.20159772.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159772; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR191969; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR191969&type=FILE&fileName=EMS87995-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Similar associations were observed for 4-dose uptake, which was also delayed among care home residents. <h4>Conclusion</h4> Although high primary and booster dose coverage has been achieved among people with kidney disease in England, key disparities in vaccine uptake remain across demographic groups. Identifying how to address these disparities remains a priority to reduce the risk of severe disease in this vulnerable patient group.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/06/16/2022.06.14.22276391.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.14.22276391; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR507260; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR507260&type=FILE&fileName=EMS146125-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Pre-existing CVD, CV risk factors and associations with mortality and CV complications were ascertained. <h4>Findings</h4> Among 1,721 patients (median age 71 years, 57% male), 349 (20.3%) had pre-existing CVD (CVD), 888 (51.6%) had CV risk factors without CVD (RF-CVD), 484 (28.1%) had neither. Patients with CVD were older with a higher burden of non-CV comorbidities. During follow-up, 438 (25.5%) patients died: 37% with CVD, 25.7% with RF-CVD and 16.5% with neither. CVD was independently associated with in-hospital mortality among patients <70 years of age (adjusted HR 2.43 [95%CI 1.16-5.07]), but not in those ≥70 years (aHR 1.14 [95%CI 0.77-1.69]).

Most CV complications occurred in patients with CVD (66%) versus RF-CVD (17%) or neither (11%; p<0.001). 213 [12.4%] patients developed venous thromboembolism (VTE). CVD was not an independent predictor of VTE. <h4>Interpretation</h4> In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, pre-existing established CVD appears to be a more important contributor to mortality than CV risk factors in the absence of CVD.

As with any public health emergency, a major component of the global response is timely, effective science. However, particular factors specific to COVID-19 must be overcome to ensure that research efforts are optimised. We aimed to model the impact of COVID-19 on the clinical academic response in the UK, and to provide recommendations for COVID-related research. <h4>Methods</h4> We constructed a simple stochastic model to determine clinical academic capacity in the UK in four policy approaches to COVID-19 with differing population infection rates: “Italy model” (6%), “mitigation” (10%), “relaxed mitigation” (40%) and “do-nothing” (80%) scenarios. The ability to conduct research in the COVID-19 climate is affected by the following key factors: (i) infection growth rate and population infection rate (from UK COVID-19 statistics and WHO); (ii) strain on the healthcare system (from published model); and (iii) availability of clinical academic staff with appropriate skillsets affected by frontline clinical activity and sickness (from UK statistics). <h4>Findings</h4> In “Italy model”, “mitigation”, “relaxed mitigation” and “do-nothing” scenarios, from 5 March 2020 the duration (days) and peak infection rates (%) are 95(2.4%), 115(2.5%), 240(5.3%) and 240(16.7%) respectively. Near complete attrition of academia (87% reduction, <400 clinical academics) occurs 35 days after pandemic start for 11, 34, 62, 76 days respectively – with no clinical academics at all for 37 days in the “do-nothing” scenario. Restoration of normal academic workforce (80% of normal capacity) takes 11,12, 30 and 26 weeks respectively. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Pandemic COVID-19 crushes the science needed at system level. National policies mitigate, but the academic community needs to adapt. We highlight six key strategies: radical prioritisation (eg 3-4 research ideas per institution), deep resourcing, non-standard leadership (repurposing of key non-frontline teams), rationalisation (profoundly simple approaches), careful site selection (eg protected sites with large academic backup) and complete suspension of academic competition with collaborative approaches.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/04/17/2020.04.14.20065417.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.20065417; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR152293; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR152293&type=FILE&fileName=EMS90070-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

A conceptual framework and initial item pool were developed from published systematic reviews. Further concept elicitation and content validation was undertaken with adults with lived experience (n = 13) and clinicians (n = 10), and face validity was confirmed by the Therapies for Long COVID Study Patient and Public Involvement group (n = 25). The draft SBQ™-LC was field tested by adults with self-reported Long COVID recruited via social media and international Long COVID support groups (n = 274). Thematic analysis of interview and survey transcripts established content validity and informed construction of the draft questionnaire. Rasch analysis of field test data guided item and scale refinement and provided evidence of the final SBQ™-LC’s measurement properties. The Rasch-derived SBQ™-LC is composed of 17 independent scales with promising psychometric properties. Respondents rate symptom burden during the past 7-days using a dichotomous response or 4-point rating scale. Each scale provides coverage of a different symptom domain and returns a summed raw score that may be converted to a linear (0 – 100) score. Higher scores represent higher symptom burden. <h4>Conclusions</h4> The SBQ™-LC is a comprehensive patient-reported assessment of Long COVID symptom burden developed using modern psychometric methods.

Understanding the level of ascertainment (the ratio of confirmed symptomatic cases to the true number of symptomatic individuals) and undetected epidemic progression is crucial to informing COVID-19 response planning, including the introduction and relaxation of control measures. Estimating case ascertainment over time allows for accurate estimates of specific outcomes such as seroprevalence, which is essential for planning control measures. <h4>Methods</h4> Using reported data on COVID-19 cases and fatalities globally, we estimated the proportion of symptomatic cases (i.e. any person with any of fever >= 37.5°C, cough, shortness of breath, sudden onset of anosmia, ageusia or dysgeusia illness) that were reported in 210 countries and territories, given those countries had experienced more than ten deaths. We used published estimates of the baseline case fatality ratio (CFR), which was adjusted for delays and under-ascertainment, then calculated the ratio of this baseline CFR to an estimated local delay-adjusted CFR to estimate the level of under-ascertainment in a particular location. We then fit a Bayesian Gaussian process model to estimate the temporal pattern of under-ascertainment. <h4>Results</h4> Based on reported cases and deaths, we estimated that, during March 2020, the median percentage of symptomatic cases detected across the 84 countries which experienced more than ten deaths ranged from 2.4% (Bangladesh) to 100% (Chile). Across the ten countries with the highest number of total confirmed cases as of 6th July 2020, we estimated that the peak number of symptomatic cases ranged from 1.4 times (Chile) to 18 times (France) larger than reported. Comparing our model with national and regional seroprevalence data where available, we find that our estimates are consistent with observed values. Finally, we estimated seroprevalence for each country. As of the 7th June, our seroprevalence estimates range from 0% (many countries) to 13% (95% CrI: 5.6% – 24%) (Belgium). <h4>Conclusions</h4> We found substantial under-ascertainment of symptomatic cases, particularly at the peak of the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in many countries. Reported case counts will therefore likely underestimate the rate of outbreak growth initially and underestimate the decline in the later stages of an epidemic. Although there was considerable under-reporting in many locations, our estimates were consistent with emerging serological data, suggesting that the proportion of each country’s population infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide is generally low. <h4>Funding</h4> Wellcome Trust, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, DFID, NIHR, GCRF, ARC.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/09/22/2020.07.07.20148460.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.07.20148460; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR184933; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR184933&type=FILE&fileName=EMS87337-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Here we focus on the age-structured transmission within the population, using data from China to inform age-dependent susceptibility and synthetic age-mixing matrices to inform the contact network. This allows us to determine the country-specific basic reproductive ratio as a multiplicative scaling of the value from China.

We evaluated the health and economic impact of different age-based vaccine prioritisation strategies across this demographically and socio-economically diverse region. <h4>Methods</h4> We fitted country-specific age-stratified compartmental transmission models to reported COVID-19 mortality in the WHO European Region to inform the immunity level before vaccine roll-out. Building upon broad recommendations from the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (SAGE), we examined four strategies that prioritise: all adults (V+), younger (20-59 year-olds) followed by older adults (60+) (V20), older followed by younger adults (V60), and the oldest adults (75+) (V75) followed by incremental expansion to successively younger five-year age groups. We explored four roll-out scenarios based on projections or recent observations (R1-4) - the slowest scenario (R1) covers 30% of the total population by December 2022 and the fastest (R4) 80% by December 2021. Five decision-making metrics were summarised over 2021-22: mortality, morbidity, and losses in comorbidity-adjusted life expectancy (cLE), comorbidity- and quality-adjusted life years (cQALY), and the value of human capital (HC). Six sets of infection-blocking and disease-reducing vaccine efficacies were considered. <h4>Findings</h4> The optimal age-based vaccine prioritisation strategies were sensitive to country characteristics, decision-making metrics and roll-out speeds. Overall, V60 consistently performed better than or comparably to V75. There were greater benefits in prioritising older adults when roll-out is slow and when VE is low. Under faster roll-out, V+ was the most desirable option. <h4>Interpretation</h4> A prioritisation strategy involving more age-based stages (V75) does not necessarily lead to better health and economic outcomes than targeting broad age groups (V60). Countries expecting a slow vaccine roll-out may particularly benefit from prioritising older adults. <h4>Funding</h4> World Health Organization, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Medical Research Council (United Kingdom), the National Institute of Health Research (United Kingdom), the European Commission, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (United Kingdom), Wellcome Trust <h4>Research in Context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We searched PubMed and medRxiv for articles published in English from inception to 9 Jun 2021, with the search terms: (“COVID-19” OR “SARS-CoV-2”) AND (“priorit*) AND (“model*”) AND (“vaccin*”) and identified 66 studies on vaccine prioritization strategies. Of the 25 studies that compared two or more age-based prioritisation strategies, 12 found that targeting younger adults minimised infections while targeting older adults minimised mortality; an additional handful of studies found similar outcomes between different age-based prioritisation strategies where large outbreaks had already occurred. However, only two studies have explored age-based vaccine prioritisation using models calibrated to observed outbreaks in more than one country, and no study has explored the effectiveness of vaccine prioritisation strategies across settings with different population structures, contact patterns, and outbreak history. <h4>Added-value of this study</h4> We evaluated various age-based vaccine prioritisation strategies for 38 countries in the WHO European Region using various health and economic outcomes for decision-making, by parameterising models using observed outbreak history, known epidemiologic and vaccine characteristics, and a range of realistic vaccine roll-out scenarios. We showed that while targeting older adults was generally advantageous, broadly targeting everyone above 60 years might perform better than or comparably to a more detailed strategy that targeted the oldest age group above 75 years followed by those in the next younger five-year age band. Rapid vaccine roll-out has only been observed in a small number of countries. If vaccine coverage can reach 80% by the end of 2021, prioritising older adults may not be optimal in terms of health and economic impact. Lower vaccine efficacy was associated with greater relative benefits only under relatively slow roll-out scenarios considered. <h4>Implication of all the available evidence</h4> COVID-19 vaccine prioritization strategies that require more precise targeting of individuals of a specific and narrow age range may not necessarily lead to better outcomes compared to strategies that prioritise populations across broader age ranges. In the WHO European Region, prioritising all adults equally or younger adults first will only optimise health and economic impact when roll-out is rapid, which may raise between-country equity issues given the global demand for COVID-19 vaccines.",,doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.09.21260272; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR369660; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR369660&type=FILE&fileName=EMS130637-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We analyzed the following data from long-term participants in a decentralized multinational study: symptoms of depression, heart rate (HR) during the day and night; social activity; sedentary state, steps and physical activity of varying intensity. Linear mixed-effects regression analyses with repeated measures were fitted to assess the changes among three time periods (pre, during and post-lockdown) across the groups, adjusting for depression severity before the pandemic and gender. <h4>Results</h4> Participants with MDD (N=255) and MS (N=214) were included in the analyses. Overall, depressive symptoms remained stable across the three periods in both groups. Lower mean HR and HR variation were observed between pre and during lockdown during the day for MDD and during the night for MS.

Ideally, forecasts should be robust across time and locations. During the COVID-19 pandemic in England, it is an ongoing concern that demand for hospital care for COVID-19 patients in England will exceed available resources. <h4>Methods</h4> We made weekly forecasts of daily COVID-19 hospital admissions for National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in England between August 2020 and April 2021 using three disease-agnostic forecasting models: a mean ensemble of autoregressive time series models, a linear regression model with 7-day-lagged local cases as a predictor, and a scaled convolution of local cases and a delay distribution. We compared their point and probabilistic accuracy to a mean-ensemble of them all, and to a simple baseline model of no change from the last day of admissions. We measured predictive performance using the Weighted Interval Score (WIS) and considered how this changed in different scenarios (the length of the predictive horizon, the date on which the forecast was made, and by location), as well as how much admissions forecasts improved when future cases were known. <h4>Results</h4> All models outperformed the baseline in the majority of scenarios. Forecasting accuracy varied by forecast date and location, depending on the trajectory of the outbreak, and all individual models had instances where they were the top- or bottom-ranked model. Forecasts produced by the mean-ensemble were both the most accurate and most consistently accurate forecasts amongst all the models considered. Forecasting accuracy was improved when using future observed, rather than forecast, cases, especially at longer forecast horizons. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Assuming no change in current admissions is rarely better than including at least a trend. Using confirmed COVID-19 cases as a predictor can improve admissions forecasts in some scenarios, but this is variable and depends on the ability to make consistently good case forecasts. However, ensemble forecasts can make forecasts that make consistently more accurate forecasts across time and locations. Given minimal requirements on data and computation, our admissions forecasting ensemble could be used to anticipate healthcare needs in future epidemic or pandemic settings.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/01/19/2021.10.18.21265046.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.18.21265046; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR408531; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR408531&type=FILE&fileName=EMS137136-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Health systems in Africa and South Asia may be particularly at risk due to potential high prevalence of risk factors for severe disease, large household sizes and limited healthcare capacity. <h4>Methods</h4> We investigated the impact of an unmitigated COVID-19 epidemic on health system resources and costs, and household costs, in Karachi, Delhi, Nairobi, Addis Ababa and Johannesburg. We adapted a dynamic model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease to capture country-specific demography and contact patterns. The epidemiological model was then integrated into an economic framework that captured city-specific health systems and household resource use. <h4>Findings</h4> The cities severely lack intensive care beds, healthcare workers and financial resources to meet demand during an unmitigated COVID-19 epidemic. A highly mitigated COVID-19 epidemic, under optimistic assumptions, may avoid overwhelming hospital bed capacity in some cities, but not critical care capacity. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Viable mitigation strategies encompassing a mix of responses need to be established to expand healthcare capacity, reduce peak demand for healthcare resources, minimise progression to critical care and shield those at greatest risk of severe disease. <h4>Funding</h4> Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, European Commission, National Institute for Health Research, Department for International Development, Wellcome Trust, Royal Society, Research Councils UK. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We conducted a PubMed search on May 5, 2020, with no language restrictions, for studies published since inception, combining the terms (“cost” OR “economic”) AND “covid”. Our search yielded 331 articles, only two of which reported estimates of health system costs of COVID-19. The first study estimated resource use and medical costs for COVID-19 in the United States using a static model of COVID 19. The second study estimated the costs of polymerase chain reaction tests in the United States. We found no studies examining the economic implications of COVID-19 in low- or middle-income settings. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> This is the first study to use locally collected data in five cities (Karachi, Delhi, Nairobi, Addis Ababa and Johannesburg) to project the healthcare resource and health economic implications of an unmitigated COVID-19 epidemic. Besides the use of local data, our study moves beyond existing work to (i) consider the capacity of health systems in key cities to cope with this demand, (ii) consider healthcare staff resources needed, since these fall short of demand by greater margins than hospital beds, and (iii) consider economic costs to health services and households. <h4>Implications of all the evidence</h4> Demand for ICU beds and healthcare workers will exceed current capacity by orders of magnitude, but the capacity gap for general hospital beds is narrower. With optimistic assumptions about disease severity, the gap between demand and capacity for general hospital beds can be closed in some, but not all the cities. Efforts to bridge the economic burden of disease to households are needed.","The study aimed to mathmatically predict what the impact COVID-19 will be on hospitals and household income in cities in Africa and South Asia if measures are put in place to prevent the spread of infection, compared to no action.

The formula has not been updated since 2004 and lacks adjustments for clinical diagnoses, patient communication difficulties, and deprivation which are factors known to influence workload and health outcomes. In July 2021, Leicester, Leicestershire, and Rutland (LLR) Integrated Care Board introduced the Health Equity Payment (HEP), a top-up funding scheme based on a locally developed formula incorporating these additional factors. <h4>Method:</h4> We conducted a retrospective observational study using national public data to evaluate the impact of HEP between July 2021 and April 2023. Practices receiving HEP were matched to similar practices outside LLR using Genetic Matching on demographics, disease prevalence, and baseline outcomes. Seven outcomes were assessed: three patient experience measures from the GP Patient Survey, three staffing metrics (GP, nurse, and administrative full-time equivalents per 1000 weighted patients), and Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) achievement. Causal effects were estimated using doubly robust regression models with g-computation to estimate the average treatment effect. <h4>Results:</h4> Sixty-two LLR practices received HEP and were matched to 62 control practices. Practices receiving HEP achieved a 3.2 percentage point higher QOF score (95% CI: 0.5 to 5.9; p = 0.02) compared to controls. No statistically significant differences were found in patient experience or staffing outcomes. Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness to alternative time periods and outcome specifications but revealed sensitivity to missing staffing data from atypical practices. <h4>Discussion:</h4> This study provides the first causal evaluation of a capitation funding model incorporating clinical and sociodemographic factors in England. The modest improvement in QOF achievement suggests that targeted funding could be linked to enhanced care quality. The absence of effects on staffing and patient experience may reflect data limitations, short follow-up, or heterogeneity in how funds were used. These findings provide the the first evidence that locally tailored funding models could address inequalities in primary care provision and inform ongoing national reviews of the general practice capitation funding.</p>",,doi:https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-7509545/v1; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR1091472; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR1091472&type=FILE&fileName=EMS209240-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of azithromycin in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. <h4>Methods</h4> In this randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial, several possible treatments were compared with usual care in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated to either usual standard of care alone or usual standard of care plus azithromycin 500 mg once daily by mouth or intravenously for 10 days or until discharge (or one of the other treatment arms).

We then estimated associations between clinical and sociodemographic characteristics and rapid weight gain (>0.5kg/m 2 /year) using multivariable logistic regression. <h4>Results</h4> We extracted data on adults with T2D (n=1,231,455, 44% female, 76% white British) or hypertension (n=3,558,405, 50% female, 84% white British). Adults with T2D lost weight overall (median δ = -0.1kg/m 2 /year [IQR: -0.7, 0.4]), however, rapid weight gain was common (20.7%) and associated with sex (male vs female: aOR 0.78[95%CI 0.77, 0.79]); age, older age reduced odds (e.g. 60-69-year-olds vs 18-29-year-olds: aOR 0.66[0.61, 0.71]); deprivation, (least-deprived-IMD vs most-deprived-IMD: aOR 0.87[0.85, 0.89]); white ethnicity (Black vs White: aOR 0.70[0.69, 0.71]); mental health conditions (e.g. depression: aOR 1.13 [1.12, 1.15]); and diabetes treatment (non-insulin treatment vs no pharmacological treatment: aOR 0.68[0.67, 0.69]). Adults with hypertension maintained stable weight overall (median δ = 0.0kg/m 2 /year [-0.6, 0.5]), however, rapid weight gain was common (24.7%) and associated with similar characteristics as in T2D. <h4>Conclusion</h4> Amongst adults living in England with T2D and/or hypertension, rapid pandemic weight gain was more common amongst females, younger adults, those living in more deprived areas, and those with mental health conditions. <h4>How this fits in</h4> Previous studies, in the general population, have reported female sex, deprivation and comorbid mental health conditions increased risk of unhealthy weight gain during the pandemic, but it is not clear whether people living with hypertensions and/or type 2 diabetes experienced the same trends. We found that, during the pandemic, adults with hypertension maintained a stable weight whilst those with type 2 diabetes lost weight overall. However, underlying these overall trends, rapid weight gain was common amongst people with type 2 diabetes (20.7%) or hypertension (24.7%)), with female sex, younger age, deprivation, and comorbid mental health conditions associated with an increased odds of rapid weight gain in both populations.

We estimated associations between household composition and COVID-19 mortality in older adults (≥ 65 years) using a newly linked census-based dataset, and investigated whether living in a multi-generational household explained some of the elevated COVID-19 mortality amongst ethnic minority groups. <h4>Methods</h4> Using retrospective data from the 2011 Census linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (2017-2019) and death registration data (up to 27 th July 2020), we followed adults aged 65 years or over living in private households in England from 2 March 2020 until 27 July 2020 (n=10,078,568). We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for COVID-19 death for people living in a multi-generational household compared with people living with another older adult, adjusting for geographical factors, socio-economic characteristics and pre-pandemic health. We conducted a causal mediation analysis to estimate the proportion of ethnic inequalities explained by living in a multi-generational household. <h4>Results</h4> Living in a multi-generational household was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death. After adjusting for confounding factors, the HRs for living in a multi-generational household with dependent children were 1.13 [95% confidence interval 1.01-1.27] and 1.17 [1.01-1.35] for older males and females. The HRs for living in a multi-generational household without dependent children were 1.03 [0.97 - 1.09] for older males and 1.22 [1.12 - 1.32] for older females. Living in a multi-generational household explained between 10% and 15% of the elevated risk of COVID-19 death among older females from South Asian background, but very little for South Asian males or people in other ethnic minority groups. <h4>Conclusion</h4> Older adults living with younger people are at increased risk of COVID-19 mortality, and this is a notable contributing factor to the excess risk experienced by older South Asian females compared to White females.

Our aim is to estimate the health impact of COVID-19 vaccination alongside benefit-risk assessment of different dosing intervals for low- and middle-income countries of Europe. <h4>Methods</h4> We fitted a dynamic transmission model to country-level daily reported COVID-19 mortality in 13 low- and middle-income countries in the World Health Organization European Region (Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Georgia, Republic of Moldova, Russian Federation, Serbia, North Macedonia, Turkey, and Ukraine). A vaccine product with characteristics similar to the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 (AZD1222) vaccine was used in the base case scenario and was complemented by sensitivity analyses around efficacies related to other COVID-19 vaccines. Both fixed dosing intervals at 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks and dose-specific intervals that prioritise specific doses for certain age groups were tested. Optimal intervals minimise COVID-19 mortality between March 2021 and December 2022. We incorporated the emergence of variants of concern into the model, and also conducted a benefit-risk assessment to quantify the trade-off between health benefits versus adverse events following immunisation. <h4>Findings</h4> In 12 of the 13 countries, optimal strategies are those that prioritise the first doses among older adults (60+ years) or adults (20-59 years). These strategies lead to dosing intervals longer than six months. In comparison, a four-week fixed dosing interval may incur 10.2% [range: 4.0% - 22.5%; n = 13 (countries)] more deaths. There is generally a negative association between dosing interval and COVID-19 mortality within the range we investigated. Assuming a shorter first dose waning duration of 120 days, as opposed to 360 days in the base case, led to shorter optimal dosing intervals of 8-12 weeks. Benefit-risk ratios were the highest for fixed dosing intervals of 8-12 weeks. <h4>Interpretation</h4> We infer that longer dosing intervals of over six months, which are substantially longer than the current label recommendation for most vaccine products, could reduce COVID-19 mortality in low- and middle-income countries of WHO/Europe. Certain vaccine features, such as fast waning of first doses, significantly shorten the optimal dosing intervals. <h4>Funding</h4> World Health Organization",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/11/28/2021.11.27.21266930.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.27.21266930; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR425646; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR425646&type=FILE&fileName=EMS140311-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Serine protease TMPRSS2 is involved in priming the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for cellular entry through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the lung epithelium might have implications for risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of COVID-19. <h4>What this study adds</h4> We used human genetic variants that proxy ACE inhibitor drug effects and cardiometabolic risk factors to provide insight into how these exposures affect lung ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression and circulating ACE2 levels. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that ACE inhibitors have effects on ACE2 expression.

Professional societies have recommended changes in cancer service provision to minimize COVID-19 risks to cancer patients and health care workers. However, we do not know the extent to which cancer patients, in whom multi-morbidity is common, may be at higher overall risk of mortality as a net result of multiple factors including COVID-19 infection, changes in health services, and socioeconomic factors. <h4>Methods:</h4> We report multi-center, weekly cancer diagnostic referrals and chemotherapy treatments until April 2020 in England and Northern Ireland. We analyzed population-based health records from 3,862,012 adults in England to estimate 1-year mortality in 24 cancer sites and 15 non-cancer comorbidity clusters (40 conditions) recognized by CDC as high-risk. We estimated overall (direct and indirect) effects of COVID-19 emergency on mortality under different Relative Impact of the Emergency (RIE) and different Proportions of the population Affected by the Emergency (PAE). We applied the same model to the US, using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program data. <h4>Results:</h4> Weekly data until April 2020 demonstrate significant falls in admissions for chemotherapy (45-66% reduction) and urgent referrals for early cancer diagnosis (70-89% reduction), compared to pre-emergency levels. Under conservative assumptions of the emergency affecting only people with newly diagnosed cancer (incident cases) at COVID-19 PAE of 40%, and an RIE of 1.5, the model estimated 6,270 excess deaths at 1 year in England and 33,890 excess deaths in the US. In England, the proportion of patients with incident cancer with ≥1 comorbidity was 65.2%. The number of comorbidities was strongly associated with cancer mortality risk. Across a range of model assumptions, and across incident and prevalent cancer cases, 78% of excess deaths occur in cancer patients with ≥1 comorbidity. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> We provide the first estimates of potential excess mortality among people with cancer and multimorbidity due to the COVID-19 emergency and demonstrate dramatic changes in cancer services.

Anticoagulant prescribing decisions in atrial fibrillation (AF) offer a use case where the benchmark stroke risk prediction tool (CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc) could be meaningfully improved by including more information from a patient’s medical history. In this study, we design and build the first DL and ML pipeline that uses the routinely updated, linked EHR data for 56 million people in England accessed via NHS Digital to predict first ischaemic stroke in people with AF, and as a secondary outcome, COVID-19 death. Our pipeline improves first stroke prediction in AF by 17% compared to CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc (0.61 (0.57-0.65) vs 0.52 (0.52-0.52) area under the receiver operating characteristics curves, 95% confidence interval) and provides a generalisable, opensource framework that other researchers and developers can build on.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/12/21/2021.12.20.21268113.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.20.21268113; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR435234; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.20.21268113

Established in 2020, Born in Wales utilised data linkage techniques to connect information from the 2011 census with health, social care, and education routine data in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. We present the descriptive data available in the linked database, emphasise the robust data security and governance frameworks, and present the future expansion plans for the database beyond its initial development stage. <h4>Participants</h4> Descriptive information from 2011 to 2023 has been gathered from SAIL. This comprehensive dataset comprises over 400,000 child electronic records. To augment this data, the Born in Wales and primary school surveys have contributed quantitative and qualitative responses. <h4>Findings to date</h4> The cohort comprises all children born in Wales since 2011, with follow-up conducted until they finish primary school at age 11. 2,500 parents and 30,000 primary school children have been recruited for enhanced data collection and linkage to the data spine. The child cohort is 51%: 49% female: male, and 6% are from ethnic minority backgrounds. When considering age distribution, 26.8% of children are under the age of 5, while 63.2% fall within the age range of 5-11. <h4>Future plans</h4> Born in Wales will expand by 30,000 new births annually in Wales, while including follow-up data of children and parents already in the database. Supplementary datasets complement the existing linkage, including primary care, hospital data, educational attainment and social care. Future research includes exploring the long-term implications of COVID-19 on child health and development, the influence of environmental factors including climate change on health and examining the impact of parental work environment on child health and development. <h4>Strengths and limitations of this study</h4> Born in Wales has established a comprehensive, Wales-wide population-based database which consolidates clinical data from maternity, neonatal, child health, and education records. This national-scale database is supplemented by quantitative and qualitative results from surveys conducted by Born in Wales, providing rich insights into details that cannot be obtained through routinely collected data. The existence of this database enables further data linkage, facilitating life course research on the health and wellbeing of the Wales population. Missing data or errors in routine and administrative data may be constraint. A potential restriction of Born in Wales is the loss of data pertaining to individuals who relocate outside of Wales during pregnancy or after the child’s birth.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/06/15/2023.06.14.23291389.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.14.23291389; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR676615; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR676615&type=FILE&fileName=EMS177701-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Patients with missing sex or age were excluded, resulting in a population of 23,816,470 in January 2018, increasing to 25,541,940 by March 2023. <h4>Main outcome measures</h4> We calculated monthly counts and crude rates of GAS cases (sore throat/tonsillitis, scarlet fever, invasive group A strep) and prescriptions linked with a GAS case, before (pre-April 2020), during and after (post-April 2021) COVID-19 restrictions. We calculated the maximum and minimum count and rate for each season (years running September-August), and the rate ratio (RR) of the 2022/23 season to the last comparably high season (2017/18). <h4>Results</h4> Recording of GAS cases and antibiotic prescription linked with a GAS case peaked in December 2022, higher than the 2017/2018 peak. The peak rate of monthly sore throat/tonsillitis (possible group A strep throat) recording was 5.33 per 1,000 (RR 2022/23 versus 2017/18 1.39 (CI: 1.38 to 1.40)). Scarlet fever recording peaked at 0.51 per 1,000 (RR 2.68 (CI: 2.59 to 2.77)), and invasive group A streptococcal infection (iGAS) at 0.01 per 1,000 (RR 4.37 (CI: 2.94 to 6.48)). First line antibiotics with a record of a GAS infection peaked at 2.80 per 1,000 (RR 1.37 (CI:1.35 to 1.38)), alternative antibiotics at 2.03 per 1,000 (RR 2.30 (CI:2.26 to 2.34)), and reserved antibiotics at 0.09 per 1,000 (RR 2.42 (CI:2.24 to 2.61)). For individual antibiotics, azithromycin with GAS indication showed the greatest relative increase (RR 7.37 (CI:6.22 to 8.74)).This followed a sharp drop in recording of cases and associated prescriptions during the period of COVID-19 restrictions where the maximum count and rates were lower than any pre COVID-19 minimum. More detailed demographic breakdowns can be found in our regularly updated dashboard report. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Rates of scarlet fever, sore throat/tonsillitis and iGAS recording and associated antibiotic prescribing peaked in December 2022. Primary care data can supplement existing infectious disease surveillance through linkages with relevant prescribing data and detailed clinical and demographic subgroups. <h4>What is known</h4> During the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a substantial change to the pattern of circulating viruses and bacteria that cause illnesses. A spike in group A streptococcal infections in England starting December 2022 was associated with 426 deaths, including 48 children as of 7th May 2023. Increased demand for antibiotics in this period led to medicines shortages and the introduction of Serious Shortage Protocols (SSPs). Existing surveillance systems such as notifiable disease reports and GP in-hours surveillance bulletins describe clinical events, but they do not link to relevant prescribing data. <h4>What this study adds</h4> - This study supports the findings of routine surveillance reports which indicated a drop in GAS infections during the COVID-19 restrictions, followed by a spike in December 2022, demonstrating that the OpenSAFELY platform and primary care data can be used to rapidly describe not only clinical events but also relevant prescribing in the case of future outbreaks. - Antibiotic prescribing with a GAS indication, particularly for phenoxymethylpenicillin alternatives and reserved antibiotics, was higher in the December 2022 peak than in the 2017/2018 peak.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/10/03/2023.09.22.23295850.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.22.23295850; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR729805; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR729805&type=FILE&fileName=EMS188482-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

As the pandemic escalates, determining the resulting needs for healthcare resources (beds, staff, equipment) has become a key priority for many countries. Projecting future demand requires estimates of how long patients with COVID-19 need different levels of hospital care.  Methods We performed a systematic review to gather data on length of stay (LoS) of patients with COVID-19 in hospital and in ICU. We subsequently developed a method to generate LoS distributions which combines summary statistics reported in multiple studies, accounting for differences in sample sizes. Applying this approach we provide distributions for general hospital and ICU LoS from studies in China and elsewhere, for use by the community.  Results We identified 52 studies, the majority from China (46/52). Median hospital LoS ranged from 4 to 53 days within China, and 4 to 21 days outside of China, across 45 studies. ICU LoS was reported by eight studies - four each within and outside China - with median values ranging from 6 to 12 and 4 to 19 days, respectively. Our summary distributions have a median hospital LoS of 14 (IQR: 10-19) days for China, compared with 5 (IQR: 3-9) days outside of China. For ICU, the summary distributions are more similar (median (IQR) of 8 (5-13) days for China and 7 (4-11) days outside of China). There was a visible difference by discharge status, with patients who were discharged alive having longer LoS than those who died during their admission, but no trend associated with study date. Conclusion Patients with COVID-19 in China appeared to remain in hospital for longer than elsewhere. This may be explained by differences in criteria for admission and discharge between countries, and different timing within the pandemic. In the absence of local data, the combined summary LoS distributions provided here can be used to model bed demands for contingency planning and then updated, with the novel method presented here, as more studies with aggregated statistics emerge outside China.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/05/17/2020.04.30.20084780.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.30.20084780; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR158572; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR158572&type=FILE&fileName=EMS91902-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Here, we characterize the time-dependent progression of COVID-19 through different stages of the disease, by measuring 86 accredited diagnostic parameters and plasma proteomes at 687 sampling points, in a cohort of 139 patients during hospitalization. We report that the time-resolved patient molecular phenotypes reflect an initial spike in the systemic inflammatory response, which is gradually alleviated and followed by a protein signature indicative of tissue repair, metabolic reconstitution and immunomodulation. Further, we show that the early host response is predictive for the disease trajectory and gives rise to proteomic and diagnostic marker signatures that classify the need for supplemental oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation, and that predict the time to recovery of mildly ill patients. In severely ill patients, the molecular phenotype of the early host response predicts survival, in two independent cohorts and weeks before outcome.

Corresponding HRs for BNT162b2 were 0.81 (0.74–0.88) and 0.57 (0.53–0.62) for venous thromboses, and 0.94 (0.90-0.99) and 0.72 (0.70-0.75) for arterial thromboses. HRs for thrombotic events were higher at younger ages for venous thromboses after ChAdOx1-S, and for arterial thromboses after both vaccines. Rates of intracranial venous thrombosis (ICVT) and thrombocytopenia in adults aged <70 years were higher 1-28 days after ChAdOx1-S (adjusted HRs 2.27, 95% CI:1.33– 3.88 and 1.71, 1.35–2.16 respectively), but not after BNT162b2 (0.59, 0.24–1.45 and 1.00, 0.75–1.34) compared with unvaccinated. The corresponding absolute excess risks of ICVT 1-28 days after ChAdOx1-S were 0.9–3 per million, varying by age and sex. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Increases in ICVT and thrombocytopenia after ChAdOx1-S vaccination in adults aged <70 years were small compared with its effect in reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, although more precise estimates for adults <40 years are needed. For people aged ≥70 years, rates of arterial or venous thrombotic, events were generally lower after either vaccine.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/01/14/2021.08.18.21262222.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.18.21262222; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR387421; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR387421&type=FILE&fileName=EMS134400-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

To maximise the potential of Germ Defence to effectively reduce the spread of COVID-19 the intervention needed to be implemented at scale rapidly. <bold>Methods:</bold> With the approval of NHS England, we implemented an efficient two-arm (1:1 ratio) cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effectiveness of randomising implementation of Germ Defence via GP practices across England, UK, compared with usual care. GP practices randomised to the intervention arm (n=3292) were emailed and asked to disseminate the Germ Defence intervention to all adult patients via mobile phone text, email or social media. GP practices randomised to the usual care arm (n=3287) maintained standard management for the 4-month trial period after and then asked to share Germ Defence with their adult patients. The primary outcome was the rate of GP presentations for respiratory tract infections (RTI) per patient. Secondary outcomes comprised rates of acute RTIs, confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses, suspected COVID-19 diagnoses, COVID-19 symptoms, gastrointestinal infection diagnoses, antibiotic usage, hospital admissions. The impact of the intervention on outcome rates was assessed using negative binomial regression modelling within the OpenSAFELY platform. The uptake of intervention by GP practice, and by patients were measured via website analytics. <bold>Results:</bold> Germ Defence was used 310,731 times. The average satisfaction score after using the website was 7.52 (0-10 not at all to very satisfied, N = 9933). There was no evidence of a difference in the rate of RTIs between intervention and control practices (rate ratio (RR) 1.01, 95%CI 0.96, 1.06, p=0.70). This was similar to all other eight health outcomes. Patient engagement within intervention arm practices ranged from 0- 48% of a practice list.

The aim of this study was to derive and validate risk prediction models for poor outcome and death in adult inpatients with COVID-19.     <br><br>Methods: Model derivation using data from Wuhan, China used logistic regression with death and poor outcome (death or severe disease) as outcomes. Predictors were demographic, comorbidity, symptom and laboratory test variables. The best performing models were externally validated in data from London, UK.     <br><br>Findings: 4.3% of the derivation cohort (n=775) died and 9.7% had a poor outcome, compared to 34.1% and 42.9% of the validation cohort (n=226). In derivation, prediction models based on age, sex, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, platelet count, C-reactive protein and creatinine had excellent discrimination (death c-index=0.91, poor outcome c-index=0.88), with good-to-excellent calibration. Using two cut-offs to define low, high and very-high risk groups, derivation patients were stratified in groups with observed death rates of 0.34%, 15.0% and 28.3% and poor outcome rates 0.63%, 8.9% and 58.5%.

This study describes variation in vaccination coverage by sociodemographic characteristics between December 2020 and August 2021. <h4>Methods</h4> Using population-level administrative records linked to the 2011 Census, we estimated monthly first dose vaccination rates by age group and sociodemographic characteristics amongst adults aged 18 years or over in England. We also present a tool to display the results interactively. <h4>Findings</h4> Our study population included 35,223,466 adults. A lower percentage of males than females were vaccinated in the young and middle age groups (18-59 years) but not in the older age groups. Vaccination rates were highest among individuals of White British and Indian ethnic backgrounds and lowest among Black Africans (aged ≥80 years) and Black Caribbeans (18-79 years). Differences by ethnic group emerged as soon as vaccination roll-out commenced and widened over time. Vaccination rates were also lower among individuals who identified as Muslim, lived in more deprived areas, reported having a disability, did not speak English as their main language, lived in rented housing, belonged to a lower socio-economic group, and had fewer qualifications. <h4>Interpretation</h4> We found inequalities in COVID-19 vaccination rates by sex, ethnicity, religion, area deprivation, disability status, English language proficiency, socio-economic position, and educational attainment, but some of these differences varied by age group. Research is urgently needed to understand why these inequalities exist and how they can be addressed. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We searched PubMed for publications on sociodemographic inequalities in COVID-19 vaccination coverage. Several studies have reported differences in coverage by characteristics such as ethnicity and religion, however these have focused on older adults and the clinically vulnerable who were initially prioritized for vaccination. There is little evidence on sociodemographic inequalities in vaccination coverage among younger adults and evidence is also lacking on coverage by a wider range of characteristics such as sex, disability status, English language proficiency, socio-economic position, and educational attainment. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> This study provides the first evidence for sociodemographic inequalities in COVID-19 vaccination coverage among the entire adult population in England, using population-level administrative records linked to the 2011 Census. By disaggregating the data by age group, we were able to show that disparities in coverage by some sociodemographic characteristics differed by age group. For example, a lower proportion of males than females were vaccinated in the young and middle age groups (18-59 years) but not in the older age groups, and vaccination rates were lowest among Black Africans in those aged ≥80 years but lowest among Black Caribbeans for all other age groups. Vaccination rates were also lower among individuals who identified as Muslim, lived in more deprived areas, reported having a disability, did not speak English as their main language, lived in rented housing, belonged to a lower socio-economic group, and had fewer qualifications. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Many of the groups with the lowest rates of COVID-19 vaccination are also the groups that have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, including severe illness and mortality. Research is urgently needed to understand why these disparities exist and how they can be addressed, for example through public health or community engagement programmes. Since the relationships between sociodemographic characteristics and vaccination coverage may differ by age group, it is important for future research to disaggregate by age group when examining these inequalities.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/10/07/2021.10.07.21264681.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.07.21264681; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR404742; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR404742&type=FILE&fileName=EMS136793-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

This study aimed to estimate the theoretical cost-optimal capacity requirement for ‘step down’ intermediate care services within a major healthcare system in England, at a time when considerable uncertainty remained regarding vaccination uptake and the easing of societal restrictions. <h4>Methods</h4> Demand for intermediate care was projected using an epidemiological model (for COVID-19 demand) and regressing upon public mobility (for non-COVID-19 demand). These were inputted to a computer simulation model of patient flow from acute discharge readiness to bedded and home-based Discharge to Assess (D2A) intermediate care services. Cost-optimal capacity was defined as that which yielded the lowest total cost of intermediate care provision and corresponding acute discharge delays. <h4>Results</h4> Increased intermediate care capacity is likely to bring about lower system-level costs, with the additional D2A investment more than offset by substantial reductions in costly acute discharge delays (leading also to improved patient outcome and experience). Results suggest that completely eliminating acute ‘bed blocking’ is unlikely economical (requiring large amounts of downstream capacity), and that health systems should instead target an appropriate tolerance based upon the specific characteristics of the pathway. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Computer modelling can be a valuable asset for determining optimal capacity allocation along the complex care pathway. With results supporting a Business Case for increased downstream capacity, this study demonstrates how modelling can be applied in practice and provides a blueprint for use alongside the freely-available model code.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/10/26/2021.10.25.21265475.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.25.21265475; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR411876; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR411876&type=FILE&fileName=EMS137621-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We defined households by number of generations living together, and used multivariable Cox regression stratified by location and wave of the pandemic and accounted for age, sex, comorbidities, smoking, obesity, housing density and deprivation. We included 2 692 223 people over 67 years in wave 1 (01/02/2020-31/08/2020) and 2 731 427 in wave 2 (01/09/2020-31/01/2021). Multigenerational living was associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19 for White and South Asian older people in both waves (e.g. wave 2, 67+ living with 3 other generations vs 67+ year olds only: White HR 1·61 95% CI 1·38-1·87, South Asian HR 1·76 95% CI 1·48-2·10), with a trend for increased risks of severe COVID-19 with increasing generations in wave 2. Multigenerational living was associated with severe COVID-19 in older adults. Older South Asian people are over-represented within multigenerational households in England, especially in the most deprived settings.

Shielding was intended to protect those at highest risk of serious harm from COVID-19. We report the cost of implementing shielding in Wales. <h4>Methods:</h4> The number of people shielding was extracted from the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank. Resources supporting shielding between March and June 2020 were mapped using published reports, web pages, freedom of information requests to Welsh Government and personal communications (e.g. the office of the Chief Medical Officer for Wales). <h4>Results:</h4> At the beginning of shielding, 117,415 people were on the shielding list. The total additional cost to support those advised to stay home during the initial 14 weeks of the pandemic was £13,307,654 (£113 per person shielded). This included the new resources required to compile the shielding list, inform CEV people of the shielding intervention and provide medicine and food deliveries. The list was adjusted weekly over the 3-month period (130,000 people identified by June 2020) therefore the cost per person shielded lies between £102 and £113. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> This is the first evaluation of the cost of the measures put in place to support those identified to shield in Wales. However, no data on opportunity cost was available. The true cost of shielding including its budget impact and opportunity costs need to be investigated to decide whether shielding is a worthwhile policy for future health emergencies.",,pdf:https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2573712/latest.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2573712/v1; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR626309; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR626309&type=FILE&fileName=EMS171864-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Medication reviews are an important primary care activity to ensure safety and appropriateness of ongoing prescribing and a disruption could have significant negative implications for patient care. <h4>Aim</h4> Using routinely collected data, our aim was to i) describe the SNOMED CT codes used to report medication review activity ii) report the impact of COVID-19 on the volume and variation of medication reviews. <h4>Design and setting</h4> With the approval of NHS England, we conducted a cohort study of 20 million adult patient records in general practice, in-situ using the OpenSAFELY platform. <h4>Method</h4> For each month between April 2019 - March 2022, we report the percentage of patients with a medication review coded monthly and in the previous 12 months. These measures were broken down by regional, clinical and demographic subgroups and amongst those prescribed high risk medications. <h4>Results</h4> In April 2019, 32.3% of patients had a medication review coded in the previous 12 months.

We evaluated strategies to reduce SARS-CoV-2 burden in African countries, so as to support decisions that balance minimising mortality, protecting health services and safeguarding livelihoods. <h4>Methods</h4> We used a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered mathematical model, stratified by age, to predict the evolution of COVID-19 epidemics in three countries representing a range of age distributions in Africa (from oldest to youngest average age: Mauritius, Nigeria and Niger), under various effectiveness assumptions for combinations of different non-pharmaceutical interventions: self-isolation of symptomatic people, physical distancing, and ‘shielding’ (physical isolation) of the high-risk population. We adapted model parameters to better represent uncertainty about what might be expected in African populations, in particular by shifting the distribution of severity risk towards younger ages and increasing the case-fatality ratio. <h4>Results</h4> We predicted median clinical attack rates over the first 12 months of 17% (Niger) to 39% (Mauritius), peaking at 2–4 months, if epidemics were unmitigated. Self-isolation while symptomatic had a maximum impact of about 30% on reducing severe cases, while the impact of physical distancing varied widely depending on percent contact reduction and R 0 . The effect of shielding high-risk people, e.g. by rehousing them in physical isolation, was sensitive mainly to residual contact with low-risk people, and to a lesser extent to contact among shielded individuals. Response strategies incorporating self-isolation of symptomatic individuals, moderate physical distancing and high uptake of shielding reduced predicted peak bed demand by 46% to 54% and mortality by 60% to 75%. Lockdowns delayed epidemics by about 3 months. Estimates were sensitive to differences in age-specific social mixing patterns, as published in the literature. <h4>Discussion</h4> In African settings, as elsewhere, current evidence suggests large COVID-19 epidemics are expected. However, African countries have fewer means to suppress transmission and manage cases. We found that self-isolation of symptomatic persons and general physical distancing are unlikely to avert very large epidemics, unless distancing takes the form of stringent lockdown measures. However, both interventions help to mitigate the epidemic. Shielding of high-risk individuals can reduce health service demand and, even more markedly, mortality if it features high uptake and low contact of shielded and unshielded people, with no increase in contact among shielded people. Strategies combining self-isolation, moderate physical distancing and shielding will probably achieve substantial reductions in mortality in African countries. Temporary lockdowns, where socioeconomically acceptable, can help gain crucial time for planning and expanding health service capacity.","Zandvoort et al. used mathematical modelling and simulation methods to predict the impact of various control scenarios on outcome of COVID-19 epidemics in three African countries. They’ve shown that mixed strategies, including moderate physical distancing and shielding are more likely to achieve substantial reductions in mortality in African countries.

Mass vaccination has offered a route to reduce societal restrictions while protecting hospitals from being overwhelmed. Yet, early in the mass vaccination effort, the possible effect on future bed pressures remained subject to considerable uncertainty. This paper provides an account of how, in one healthcare system, operational decision-making and bed planning was supported through modelling the effect of a range of vaccination scenarios on future COVID-19 admissions. <h4>Methods</h4> An epidemiological model of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) type was fitted to local data for the one-million resident healthcare system located in South West England. Model parameters and vaccination scenarios were calibrated through a system-wide multi-disciplinary working group, comprising public health intelligence specialists, healthcare planners, epidemiologists, and academics. From 4 March 2021 (the time of the study), scenarios assumed incremental relaxations to societal restrictions according to the envisaged UK Government timeline, with all restrictions to be removed by 21 June 2021. <h4>Results</h4> Achieving 95% vaccine uptake in adults by 31 July 2021 would not avert a third wave in autumn 2021 but would produce a median peak bed requirement approximately 6% (IQR: 1% to 24%) of that experienced during the second wave (January 2021). A two-month delay in vaccine rollout would lead to significantly higher peak bed occupancy, at 66% (11% to 146%) of that of the second wave. If only 75% uptake was achieved (the amount typically associated with vaccination campaigns) then the second wave peak for acute and intensive care beds would be exceeded by 4% and 19% respectively, an amount which would seriously pressure hospital capacity. <h4>Conclusion</h4> Modelling provided support to senior managers in setting the number of acute and intensive care beds to make available for COVID-19 patients, as well as highlighting the importance of public health in promoting high vaccine uptake among the population. Forecast accuracy has since been supported by actual data collected following the analysis, with observed peak bed occupancy falling comfortably within the inter-quartile range of modelled projections.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/10/13/2021.10.10.21264821.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.10.21264821; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR406625; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR406625&type=FILE&fileName=EMS136883-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

The aim of this study was to derive and validate risk prediction models for poor outcome and death in adult inpatients with COVID-19. <h4>Methods</h4> Model derivation using data from Wuhan, China used logistic regression with death and poor outcome (death or severe disease) as outcomes. Predictors were demographic, comorbidity, symptom and laboratory test variables. The best performing models were externally validated in data from London, UK. <h4>Findings</h4> 4.3% of the derivation cohort (n=775) died and 9.7% had a poor outcome, compared to 34.1% and 42.9% of the validation cohort (n=226). In derivation, prediction models based on age, sex, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, platelet count, C-reactive protein and creatinine had excellent discrimination (death c-index=0.91, poor outcome c-index=0.88), with good-to-excellent calibration. Using two cut-offs to define low, high and very-high risk groups, derivation patients were stratified in groups with observed death rates of 0.34%, 15.0% and 28.3% and poor outcome rates 0.63%, 8.9% and 58.5%. External validation discrimination was good (c-index death=0.74, poor outcome=0.72) as was calibration. However, observed rates of death were 16.5%, 42.9% and 58.4% and poor outcome 26.3%, 28.4% and 64.8% in predicted low, high and very-high risk groups. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Our prediction model using demography and routinely-available laboratory tests performed very well in internal validation in the lower-risk derivation population, but less well in the much higher-risk external validation population. Further external validation is needed. Collaboration to create larger derivation datasets, and to rapidly externally validate all proposed prediction models in a range of populations is needed, before routine implementation of any risk prediction tool in clinical care. <h4>Funding</h4> MRC, Wellcome Trust, HDR-UK, LifeArc, participating hospitals, NNSFC, National Key R&D Program, Pudong Health and Family Planning Commission <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> Several prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to severe disease, or length of hospital stay in COVID-19 have been published. 1 Commonly reported predictors of severe prognosis in patients with COVID-19 include age, sex, computed tomography scan features, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactic dehydrogenase, and lymphocyte count. Symptoms (notably dyspnoea) and comorbidities (e.g. chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease and hypertension) are also reported to have associations with poor prognosis. 2 However, most studies have not described the study population or intended use of prediction models, and external validation is rare and to date done using datasets originating from different Wuhan hospitals. 3 Given different patterns of testing and organisation of healthcare pathways, external validation in datasets from other countries is required. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> This study used data from Wuhan, China to derive and internally validate multivariable models to predict poor outcome and death in COVID-19 patients after hospital admission, with external validation using data from King’s College Hospital, London, UK. Mortality and poor outcome occurred in 4.3% and 9.7% of patients in Wuhan, compared to 34.1% and 42.9% of patients in London. Models based on age, sex and simple routinely available laboratory tests (lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, platelet count, CRP and creatinine) had good discrimination and calibration in internal validation, but performed only moderately well in external validation. Models based on age, sex, symptoms and comorbidity were adequate in internal validation for poor outcome (ICU admission or death) but had poor performance for death alone. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> This study and others find that relatively simple risk prediction models using demographic, clinical and laboratory data perform well in internal validation but at best moderately in external validation, either because derivation and external validation populations are small (Xie et al 3 ) and/or because they vary greatly in casemix and severity (our study). There are three decision points where risk prediction may be most useful: (1) deciding who to test; (2) deciding which patients in the community are at high-risk of poor outcomes; and (3) identifying patients at high-risk at the point of hospital admission. Larger studies focusing on particular decision points, with rapid external validation in multiple datasets are needed. A key gap is risk prediction tools for use in community triage (decisions to admit, or to keep at home with varying intensities of follow-up including telemonitoring) or in low income settings where laboratory tests may not be routinely available at the point of decision-making. This requires systematic data collection in community and low-income settings to derive and evaluate appropriate models.","The paper utilises a model created on Wuhan data to identify outcomes. The model was validated on London data but this population was higher risk, so was not very comparable.

There is a need to optimize allocation of treatment and resources in intensive care, as clinically established risk assessments such as SOFA and APACHE II scores show only limited performance for predicting the survival of severely ill COVID-19 patients. Comprehensively capturing the host physiology, we speculated that proteomics in combination with new data-driven analysis strategies could produce a new generation of prognostic discriminators. We studied two independent cohorts of patients with severe COVID-19 who required intensive care and invasive mechanical ventilation. SOFA score, Charlson comorbidity index and APACHE II score were poor predictors of survival. Plasma proteomics instead identified 14 proteins that showed concentration trajectories different between survivors and non-survivors. A proteomic predictor trained on single samples obtained at the first time point at maximum treatment level (i.e. WHO grade 7) and weeks before the outcome, achieved accurate classification of survivors in an exploratory (AUROC 0.81) as well as in the independent validation cohort (AUROC of 1.0). The majority of proteins with high relevance in the prediction model belong to the coagulation system and complement cascade.

It is not known if the new variant presents with variation in symptoms or disease course, if previously infected individuals may become reinfected with the new variant, or how the variant’s increased transmissibility affects measures to reduce its spread. <h4>Methods</h4> Using longitudinal symptom reports from 36,920 users of the COVID Symptom Study app testing positive for Covid-19 between 28 September and 27 December 2020, we performed an ecological study to examine the association between the regional proportion of B.1.1.7 and reported symptoms, disease course, rates of reinfection, and transmissibility. <h4>Findings</h4> We found no evidence for changes in reported symptoms or disease duration associated with B.1.1.7. We found a likely reinfection rate of 0.7% (95% CI 0.6-0.8), but no evidence that this was higher compared to older strains. We found an increase in R(t) by a factor of 1.35 (95% CI 1.02-1.69). Despite this, we found that R(t) fell below 1 during regional and national lockdowns, even in regions with high proportions of B.1.1.7. <h4>Interpretation</h4> The lack of change in symptoms indicates existing testing and surveillance infrastructure do not need to change specifically for the new variant, and the reinfection findings suggest that vaccines are likely to remain effective against the new variant. <h4>Funding</h4> Zoe Global Limited, Department of Health, Wellcome Trust, EPSRC, NIHR, MRC, Alzheimer’s Society. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> To identify existing evidence on SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 we searched PubMed and Google Scholar for articles between 1 December 2020 and 1 February 2021 using the keywords Covid-19 AND B.1.1.7, finding 281 results. We did not find any studies that investigated B.1.1.7-associated changes in the symptoms experienced, their severity and duration, but found one study showing B.1.1.7 did not change the ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic infections. We found six articles describing laboratory-based investigations of the responses of B.1.1.7 to vaccine-induced immunity to B.1.1.7, but no work investigating what this means for natural immunity and the likelihood of reinfection outside of the lab. We found five articles demonstrating the increased transmissibility of B.1.1.7. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore changes in symptom type and duration, as well as community reinfection rates, associated with B.1.1.7. The work uses self-reported symptom logs from 36,920 users of the COVID Symptom Study app reporting positive test results between 28 September and 27 December 2020. We find that B.1.1.7 is not associated with changes in the symptoms experienced in Covid-19, nor their duration. Building on existing lab studies, our work suggests that natural immunity developed from previous infection provides similar levels of protection to B.1.1.7. We add to the emerging consensus that B.1.1.7 exhibits increased transmissibility. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Our findings suggest that existing criteria for obtaining a Covid-19 test in the community need not change for the rise of B.1.1.7. The fact that immunity developed from infection by wild type variants protects against B.1.1.7 provides an indication that vaccines will remain effective against B.1.1.7.

Projecting the size of an unmitigated epidemic and the potential effect of different control measures has been critical to support evidence-based policymaking during the early stages of the epidemic. <h4>Methods</h4> We used a stochastic age-structured transmission model to explore a range of intervention scenarios, including the introduction of school closures, social distancing, shielding of elderly groups, self-isolation of symptomatic cases, and extreme “lockdown”-type restrictions. We simulated different durations of interventions and triggers for introduction, as well as combinations of interventions. For each scenario, we projected estimated new cases over time, patients requiring inpatient and critical care (intensive care unit, ICU) treatment, and deaths. <h4>Findings</h4> We found that mitigation measures aimed at reducing transmission would likely have decreased the reproduction number, but not sufficiently to prevent ICU demand from exceeding NHS availability. To keep ICU bed demand below capacity in the model, more extreme restrictions were necessary. In a scenario where “lockdown”-type interventions were put in place to reduce transmission, these interventions would need to be in place for a large proportion of the coming year in order to prevent healthcare demand exceeding availability. <h4>Interpretation</h4> The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 mean that extreme measures are likely required to bring the epidemic under control and to prevent very large numbers of deaths and an excess of demand on hospital beds, especially those in ICUs. <h4>Research in Context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> As countries have moved from early containment efforts to planning for the introduction of large-scale non-pharmaceutical interventions to control COVID-19 outbreaks, epidemic modelling studies have explored the potential for extensive social distancing measures to curb transmission. However, it remains unclear how different combinations of interventions, timings, and triggers for the introduction and lifting of control measures may affect the impact of the epidemic on health services, and what the range of uncertainty associated with these estimates would be. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> Using a stochastic, age-structured epidemic model, we explored how eight different intervention scenarios could influence the number of new cases and deaths, as well as intensive care beds required over the projected course of the epidemic. We also assessed the potential impact of local versus national targeting of interventions, reduction in leisure events, impact of increased childcare by grandparents, and timing of triggers for different control measures. We simulated multiple realisations for each scenario to reflect uncertainty in possible epidemic trajectories. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Our results support early modelling findings, and subsequent empirical observations, that in the absence of control measures, a COVID-19 epidemic could quickly overwhelm a healthcare system. We found that even a combination of moderate interventions – such as school closures, shielding of older groups and self-isolation – would be unlikely to prevent an epidemic that would far exceed available ICU capacity in the UK. Intermittent periods of more intensive lockdown-type measures are predicted to be effective for preventing the healthcare system from being overwhelmed.","It is highly important to know the outcome of different scenarios ahead of critical decisions.

UK-REACH (United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity and COVID-19 outcomes) is a large-scale study of COVID-19 in UK HCWs from diverse ethnic backgrounds, which includes measures of vaccine hesitancy. The present study explores predictors of vaccine hesitancy using a ‘phenomic approach’, considering several hundred questionnaire-based measures. <h4>Methods</h4> UK-REACH includes a questionnaire study encompassing 12,431 HCWs who were recruited from December 2020 to March 2021 and completed a lengthy online questionnaire (785 raw items; 392 derived measures; 260 final measures). Ethnicity was classified using the Office for National Statistics’ five (ONS5) and eighteen (ONS18) categories. Missing data were handled by multiple imputation. Variable selection used the islasso package in R , which provides standard errors so that results from imputations could be combined using Rubin’s rules. The data were modelled using path analysis, so that predictors, and predictors of predictors could be assessed. Significance testing used the Bayesian approach of Kass and Raftery, a ‘very strong’ Bayes Factor of 150, N=12,431, and a Bonferroni correction giving a criterion of p<4.02 × 10 −8 for the main regression, and p<3.11 × 10 −10 for variables in the path analysis. <h4>Results</h4> At the first step of the phenomic analysis, six variables were direct predictors of greater vaccine hesitancy: Lower pro-vaccination attitudes; no flu vaccination in 2019-20; pregnancy; higher COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs; younger age; and lower optimism the roll-out of population vaccination. Overall 44 lower variables in total were direct or indirect predictors of hesitancy, with the remaining 215 variables in the phenomic analysis not independently predicting vaccine hesitancy. Key variables for predicting hesitancy were belief in conspiracy theories of COVID-19 infection, and a low belief in vaccines in general. Conspiracy beliefs had two main sets of influences: Higher Fatalism, which was influenced a) by high external and chance locus of control and higher need for closure, which in turn were associated with neuroticism, conscientiousness, extraversion and agreeableness; and b) by religion being important in everyday life, and being Muslim. receiving information via social media, not having higher education, and perceiving greater risks to self, the latter being influenced by higher concerns about spreading COVID, greater exposure to COVID-19, and financial concerns. There were indirect effects of ethnicity, mediated by religion. Religion was more important for Pakistani and African HCWs, and less important for White and Chinese groups. Lower age had a direct effect on hesitancy, and age and female sex also had several indirect effects on hesitancy. <h4>Conclusions</h4> The phenomic approach, coupled with a path analysis revealed a complex network of social, cognitive, and behavioural influences on SARS-Cov-2 vaccine hesitancy from 44 measures, 6 direct and 38 indirect, with the remaining 215 measures not having direct or indirect effects on hesitancy. It is likely that issues of trust underpin many associations with hesitancy. Understanding such a network of influences may help in tailoring interventions to address vaccine concerns and facilitate uptake in more hesistant groups. <h4>Funding</h4> UKMRI-MRC and NIHR",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/12/09/2021.12.08.21267421.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.08.21267421; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR430732; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR430732&type=FILE&fileName=EMS141669-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

As governments begin to relax restrictions on public life there is a need to understand the potential impact that reopening schools may have on transmission. <h4>Methods</h4> We used data provided by the UK Department for Education to construct a network of English schools, connected through pairs of pupils resident at the same address. We used the network to evaluate the potential for transmission between schools, and for long range propagation across the network, under different reopening scenarios. <h4>Results</h4> Amongst the options evaluated we found that reopening only Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 (4-6 and 10-11 year olds) resulted in the lowest risk of transmission between schools, with outbreaks within a single school unlikely to result in outbreaks in adjacent schools in the network. The additional reopening of Years 10 and 12 (14-15 and 16-17 year olds) resulted in an increase in the risk of transmission between schools comparable to reopening all primary school years (4-11 year olds). However, the majority of schools presented low risk of initiating widespread transmission through the school system. Reopening all secondary school years (11-18 year olds) resulted in large potential outbreak clusters putting up to 50% of households connected to schools at risk of infection if sustained transmission within schools was possible. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Reopening secondary school years is likely to have a greater impact on community transmission than reopening primary schools in England.

However, it is not clear to what extent these measures explain the low numbers of recorded COVID-19 cases and deaths in Africa. One of the main aims of control measures is to reduce respiratory pathogen transmission through direct contact with others. In this study we collect contact data from residents of informal settlements around Nairobi, Kenya to assess if control measures have changed contact patterns, and estimate the impact of changes on the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ). <h4>Methods</h4> We conducted a social contact survey with 213 residents of five informal settlements around Nairobi in early May 2020, four weeks after the Kenyan government introduced enhanced physical distancing measures and a curfew between 7pm and 5am. Respondents were asked to report all direct physical and non-physical contacts made the previous day, alongside a questionnaire asking about the social and economic impact of COVID-19 and control measures. We examined contact patterns by demographic factors, including socioeconomic status. We described the impact of COVID-19 and control measures on income and food security. We compared contact patterns during control measures to patterns from non-pandemic periods to estimate the change in R 0 . <h4>Findings</h4> We estimate that control measures reduced physical and non-physical contacts, reducing the R 0 from around 2.6 to between 0.5 and 0.7, depending on the pre-COVID-19 comparison matrix used. Masks were worn by at least one person in 92% of contacts. Respondents in the poorest socioeconomic quintile reported 1.5 times more contacts than those in the richest. 86% of respondents reported a total or partial loss of income due to COVID-19, and 74% reported eating less or skipping meals due to having too little money for food. <h4>Interpretation</h4> COVID-19 control measures have had a large impact on direct contacts and therefore transmission, but have also caused considerable economic and food insecurity. Reductions in R 0 are consistent with the linear epidemic growth in Kenya and other sub-Saharan African countries that implemented similar, early control measures. However, negative and inequitable impacts on economic and food security may mean control measures are not sustainable in the longer term. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We conducted a PubMed search on 6 June 2020 with no language restrictions for studies published since inception, using the search terms (“social mix*” OR “social cont*” OR “contact pattern*) AND (“covid*”). The search yielded 53 articles, two of which reported changes in social contacts after COVID-19 control measures. The first study reported changes in contact patterns in Wuhan and Shanghai, and the second changes in contact patterns in the UK. We found no studies examining changes in contact patterns due to control measures in sub-Saharan Africa, and no studies disaggregating contacts by socioeconomic status. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> This is the first study to estimate the reproduction number of COVID-19 under control measures in sub-Saharan Africa using primary contact data. This study also moves beyond existing work to i) measure contacts in densely populated informal settlements, ii) explore how social contacts vary across socioeconomic status, and iii) assess the impact of control measures on economic and food security in these areas. <h4>Implications of all the evidence</h4> COVID-19 control measures have substantially reduced social contacts and disease transmission. People of lower socioeconomic status face greater transmission risk as they report more contacts. Control measures have led to considerable economic and food insecurity, and may not be sustainable in the long term without efforts to reduce the burden of control measures on households.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/06/07/2020.06.06.20122689.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.06.20122689; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR172602; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR172602&type=FILE&fileName=EMS91656-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We aimed to determine the effectiveness of post-hospital apixaban in reducing the rate of death and hospital readmission of hospitalised adults with COVID-19. <h4>Methods</h4> HEAL COVID is an adaptive randomised open label multicentre platform trial recruiting participants from National Health Service Hospitals in the United Kingdom. Here we report the preliminary results of apixaban comparison of HEAL-COVID. Participants with a hospital admission related to confirmed COVID-19 and an expected date of discharge in the subsequent five days were randomised to either apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily or standard care (no anticoagulation) for 14 days. The primary outcome was hospital free survival at 12 months obtained through routine data sources. The trial was prospectively registered with ISRCTN (15851697) and Clincialtrials.gov ( NCT04801940 ). <h4>Findings</h4> Between 19 May 2021 and 21 November 2022, 402 participants from 109 sites were randomised to apixaban and 399 to standard care. Seven participants withdrew from the apixaban group and one from the standard care group. Analysis was undertaken on an intention-to-treat basis. The apixaban arm was stopped on the recommendation of the oversight committees following an interim analysis due to no indication of benefit. Of the 402 participants randomised to apixaban, 117 experienced death or rehospitalisation during a median follow-up of 344·5 days (IQR 125 to 365), and 123 participants receiving standard care experienced death or rehospitalisation during a median follow-up of 349 days (IQR 124 to 365). There was no statistical difference in the rate of death and rehospitalisation (HR: 0·96 99%CI 0·69-1·34; p=0·75). Three participants in the apixaban arm experienced clinically significant bleeding during treatment. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Fourteen days of post-hospital anticoagulation with the direct oral anticoagulant apixaban did not reduce the rate of death or rehospitalisation of adults hospitalised with COVID-19.

Currently, contacts traced manually through the NHS Test and Trace scheme in the UK are asked to self-isolate for 14 days from the day they were exposed to the index case, which represents the upper bound for the incubation period (2). However, following previous work on screening strategies for air travellers (3,4) it may be possible that this quarantine period could be reduced if combined with PCR testing. Adapting the simulation model for contact tracing, we find that quarantine periods of at least 10 days combined with a PCR test on day 9 may largely emulate the results from a 14-day quarantine period in terms of the averted transmission potential from secondary cases (72% (95%UI: 3%, 100%) vs 75% (4%, 100%), respectively). These results assume the delays from testing index cases’ and tracing their contacts are minimised (no longer than 4.5 days on average). If secondary cases are traced and quarantined 1 day earlier on average, shorter quarantine periods of 8 days with a test on day 7 (76% (7%, 100%)) approach parity with the 14 day quarantine period with a 1 day longer delay to the index cases’ test. However, the risk of false-negative PCR tests early in a traced case’s infectious period likely prevents the use of testing to reduce quarantine periods further than this, and testing immediately upon tracing, with release if negative, will avert just 17% of transmission potential on average. In conclusion, the use of PCR testing is an effective strategy for reducing quarantine periods for secondary cases, while still reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, especially if delays in the test and trace system can be reduced, and may improve quarantine compliance rates.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/10/23/2020.08.21.20177808.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.21.20177808; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR204755; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR204755&type=FILE&fileName=EMS95490-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Following reintroduction in services, we explored the impact on inequalities in uptake of the Bowel Screening Wales (BSW) programme to identify groups who may benefit from tailored interventions. <h4>Methods</h4> Records within the BSW were linked to electronic health records (EHR) and administrative data within the Secured Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. Ethnic group was obtained from a linked data method available within SAIL. We examined uptake for the first 3 months of invitations (August to October) following the reintroduction of BSW programme in 2020, compared to the same period in the preceding 3 years. Uptake was measured across a 6 month follow-up period. Logistic models were conducted to analyse variations in uptake by sex, age group, income deprivation quintile, urban/rural location, ethnic group, and clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) status in each period; and to compare uptake within sociodemographic groups between different periods. <h4>Results</h4> Uptake during August to October 2020 (period 2020/21; 60.4%) declined compared to the same period in 2019/20 (62.7%) but remained above the 60% Welsh standard. Variation by sex, age, income deprivation, and ethnic groups was observed in all periods studied. Compared to the pre-pandemic period in 2019/20, uptake declined for most demographic groups, except for older individuals (70-74 years) and those in the most income deprived group. Uptake continues to be lower in males, younger individuals, people living in the most income deprived areas and those of Asian and unknown ethnic backgrounds. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Our findings are encouraging with overall uptake achieving the 60% Welsh standard during the first three months after the programme restarted in 2020 despite the disruption. Inequalities did not worsen after the programme resumed activities but variations in CRC screening in Wales associated with sex, age, deprivation and ethnicity remain.

We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a 2019 nCoV-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in: the number of initial cases; the basic reproduction number R 0 ; the delay from symptom onset to isolation; the probability contacts were traced; the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort. <h4>Findings</h4> While simulated outbreaks starting with only 5 initial cases, R 0 of 1.5 and little transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability, the prospects of controlling an outbreak dramatically dropped with the number of initial cases, with higher R 0 , and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R 0 of 1.5 were controllable with under 50% of contacts successfully traced. For R 0 of 2.5 and 3.5, more than 70% and 90% of contacts respectively had to be traced to control the majority of outbreaks. The delay between symptom onset and isolation played the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable for lower values of R 0 . For higher values of R 0 and a large initial number of cases, contact tracing and isolation was only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset. <h4>Interpretation</h4> We found that in most scenarios contact tracing and case isolation alone is unlikely to control a new outbreak of 2019-nCov within three months. The probability of control decreases with longer delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts. <h4>Funding</h4> Wellcome Trust, Global Challenges Research Fund, and HDR UK. <h4>Research in Context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> Contact tracing and isolation of cases is a commonly used intervention for controlling infectious disease outbreaks. This intervention can be effective, but may require intensive public health effort and cooperation to effectively reach and monitor all contacts. When the pathogen has infectiousness before symptom onset, control of outbreaks using contact tracing and isolation is more challenging. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> This study uses a mathematical model to assess the feasibility of contact tracing and case isolation to control outbreaks of 2019-nCov, a newly emerged pathogen. We used disease transmission characteristics specific to the pathogen and therefore give the best available evidence if contact tracing and isolation can achieve control of outbreaks. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Contact tracing and isolation may not contain outbreaks of 2019-nCoV unless very high levels of contact tracing are achieved. Even in this case, if there is asymptomatic transmission, or a high fraction of transmission before onset of symptoms, this strategy may not achieve control within three months.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/11/2020.02.08.20021162.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021162; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR112367; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR112367&type=FILE&fileName=EMS159852-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We aim to evaluate containment strategies that are sustainable and effective for LMICs. We constructed synthetic populations with varying contact and household structures to capture LMIC demographic characteristics that vary across communities. Using an agent- based model, we explored the optimal containment strategies for rural and urban communities by designing and simulating setting-specific strategies that deploy rapid diagnostic tests, symptom screening, contact tracing and physical distancing. In low-density rural communities, we found implementing either high quality (sensitivity > 50%) antigen rapid diagnostic tests or moderate physical distancing could contain the transmission. In urban communities, we demonstrated that both physical distancing and case finding are essential for containing COVID-19 (average infection rate < 10%). In high density communities that resemble slums and squatter settlements, physical distancing is less effective compared to rural and urban communities. Lastly, we demonstrated contact tracing is essential for effective containment. Our findings suggested that rapid diagnostic tests could be prioritised for control and monitor COVID-19 transmission and highlighted that contact survey data could guide strategy design to save resources for LMICs.

The objective of the initiative is to support a better understanding of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) and development of machine learning (ML) technologies that will improve care for patients hospitalised with a severe COVID-19 infection. The NCCID is now accumulating data from 20 NHS Trusts and Health Boards across England and Wales, with a total contribution of approximately 25,000 imaging studies in the training set (at time of writing) and is actively being used as a research tool by several organisations. This paper introduces the training dataset, including a snapshot analysis performed by NHSX covering: the completeness of clinical data, the availability of image data for the various use-cases (diagnosis, prognosis and longitudinal risk) and potential model confounders within the imaging data. The aim is to inform both existing and potential data users of the NCCID’s suitability for developing diagnostic/prognostic models. In addition, a cohort analysis was performed to measure the representativeness of the NCCID to the wider COVID-19 affected population. Three major aspects were included: geographic, demographic and temporal coverage, revealing good alignment in some categories, e.g., sex and identifying areas for improvements to data collection methods, particularly with respect to geographic coverage.

This study aimed to investigate if disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) safety monitoring was affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. <h4>Methods</h4> A population-based cohort study was conducted with the approval of NHS England, using the OpenSAFELY platform to access electronic health record data from 24·2 million patients registered at general practices using TPP’s SystmOne software. Patients were included for further analysis if prescribed azathioprine, leflunomide, or methotrexate between November 2019 and July 2022. Outcomes were assessed as monthly trends and variation between various sociodemographic and clinical groups for adherence with standard safety monitoring recommendations. <h4>Findings</h4> An acute increase in the rate of missed monitoring occurred across the study population (+12·4 percentage points) when lockdown measures were implemented in March 2020. This increase was more pronounced for some patient groups (70-79 year-olds: +13·7 percentage points; females: +12·8 percentage points), regions (North West: +17·0 percentage points), medications (Leflunomide: +20·7 percentage points), and monitoring tests (Blood Pressure: +24·5 percentage points). Missed monitoring rates decreased substantially for all groups by July 2022. Substantial and consistent differences were observed in overall missed monitoring rates between several groups throughout the study. <h4>Interpretation</h4> DMARD monitoring rates temporarily deteriorated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Deterioration coincided with the onset of lockdown measures, with monitoring rates recovering rapidly as lockdown measures were eased. Differences observed in monitoring rates between medications, tests, regions, and patient groups, highlight opportunities to tackle potential inequalities in the provision or uptake of monitoring services. Further research should aim to evaluate the causes of the differences identified between groups. <h4>Funding</h4> None. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are immunosuppressive and/or immunomodulatory drugs, which carry risks of serious adverse effects such as; gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, and pulmonary toxicity; myelosuppression; and increased susceptibility to infection. To mitigate these safety risks, national safety guidance recommends that patients taking these drugs receive regular monitoring. We searched PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus for studies published between database inception and July 28th, 2022, using the terms ([covid-19] AND [monitoring OR shared care OR dmard OR outcome factors] AND [primary care]), with no language restrictions. Studies that investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare services were identified. One key study in England showed disruption to various monitoring services in primary care had occurred during the pandemic. Another English study highlighted a disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health outcomes in certain groups. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> Prior to this study knowledge of how high-risk drugs, such as DMARDs, were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic was limited. This study reports the impact of COVID-19 on the safety monitoring of DMARDs. Moreover, it reports variation in DMARD monitoring rates between demographic, clinical and regional subgroups, which has not yet been described. This is enabled through use of the OpenSAFELY platform, which provides secure access to pseudonymised primary care patient records in England for the purposes of analysing the COVID-19 pandemic impact. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> DMARD monitoring rates transiently deteriorated during the COVID-19 pandemic, consistent with previous research on other monitoring tests. Deterioration coincided with the onset of lockdown measures, with performance recovering rapidly as lockdown measures were eased. Differences observed in monitoring rates between demographic, clinical and regional subgroups highlight opportunities to identify and tackle potential inequalities in the provision or uptake of monitoring services. Further research should aim to evaluate the causes of the differences identified between groups, and establish the clinical relevance of missed monitoring.

We estimated excess mortality in specific CVDs, both “direct”, through infection, and “indirect”, through changes in healthcare. <h4>Methods</h4> We used population-based electronic health records from 3,862,012 individuals in England to estimate pre- and post-COVID-19 mortality risk(“direct” effect) for people with incident and prevalent CVD. We incorporated: (i)pre-COVID-19 risk by age, sex and comorbidities, (ii)estimated population COVID-19 prevalence, and (iii)estimated relative impact of COVID-19 on mortality(relative risk, RR: 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0).

In China, activity remained below pre-COVID-19 levels for 2-3 months even after easing lockdown, and is still reduced in Italy and England.

The EHR dataset included 16 million adults registered with primary care practices in England using TPP SystmOne software on 1st February 2020, with at least three months of registration, valid address data, and living in households of <16 people. <h4>Main outcome measures</h4> In the LPS, self-reported survey measures of psychological distress and life satisfaction were assessed in the nearest pre-pandemic sweep and three periods during the pandemic: April-June 2020, July-October 2020, and November 2020-March 2021. In the EHR analyses, outcomes were morbidity codes recorded in primary or secondary care between March 2018 and January 2022 reflecting the diagnoses of depression, self-harm, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, eating disorders, and severe mental illnesses. <h4>Results</h4> The LPS consisted of 37,544 participants (15.2% living alone) and we found greater psychological distress (SMD: 0.09 (95% CI: 0.04, 0.14) and lower life satisfaction (SMD: -0.22 (95% CI: -0.30, -0.15) in those living alone pre-pandemic, and the gap between the two groups stayed similar after the onset of the pandemic. In the EHR analysis of almost 16 million records (21.4% living alone), codes indicating mental health conditions were more common in those who lived alone compared to those who lived with others (e.g., depression 26 and severe mental illness 58 cases more per 100,000). Recording of mental health conditions fell during the pandemic for common mental health disorders and the gap between the two groups narrowed. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Multiple sources of data indicate that those who live alone experience greater levels of common and severe mental illnesses, and lower life satisfaction. During the pandemic this gap in need remained, however, there was a narrowing of the gap in service use, suggesting greater barriers to healthcare access for those who live alone. <h4>Summary Box</h4> <h4>What is already known on the topic?</h4> Households with one individual are an increasing demographic, comprising over a quarter of all households in the UK in 2021. However, the mental health gap between those who live alone compared to those who live with others is not well described and even less is known about the relative gaps in need and healthcare-seeking and access. The pandemic and associated restrictive measures further increased the likelihood of isolation for this group, which may have impacted mental health. <h4>What this study adds?</h4> We present comprehensive evidence from both population-based surveys and electronic health records regarding the greater levels of mental health symptoms and in recorded diagnoses for common (anxiety, depression) and less common (OCD, eating disorders, SMIs) mental health conditions for people living alone compared to those living with others. Our analyses indicate that mental health conditions are more common among those who live alone compared to those who live with others. Although levels of reported distress increased for both groups during the pandemic, healthcare-seeking dropped in both groups, and the rates of healthcare-seeking among those who live alone converged with those who live with others for common mental health conditions. This suggests greater barriers for treatment access among those that live alone. The findings have implications for mental health service planning and efforts to reduce barriers to treatment access, especially for individuals who live on their own.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/03/15/2023.03.15.23287292.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.15.23287292; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR630589; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR630589&type=FILE&fileName=EMS172468-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We measured contact patterns weekly from March 2020 to March 2021 to estimate the impact of these policies, covering three national lockdowns interspersed by periods of lower restrictions. <h4>Methods</h4> Data were collected using online surveys of representative samples of the UK population by age and gender. We calculated the mean daily contacts reported using a (clustered) bootstrap and fitted a censored negative binomial model to estimate age-stratified contact matrices and estimate proportional changes to the basic reproduction number under controlled conditions using the change in contacts as a scaling factor. <h4>Results</h4> The survey recorded 101,350 observations from 19,914 participants who reported 466,710 contacts over 53 weeks. Contact patterns changed over time and by participants’ age, personal risk factors, and perception of risk. The mean of reported contacts among adults have reduced compared to previous surveys with adults aged 18 to 59 reporting a mean of 2.39 (95% CI 2.20 - 2.60) contacts to 4.93 (95% CI 4.65 - 5.19) contacts, and the mean contacts for school-age children was 3.07 (95% CI 2.89 - 3.27) to 15.11 (95% CI 13.87 - 16.41).

The final 4C Mortality Score included eight variables readily available at initial hospital assessment: age, sex, number of comorbidities, respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, level of consciousness, urea, and C-reactive protein (score range 0-21 points). The 4C risk stratification score demonstrated high discrimination for mortality (derivation cohort: AUROC 0.79; 95% CI 0.78 − 0.79; validation cohort 0.78, 0.77-0.79) with excellent calibration (slope = 1.0).

However, estimating vaccine effectiveness using observational data is inherently challenging because of the non-randomised design and the potential for unmeasured confounding. <h4>Methods</h4> We used a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) to estimate vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 mortality in England, exploiting the discontinuity in vaccination rates resulting from the UK’s age-based vaccination priority groups. We used the fact that people aged 80 or over were prioritised for the vaccine roll-out in the UK to compare the risk of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 death in people aged 75–79 and 80–84. <h4>Findings</h4> The prioritisation of vaccination of people aged 80 or above led to a large discrepancy in vaccination rates in people 80–84 compared to those 75–79 at the beginning of the vaccination campaign. We found a corresponding difference in COVID-19 mortality, but not in non-COVID-19 mortality, suggesting that our approach appropriately addresses the issue of unmeasured confounding factors. Our results suggest that the first vaccine dose reduced the risk of COVID-19 death by 52.6% (95% Cl 26.6–84.2) in those aged 80. <h4>Interpretations</h4> Our results support existing evidence that a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine has a strong protective effect against COVID-19 mortality in older adults. The RDD estimate of vaccine effectiveness is comparable to previously published studies using different methods, suggesting that unmeasured confounding factors are unlikely to substantially bias these studies. <h4>Funding</h4> Office for National Statistics. <h4>Research in Context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We searched PubMed for studies reporting on the ‘real-world’ effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccination on risk of death using terms such as “COVID-19”, “vaccine effectiveness”, “mortality” and “death”. The relevant published studies on this topic report vaccine effectiveness estimates against risk of death ranging from 64.2% to 98.7%, for varying times post-vaccination. All of these are observational studies and therefore potentially subject to bias from unmeasured confounding. We found no studies that used a quasi-experimental method such as regression discontinuity design, which is not subject to bias from unmeasured confounding, to calculate the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccination on risk of COVID-19 death, or on other outcomes such as hospitalisation or infection. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> The estimates of vaccine effectiveness based on observational data may be biased by unmeasured confounding. This study uses a regression discontinuity design to estimate vaccine effectiveness, exploiting the fact that the vaccination campaign in the UK was rolled out following age-based priority groups. This enables the calculation of an unbiased estimate of the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine against risk of death. The vaccine effectiveness estimate of 52.6% (95% Cl 26.6–84.2) is slightly lower but similar to previously published estimates, therefore suggesting that these estimates are not substantially affected by unmeasured confounding factors and confirming the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine against risk of COVID-19 death. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Obtaining an unbiased estimate of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness is of vital importance in informing policy for lifting COVID-19 related measures. The regression discontinuity design provides confidence that the existing estimates from observational studies are unlikely to be substantially biased by unmeasured confounding.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/10/08/2021.07.12.21260385.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.12.21260385; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR370776; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR370776&type=FILE&fileName=EMS130767-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We used Cox regression (adjusting for confounders) to estimate hazard ratios (HR) comparing risk of COVID-19-death, death/critical care admission, and hospitalisation (March to September 2020) in: 1) people with IMIDs compared to the general population; and 2) people with IMIDs on targeted immune modifying drugs (e.g., biologics) compared to standard systemic treatment (e.g., methotrexate). <h4>Findings</h4> We identified 17,672,065 adults; of 1,163,438 (7%) with IMIDs, 19,119 people received targeted immune modifying drugs, and 200,813 received standard systemics. We saw evidence of increased COVID-19-death (HR 1.23, 95%CI 1.20, 1.27), and COVID-19 hospitalisation (HR 1.32, 95%CI 1.29, 1.35) in individuals with IMIDs overall compared to individuals without IMIDs of the same age, sex, deprivation and smoking status. We saw no evidence of increased COVID-19 deaths with targeted compared to standard systemic treatments (HR 1.03, 95%CI 0.80, 1.33). There was no evidence of increased COVID-19-related death in those prescribed TNF inhibitors, IL-12/23, IL7, IL-6 or JAK inhibitors compared to standard systemics. Rituximab was associated with increased COVID-19 death (HR 1.68, 95%CI 1.11, 2.56); however, this finding may relate to confounding. <h4>Interpretation</h4> COVID-19 death and hospitalisation was higher in people with IMIDs. We saw no increased risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes in those on most targeted immune modifying drugs for IMIDs compared to standard systemics. <h4>RESEARCH IN CONTEXT</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We searched PubMed on May 19 th , 2021, using the terms “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2” and “rheumatoid arthritis”, “psoriatic arthritis” “ankylosing spondylitis”, “Crohn’s disease” “ulcerative colitis” “hidradenitis suppurativa” and “psoriasis”, to identify primary research articles examining severe COVID-19 outcome risk in individuals with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) and those on immune modifying therapy. The studies identified (including matched cohort studies and studies in disease-specific registries) were limited by small sample sizes and number of outcomes. Most studies did not show a signal of increased adverse COVID-19 outcomes in those on targeted therapies, with the exception of rituximab. Additionally, disease-specific registries are subject to selection bias and lack denominator populations. <h4>Added value of the study</h4> In our large population-based study of 17 million individuals, including 1 million people with IMIDs and just under 200,000 receiving immune modifying medications, we saw evidence that people with IMIDs had an increased risk of COVID-19-related death compared to the general population after adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, deprivation, smoking status) (HR 1.23, 95%CI 1.20, 1.27). We saw differences by IMID type, with COVID-19-related death being increased by the most in people with inflammatory joint disease (HR 1.47, 95%CI 1.40, 1.54). We also saw some evidence that those with IMIDs were more likely, compared to the general population, to have COVID-19-related critical care admission/death (HR 1.24, 95%CI 1.21, 1.28) and hospitalisation (HR 1.32, 95%CI 1.29, 1.35). Compared to people with IMIDs taking standard systemics, we saw no evidence of differences in severe COVID-19-related outcomes with TNF inhibitors, IL-17 inhibitors, IL-12/23 inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors and JAK inhibitors. However, there was some evidence that rituximab was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related death (HR 1.68, 95%CI 1.11, 2.56) and death/critical care admission (HR 1.92, 95%CI 1.31, 2.81). We also saw evidence of an increase in COVID-19-related hospital admissions in people prescribed rituximab (HR 1.59, 95%CI 1.16, 2.18) or JAK inhibition (HR 1.81, 95%CI 1.09, 3.01) compared to those on standard systemics, although this could be related to worse underlying health rather than the drugs themselves, and numbers of events were small. This is the first study to our knowledge to use high-cost drug data on medicines supplied by hospitals at a national scale in England (to identify targeted therapies). The availability of these data fills an important gap in the medication record of those with more specialist conditions treated by hospitals creating an important opportunity to generate insights to these conditions and these medications <h4>Implications of all of the available evidence</h4> Our study offers insights into future risk mitigation strategies and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination priorities for individuals with IMIDs, as it highlights that those with IMIDs and those taking rituximab may be at risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Critically, our study does not show a link between most targeted immune modifying medications compared to standard systemics and severe COVID-19 outcomes. However, the increased risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes that we saw in people with IMIDs and those treated with rituximab merits further study.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/05/06/2021.09.03.21262888.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.03.21262888; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR393011; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.03.21262888

This study aims to investigate the impact of the pandemic on population birth outcomes in Wales, rates of primary immunisations and examine expectant mothers’ experiences of pregnancy including self-reported levels of stress and anxiety. <h4>Methods</h4> Population-level birth outcomes in Wales: Stillbirths, prematurity, birth weight and Caesarean section births before (2016–2019) and during (2020) the pandemic were compared using national-level routine anonymised data held in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. The first three scheduled primary immunisations were compared between 2019 and 2020. Self-reported pregnancy experience: 215 expectant mothers (aged 16+) in Wales completed an online survey about their experiences of pregnancy during the pandemic. The qualitative survey data was analysed using codebook thematic analysis. <h4>Findings</h4> There was no significant difference between annual outcomes including gestation and birth weight, stillbirths, and Caesarean sections for infants born in 2020 compared to 2016-2019. There was an increase in late term births (≥42 weeks gestation) during the first lockdown (OR: 1.28, p=0.019) and a decrease in moderate to late preterm births (32-36 weeks gestation) during the second lockdown (OR: 0.74, p=0.001). Fewer babies were born in 2020 (N=29,031) compared to 2016-2019 (average N=32,582). All babies received their immunisations in 2020, but there were minor delays in the timings of vaccines.

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate heterogeneity in associations between various heart disease subtypes and in-hospital mortality. <h4>Method and results</h4> We used data from the CAPACITY-COVID registry and LEOSS study. Multivariable Poisson regression models were fitted to assess the association between different types of pre-existent heart disease and in-hospital mortality. 16,511 patients with COVID-19 were included (21.1% aged 66 – 75 years; 40.2% female) and 31.5% had a history of heart disease. Patients with heart disease were older, predominantly male and often had other comorbid conditions when compared to those without. Mortality was higher in patients with cardiac disease (29.7%; n=1545 versus 15.9%; n=1797). However, following multivariable adjustment this difference was not significant (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 1.08 [95% CI 1.02 – 1.15; p-value 0.12 (corrected for multiple testing)]). Associations with in-hospital mortality by heart disease subtypes differed considerably, with the strongest association for heart failure aRR (1.19 [1.10 – 1.30]; p-value <0.018) particularly for severe NYHA III/IV) heart failure (aRR 1.41 [95% CI 1.20 – 1.64; p-value <0.018].

This observational cohort study of adults with hypertension registered in 193 primary care practices in North-East London between January 2019 and October 2022 investigated the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on the treatment and control of blood pressure including demographic and social inequities. <h4>Method and findings</h4> In 224,329 adults with hypertension, the proportion with a blood pressure (BP) recorded within the preceding 1 year fell from a 91% pre-pandemic peak to 62% at the end of the pandemic lock-down phase and improved to 77% by the end of the study. The proportion with controlled hypertension (<80 years old, BP ≤140/90mmHg; 80 or more years old: ≤150/90mmHg) for the same time points was 81%, 50% and 60% respectively. Using ‘blood pressure control’ (which considered only patients with a valid blood pressure recording) as the indicator attenuated the reduction to 83%, 80% and 78% respectively. The study used multivariable logistic analysis at four representative time points (Pre-pandemic: April 2019; Pre lockdown: April 2020; Lockdown: April 2021; Post-lockdown: April 2022) to identify temporal, clinical and demographic influences on blood pressure monitoring and control. Pre-pandemic inequities in the management of hypertension were not significantly altered by the pandemic. Throughout the pandemic phases, in comparison to the White ethnic group, the Black ethnic group was less likely to achieve blood pressure control (ORs 0.81 [95% CI = 0.78 to 0.85, p-value<0.001] to 0.87 [95% CI = 0.84 to 0.91, p-value<0.001]).

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK has highlighted that evidence to support AAT is not plentiful. This study assessed the real-world use of AAT D-dimers for VTE in a large cohort of acutely hospitalised patients. <h4>Methods</h4> This retrospective data study included all adult patients attending a large hospital with a suspected VTE between January 2017 to December 2021. The predictive accuracy of D-dimer was assessed against gold standard imaging. Outcomes of false negative (with AAT) and false positives (with standard thresholds) cases were assessed. <h4>Results</h4> 27,526 suspected VTE attendances were included, with a 4.3% confirmed VTE diagnosis rate. The ST D-dimer exhibited high sensitivity (91.1%) but modest specificity (65.2%). The AAT demonstrated slightly lower sensitivity (87.0%) but higher specificity (71.7%, p<0.001). The performance of ST thresholds declined with age, with false positive rates increasing from 17.4% to 80.0% in people aged < 50 years and > 90 years respectively. The AAT accurately identified 1,700 true negatives misclassified as false positives by the ST. 14 patients in this group were admitted with a bleed within 30 days.

Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 2244 critically-ill Covid-19 patients from 208 UK intensive care units (ICUs), representing >95% of all ICU beds. Ancestry-matched controls were drawn from the UK Biobank population study and results were confirmed in GWAS comparisons with two other population control groups: the 100,000 genomes project and Generation Scotland. We identify and replicate three novel genome-wide significant associations, at chr19p13.3 (rs2109069, p = 3.98 × 10 −12 ), within the gene encoding dipeptidyl peptidase 9 ( DPP9 ), at chr12q24.13 (rs10735079, p =1.65 × 10 −8 ) in a gene cluster encoding antiviral restriction enzyme activators ( OAS1, OAS2, OAS3 ), and at chr21q22.1 (rs2236757, p = 4.99 × 10 −8 ) in the interferon receptor gene IFNAR2 . Consistent with our focus on extreme disease in younger patients with less comorbidity, we detect a stronger signal at the known 3p21.31 locus than previous studies (rs73064425, p = 4.77 × 10 −30 ). We identify potential targets for repurposing of licensed medications. Using Mendelian randomisation we found evidence in support of a causal link from low expression of IFNAR2 , and high expression of TYK2 , to life-threatening disease. Transcriptome-wide association in lung tissue revealed that high expression of the monocyte/macrophage chemotactic receptor CCR2 is associated with severe Covid-19.

Lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) can deliver results rapidly and at scale, but have widely varying accuracy. <h4>Methods</h4> In a laboratory setting, we performed head-to-head comparisons of four LFIAs: the Rapid Test Consortium’s AbC-19 ™ Rapid Test, OrientGene COVID IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette, SureScreen COVID-19 Rapid Test Cassette, and Biomerica COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test. We analysed blood samples from 2,847 key workers and 1,995 pre-pandemic blood donors with all four devices. <h4>Findings</h4> We observed a clear trade-off between sensitivity and specificity: the IgG band of the SureScreen device and the AbC-19 ™ device had higher specificities but OrientGene and Biomerica higher sensitivities. Based on analysis of pre-pandemic samples, SureScreen IgG band had the highest specificity (98.9%, 95% confidence interval 98.3 to 99.3%), which translated to the highest positive predictive value across any pre-test probability: for example, 95.1% (95%CI 92.6, 96.8%) at 20% pre-test probability. All four devices showed higher sensitivity at higher antibody concentrations (“spectrum effects”), but the extent of this varied by device. <h4>Interpretation</h4> The estimates of sensitivity and specificity can be used to adjust for test error rates when using these devices to estimate the prevalence of antibody. If tests were used to determine whether an individual has SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, in an example scenario in which 20% of individuals have antibodies we estimate around 5% of positive results on the most specific device would be false positives. <h4>Funding</h4> Public Health England. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We searched for evidence on the accuracy of the four devices compared in this study: OrientGene COVID IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette, SureScreen COVID-19™ Rapid Test Cassette, Biomerica COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test and the UK Rapid Test Consortium’s AbC-19™ Rapid Test. We searched Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily), PubMed, MedRxiv/BioRxiv and Google Scholar from January 2020 to 16 th January 2021. Search terms included device names AND ((SARS-CoV-2) OR (covid)). Of 303 records assessed, data were extracted from 24 studies: 18 reporting on the accuracy of the OrientGene device, 7 SureScreen, 2 AbC-19™ and 1 Biomerica. Only three studies compared the accuracy of two or more of the four devices. With the exception of our previous report on the accuracy of the AbC-19™ device, which the current manuscript builds upon, sample size ranged from 7 to 684. For details, see Supplementary Materials. The largest study compared OrientGene, SureScreen and Biomerica. SureScreen was estimated to have the highest specificity (99.8%, 95% CI 98.9 to 100%) and OrientGene the highest sensitivity (92.6%), but with uncertainty about the latter result due to small sample sizes. The other two comparative studies were small (n = 65, n = 67) and therefore provide very uncertain results. We previously observed spectrum effects for the AbC-19™ device, such that sensitivity is upwardly biased if estimated only from PCR-confirmed cases. The vast majority of previous studies estimated sensitivity in this way. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> We performed a large scale (n = 4,842), head-to-head laboratory-based evaluation and comparison of four lateral flow devices, which were selected for evaluation by the UK Department of Health and Social Care’s New Tests Advisory Group, on the basis of a survey of test and performance data available. We evaluated the performance of diagnosis based on both IgG and IgM bands, and the IgG band alone. We found a clear trade-off between sensitivity and specificity across devices, with the SureScreen and AbC-19™ devices being more specific and OrientGene and Biomerica more sensitive. Based on analysis of 1,995 pre-pandemic blood samples, we are 99% confident that SureScreen (IgG band reading) has the highest specificity of the four devices (98.9%, 95% CI 98.3, 99.3%). We found evidence that all four devices have reduced sensitivity at lower antibody indices, i.e. spectrum effects. However, the extent of this varies by device and appears to be less for other devices than for AbC-19. Our estimates of sensitivity and specificity are likely to be higher than would be observed in real use of these devices, as they were based on majority readings of three trained laboratory personnel. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> When used in epidemiological studies of antibody prevalence, the estimates of sensitivity and specificity provided in this study can be used to adjust for test errors. Increased precision in error rates will translate to increased precision in seroprevalence estimates. If lateral flow devices were used for individual risk assessment, devices with maximum specificity would be preferable. However, if, for an example, 20% of the tested population had antibodies, we estimate that around 1 in 20 positive results on the most specific device would be incorrect.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/02/01/2021.01.30.21250777.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.30.21250777; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR276958; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.30.21250777

Many deep learning models have been proposed to conduct clinical predictive tasks such as mortality prediction for COVID-19 patients in intensive care units using Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. Despite their initial success in certain clinical applications, there is currently a lack of benchmarking results to achieve a fair comparison so that we can select the optimal model for clinical use. Furthermore, there is a discrepancy between the formulation of traditional prediction tasks and real-world clinical practice in intensive care. To fill these gaps, we propose two clinical prediction tasks, Outcome-specific length-of-stay prediction and Early mortality prediction for COVID-19 patients in intensive care units. The two tasks are adapted from the naive length-of-stay and mortality prediction tasks to accommodate the clinical practice for COVID-19 patients. We propose fair, detailed, open-source data-preprocessing pipelines and evaluate 17 state-of-the-art predictive models on two tasks, including 5 machine learning models, 6 basic deep learning models and 6 deep learning predictive models specifically designed for EHR data. We provide benchmarking results using data from two real-world COVID-19 EHR datasets. One dataset is publicly available without needing any inquiry and another dataset can be accessed on request. We provide fair, reproducible benchmarking results for two tasks. We deploy all experiment results and models on an online platform.

We estimated the impact of such strategies on epidemic and mortality risk using the UK as a case study. <h4>Methods</h4> We used an individual based model for a synthetic population similar to the UK, that is stratified into transmission risks from the community, within the household and from other households in the same social bubble. The base case considers a situation where non-essential shops and schools are closed, the secondary household attack rate is 20% and the initial reproduction number is 0.8. We simulate a number of strategies including variations of social bubbles, i.e. the forming of exclusive pairs of households, for particular subsets of households (households including children and single occupancy households), as well as for all households. We test the sensitivity of the results to a range of alternative model assumptions and parameters. <h4>Results</h4> Clustering contacts outside the household into exclusive social bubbles is an effective strategy of increasing contacts while limiting some of the associated increase in epidemic risk. In the base case scenario social bubbles reduced cases and fatalities by 17% compared to an unclustered increase of contacts. We find that if all households were to form social bubbles the reproduction number would likely increase to 1.1 and therefore beyond the epidemic threshold of one. However, strategies that allow households with young children or single occupancy households to form social bubbles only increased the reproduction number by less than 10%. The corresponding increase in morbidity and mortality is proportional to the increase in the epidemic risk but is largely focussed in older adults independently of whether these are included in the social bubbles. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Social bubbles can be an effective way of extending contacts beyond the household limiting the increase in epidemic risk, if managed appropriately.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/06/17/2020.06.05.20123448.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.05.20123448; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR174811; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR174811&type=FILE&fileName=EMS95974-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We used international patient survey data to explore the hypothesis that greater risk-mitigating behaviour in those receiving targeted therapies may account, at least in part, for this observation. <h4>Methods</h4> Online surveys were completed by individuals with Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Diseases (RMD) (UK only) or psoriasis (globally) between 4th May and 7th September 2020. We used multiple logistic regression to assess the association between treatment type and risk-mitigating behaviour, adjusting for clinical and demographic characteristics. We characterised international variation in a mixed effects model. <h4>Results</h4> Of 3,720 participants (2,869 psoriasis, 851 RMD) from 74 countries, 2,262 (60.8%) reported the most stringent risk-mitigating behaviour (classified here under the umbrella term ‘shielding’). A greater proportion of those receiving targeted therapies (biologics and JAK inhibitors) reported shielding compared to those receiving no systemic therapy (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.63, 95% CI 1.35-1.97) and standard systemic agents (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.22-1.56). Shielding was associated with established risk factors for severe COVID-19 (male sex [OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05-1.24], obesity [OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.23-1.54], comorbidity burden [OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.15-1.78]), a primary indication of RMD (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.27-1.48) and a positive anxiety or depression screen (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.36-1.80). Modest differences in the proportion shielding were observed across nations. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Greater risk-mitigating behaviour among people with IMIDs receiving targeted therapies may contribute to the reported lower risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. The behaviour variation across treatment groups, IMIDs and nations reinforces the need for clear evidence-based patient communication on risk mitigation strategies and may help inform updated public health guidelines as the pandemic continues. <h4>Key messages</h4> <h4>What is already known about this subject?</h4> At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with immune mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) on targeted systemic immunosuppressive therapy were considered to be at higher risk of severe COVID-19. Subsequent registry data suggest that this may not the case. <h4>What does this study add?</h4> Here we characterise shielding behaviour in patients with IMIDs from a global survey. We identified that targeted systemic therapy associates with increased shielding behaviour, as do demographic risk factors for severe COVID-19 including male gender and obesity. Shielding behaviour varies across nations, albeit modestly when case-mix is taken into account. <h4>How might this impact on clinical practice or future developments?</h4> Variable shielding behaviour amongst patients with IMIDs may be an important confounder when considering differential COVID-19 risk between therapy types, so should be accounted for in analyses where possible.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/11/07/2020.11.05.20226662.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.05.20226662; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR235696; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR235696&type=FILE&fileName=EMS103847-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Understanding how the capacity of other urgent care services and the health of a population may influence ED attendances is imperative for commissioners and policy makers to develop long-term strategies for reducing this pressure and improving quality and safety. <h4>Methods</h4> We developed a novel Multi-Granular Stacked Regression (MGSR) model using publicly available data to predict future mean monthly ED attendances within Clinical Commissioning Group regions in England. The MGSR combines measures of population health and health service capacity in other related settings. We assessed model performance using the R-squared statistic, measuring variance explained, and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), measuring forecasting accuracy. We used the MGSR to forecast ED demand over a 4-year period under hypothetical scenarios where service capacity is increased, or population health is improved. <h4>Results</h4> Measures of service capacity explain 41 ± 4% of the variance in monthly ED attendances and measures of population health explain 61 ± 25%. The MGSR leads to an overall improvement in performance, with an R-squared of 0.75 ± 0.03 and MAPE of 4% when forecasting mean monthly ED attendances per CCG. Using the MGSR to forecast long-term demand under different scenarios, we found improving population health would reduce peak ED attendances per CCG by approximately 600 per month after 2 years. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Combining models of population health and wider urgent care service capacity for predicting monthly ED attendances leads to an improved performance compared to each model individually.

Despite significant efforts to develop biomarkers of aging, few studies have focused on biomarkers of healthspan. We developed a proteomics-based signature of healthspan (healthspan proteomic score (HPS)) using proteomic data from the Olink Explore 3072 assay in the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (53,018 individuals and 2920 proteins). A lower HPS was associated with higher mortality risk and several age-related conditions, such as COPD, diabetes, heart failure, cancer, myocardial infarction, dementia, and stroke. HPS showed superior predictive accuracy for these outcomes compared to other biological age measures. Proteins associated with HPS were enriched in hallmark pathways such as immune response, inflammation, cellular signaling, and metabolic regulation. The external validity was evaluated using the Essential Hypertension Epigenetics study with proteomic data also from the Olink Explore 3072 and complementary epigenetic data, making it a valuable tool for assessing healthspan and as a potential surrogate marker to complement existing proteomic and epigenetic biological age measures in geroscience-guided studies. <h4>Significance</h4> Despite substantial efforts to develop biomarkers of aging, few studies have focused on biomarkers of healthspan. The challenge lies in the need for long follow-up periods and large sample sizes of healthy individuals to observe aging outcomes. Therefore, developing surrogate biomarkers that can predict healthspan is crucial. We addressed this by developing a proteomics-based signature of healthspan, termed the Healthspan Proteomic Score (HPS), in a healthy cohort. We demonstrated its clinical, predictive, and biological validity in the UK Biobank and Essential Hypertension Epigenetics study, which represents a focused subset of the Finnish Twin Cohort.

Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower propensity to show clinical symptoms, or both. We evaluate these possibilities by fitting an age-structured mathematical model to epidemic data from six countries. We estimate that clinical symptoms occur in 25% (95% CrI: 19-32%) of infections in 10-19-year-olds, rising to 76% (68-82%) in over-70s, and that susceptibility to infection in under-20s is approximately half that of older adults. Accordingly, we find that interventions aimed at children may have a relatively small impact on total cases, particularly if the transmissibility of subclinical infections is low. The age-specific clinical fraction and susceptibility we have estimated has implications for the expected global burden of COVID-19 because of demographic differences across settings: in younger populations, the expected clinical attack rate would be lower, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will affect disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with older populations may see disproportionally more clinical cases, particularly in the later stages of the pandemic.","COVID-19 reported cases amongst young children are low while old people are at higher risk of disease and death.

Alternative lay summary: This study aimed to explain the differences in the risk of infection with COVID-19 between people of different ages, using data from 6 countries. The authors found that age was a very important factor in showing signs of infection (20% chance of having symptoms aged <10y, 70% in older adults), but that age may not influence the chance of being infected. These findings are important because they suggest that closing schools may be less effective in preventing spread of infection than for infections like influenza where children play a bigger role in spreading the disease.",pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/05/03/2020.03.24.20043018.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20043018; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR129796; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR129796&type=FILE&fileName=EMS89351-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

However it is unclear how specific factors are differentially associated with COVID-19 mortality as compared to mortality from other causes. <h4>Methods</h4> Working on behalf of NHS England, we carried out a cohort study within the OpenSAFELY platform. Primary care data from England were linked to national death registrations. We included all adults (aged ≥18 years) in the database on 1 st February 2020 and with >1 year of continuous prior registration, the cut-off date for deaths was 9 th November 2020. Associations between individual-level characteristics and COVID-19 and non-COVID deaths were estimated by fitting age- and sex-adjusted logistic models for these two outcomes. <h4>Results</h4> 17,456,515 individuals were included. 17,063 died from COVID-19 and 134,316 from other causes. Most factors associated with COVID-19 death were similarly associated with non-COVID death, but the magnitudes of association differed. Older age was more strongly associated with COVID-19 death than non-COVID death (e.g. ORs 40.7 [95% CI 37.7-43.8] and 29.6 [28.9-30.3] respectively for ≥80 vs 50-59 years), as was male sex, deprivation, obesity, and some comorbidities.

Previous research has shown disparities in COVID-19 vaccination uptake among HCWs based on ethnicity, job role, sex, age, and deprivation. However, vaccine attitudes underpinning these variations are yet to be fully explored. <h4>Methods</h4> We conducted a qualitative study with 164 HCWs from different ethnicities, sexes, job roles, migration statuses, and regions in the United Kingdom (UK). Interviews and focus groups were conducted using Microsoft Teams or telephone, and recorded with participants’ permission. Recordings were transcribed and thematically analysed following an inductive approach. <h4>Findings</h4> We conducted an in-depth analysis of 53 randomly selected transcripts (involving 82 participants) to generate rapid evidence. Four different vaccine attitudes were identified: Active Acceptance, Passive Acceptance, Passive Decline, and Active Decline. Factors influencing vaccine acceptance include: knowledge of vaccine; risk perception; positive attitude towards other vaccines; social influences; and considerations about the future. Correspondingly, barriers to vaccine acceptance were identified as, low trust in the vaccine and historical (mis)trust, inadequate communication, and inequities in delivery and access. Opinion on mandatory vaccination was divided. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Our data show that vaccine attitudes are diverse and elements of hesitancy may remain even after vaccine acceptance. This has implications for the sustainability of the vaccine programme, particularly as new components (e.g. boosters) are being added.

Our survey findings revealed that 52.6% of the Black and Brown staff experienced unfair treatment in the pandemic concerning Covid deployment, PPE or risk assessment provision. Similarly, 59% had experienced racism during their working lives, making it difficult to do their job; thus, 36% had left a job. Most participants reported that exclusion and neglect as a form of bullying were among the most widely recounted experiences that took a toll on their lives; for example, 53% said racism had impacted their mental health.<br><br>Interpretation: Our research underscores that the endemic culture of racism is a fundamental factor that must be recognised and called out. Colourblindness exacerbates racist practices. We argue that only implementing an active zero tolerance to racism policy with penalties for organisations that do not comply can change the status quo.<br><br>Funding Information: This work was supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, UK [AH/V008714/1, 2020].<br>	<br>Declaration of Interests: All authors declare no conflict of interest.<br><br>Ethics Approval Statement: Ethics approval was obtained by Sheffield Hallam University Research Ethics Committee.<br>",,doi:https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4023214; doi:https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4023214; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR602738; doi:https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4023214

We describe vaccine coverage and time trends across a range of demographic and fine-grained clinical subgroups in eight Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) priority cohorts. <h4>Results</h4> 20,852,692 patients (36%) received a COVID-19 vaccine between December 8th 2020 and March 17th 2021. Of patients aged ≥80 not in a care home (JCVI group 2) 94.7% received a vaccine, but with substantial variation by ethnicity (White 96.2% vaccinated, Black 68.3%) and deprivation (least deprived 96.6%, most deprived 90.7%). Overall, patients with pre-existing medical conditions were equally or more likely to be vaccinated with two exceptions: severe mental illness (89.5% vaccinated) and learning disability (91.4%). 275,205 vaccine recipients were identified as care home residents (priority group 1; 91.2% coverage). 1,257,914 (6.0%) recipients have had a second dose. Detailed characteristics of recipients in all cohorts are reported. <h4>Conclusions</h4> The NHS in England has rapidly delivered mass vaccination. We were able to deploy a data monitoring framework using publicly auditable methods and a secure, in-situ processing model, using linked but pseudonymised patient-level NHS data on 57.9 million patients with very short delays from vaccine administration to completed analysis.

Differences in anxiety/depression were less pronounced. Younger, female HCWs, and those who were not doctors had increased odds of symptoms of both PTSD and anxiety/depression. Ethnic minority HCWs were more likely to experience the following work factors that were also associated with mental ill-health: workplace discrimination, feeling insecure in raising workplace concerns, seeing more patients with COVID-19, reporting lack of access to personal protective equipment (PPE), and working longer hours and night shifts. Ethnic minority HCWs were also more likely to live in a deprived area and have experienced bereavement due to COVID-19. After adjusting for sociodemographic and work factors, ethnic differences in PTSD were less pronounced and ethnic minority HCWs had lower odds of anxiety/depression compared to White HCWs. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Ethnic minority HCWs were more likely to experience PTSD and disproportionately experienced work and sociodemographic factors associated with PTSD, anxiety and depression.

Clinical codes to describe this phenomenon were released in November 2020 in the UK, but it is not known how these codes have been used in practice. <h4>Methods</h4> Working on behalf of NHS England, we used OpenSAFELY data encompassing 96% of the English population. We measured the proportion of people with a recorded code for long COVID, overall and by demographic factors, electronic health record software system, and week. We also measured variation in recording amongst practices. <h4>Results</h4> Long COVID was recorded for 23,273 people. Coding was unevenly distributed amongst practices, with 26.7% of practices having not used the codes at all. Regional variation was high, ranging between 20.3 per 100,000 people for East of England (95% confidence interval 19.3-21.4) and 55.6 in London (95% CI 54.1-57.1).

We estimated how COVID-19-related disruptions could impact HIV transmission and mortality among men who have sex with men (MSM) in four cities in China. <h4>Methods</h4> Regional data from China indicated that the number of MSM undergoing facility-based HIV testing reduced by 59% during the COVID-19 pandemic, alongside reductions in ART initiation (34%), numbers of sexual partners (62%) and consistency of condom use (25%). A deterministic mathematical model of HIV transmission and treatment among MSM in China was used to estimate the impact of these disruptions on the number of new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths. Disruption scenarios were assessed for their individual and combined impact over 1 and 5 years for a 3-, 4- or 6-month disruption period. <h4>Results</h4> Our China model predicted that new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths would be increased most by disruptions to viral suppression, with 25% reductions for a 3-month period increasing HIV infections by 5-14% over 1 year and deaths by 7-12%. Observed reductions in condom use increased HIV infections by 5-14% but had minimal impact (<1%) on deaths. Smaller impacts on infections and deaths (<3%) were seen for disruptions to facility testing and ART initiation, but reduced partner numbers resulted in 11-23% fewer infections and 0.4-1.0% fewer deaths. Longer disruption periods of 4 and 6 months amplified the impact of combined disruption scenarios. When all realistic disruptions were modelled simultaneously, an overall decrease in new HIV infections was always predicted over one year (3-17%), but not over 5 years (1% increase-4% decrease), while deaths mostly increased over one year (1-2%) and 5 years (1.2 increase – 0.3 decrease). <h4>Conclusions</h4> The overall impact of COVID-19 on new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths is dependent on the nature, scale and length of the various disruptions. Resources should be directed to ensuring levels of viral suppression and condom use are maintained to mitigate any adverse effects of COVID-19 related disruption on HIV transmission and control among MSM in China.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/10/13/2020.10.08.20209072.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.08.20209072; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR224937; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR224937&type=FILE&fileName=EMS98388-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

The model used anonymised patient records between 2016-2019 of elective orthopaedic procedures from an NHS Trust in England. In this paper, it is used to investigate scenarios including resourcing (beds and theatres) and productivity (lengths-of-stay, delayed discharges, theatre activity) to support planning for meeting new NHS targets aimed at reducing elective orthopaedic surgical backlogs in a proposed ring fenced orthopaedic surgical facility. The simulation is interactive and intended for use by health service planners and clinicians. <h4>Results</h4> A higher number of beds (65-70) than the proposed number (40 beds) will be required if lengths-of-stay and delayed discharge rates remain unchanged. Reducing lengths-of-stay in line with national benchmarks reduces bed utilisation to an estimated 60%, allowing for additional theatre activity such as weekend working. Further, reducing the proportion of patients with a delayed discharge by 75% reduces bed utilisation to below 40%, even with weekend working. A range of other scenarios can also be investigated directly by NHS planners using the interactive web app. <h4>Conclusions</h4> The simulation model is intended to support capacity planning of orthopaedic elective services by identifying a balance of capacity across theatres and beds and predicting the impact of productivity measures on capacity requirements. It is applicable beyond the study site and can be adapted for other specialties. <h4>Strengths and Limitations of this study</h4> The simulation model provides rapid quantitative estimates to support post-COVID elective services recovery toward medium-term elective targets. Parameter combinations include changes to both resourcing and productivity. The interactive web app enables intuitive parameter changes by users while underlying source code can be adapted or re-used for similar applications. Patient attributes such as complexity are not included in the model but are reflected in variables such as length-of-stay and delayed discharge rates.

Testing capacity must be sufficient during the winter respiratory season when levels of cough and fever are high due to non-COVID-19 causes. This study aims to make predictions about the contribution of baseline cough or fever to future testing demand in the UK. <h4>Methods</h4> In this analysis of the Bug Watch prospective community cohort study, we estimated the incidence of cough or fever in England in 2018–2019. We then estimated the COVID-19 diagnostic testing rates required in the UK for baseline cough or fever cases for the period July 2020-June 2021. This was explored for different rates of the population requesting tests and four second wave scenarios and then compared to current national capacity. <h4>Results</h4> The baseline incidence of cough or fever in the UK is expected to rise rapidly from 154,554 (95%CI 103,083 – 231,725) cases per day in August 2020 to 250,708 (95%CI 181,095 – 347,080) in September, peaking at 444,660 (95%CI 353,084 – 559,988) in December. If 80% of baseline cough or fever cases request tests, average daily UK testing demand would exceed current capacity for five consecutive months (October 2020 to February 2021), with a peak demand of 147,240 (95%CI 73,978 – 239,502) tests per day above capacity in December 2020. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Our results show that current national COVID-19 testing capacity is likely to be exceeded by demand due to baseline cough and fever alone. This study highlights that the UK’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic must ensure that a high proportion of people with symptoms request tests, and that testing capacity is immediately scaled up to meet this high predicted demand.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/09/05/2020.09.03.20187377.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.03.20187377; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR210734; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR210734&type=FILE&fileName=EMS94741-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

The UK-REACH project has been initiated to understand ethnic differentials in COVID-19 outcomes among healthcare workers (HCWs) in the United Kingdom (UK) through five inter-linked work packages. The ethico-legal work package (Work Package 3) aims to understand and address legal, ethical and acceptability issues around big data research; the healthcare workers’ experiences work package (Work Package 4) is a qualitative study exploring healthcare workers’ experiences during COVID-19 and; the stakeholder engagement work package (Work Package 5) aims to provide feedback and support with the formulation and dissemination of the project recommendations. <h4>Methods and Analysis</h4> Work Package 3 has two different research strands: (a) desk-based doctrinal research; and (b) empirical qualitative research with key opinion leaders. For the empirical research, in-depth interviews will be conducted digitally and recorded with participants’ permission. Recordings will be transcribed, coded and analysed using thematic analysis. In Work Package 4, online in-depth interviews and focus groups will be conducted with approximately 150 HCWs, from across the UK, and these will be recorded with participants’ consent. The recordings will be transcribed, coded and data will be analysed using thematic analysis. Work Package 5 will achieve its objectives through regular group meetings and in-group discussions. <h4>Ethics and Dissemination</h4> Ethical approval has been received from the London - Brighton & Sussex Research Ethics Committee of the Health Research Authority (Ref No. 20/HRA/4718). Results of the study will be published in open access journals, and disseminated through conference presentations, project website, stakeholder organisations, media and scientific advisory groups. <h4>Registration Details</h4> Registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry ( ISRCTN11811602 ). <h4>STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY</h4> The dual approach of doctrinal and empirical research (Work Package 3) on the use of personal data by UK-REACH will give a comprehensive understanding of the ethical and legal implications of the study, and perceptions about its use of data. Qualitative research with healthcare workers in the UK on their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic (Work Package 4) will provide insight into personal behaviour, perceptions of risk and coping mechanisms adopted both inside and outside of the work environment. Stakeholder engagement (Work Package 5) from professional regulatory bodies and staff groups is embedded within the UK-REACH study to provide feedback on project activities and support with project recommendations. The target participants (key opinion leaders) for Work Package 3 empirical study will likely come from predominantly White backgrounds which may limit the breadth of views obtained in interviews. This limitation will be mitigated by active recruitment of opinion leaders from a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds and active interaction with Work Package 5. Due to the pandemic restrictions, interviews and focus group discussions will be conducted via online methods as a substitute for face-to-face meetings, posing practical and technological challenges for dynamic interaction with participants.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/03/03/2021.03.03.21252737.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.03.21252737; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR291740; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR291740&type=FILE&fileName=EMS118538-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Hospitalisation and mortality increase during winter, especially in people with multiple long-term conditions (MLTC or multimorbidity). We aimed to describe which combinations of long-term conditions (LTC) are associated with a higher risk of hospitalisation and death during winter amongst adults in England. <h4>Methods</h4> In this population-based study, we used linked primary and secondary care data from the General Practice Extraction Service Data for Pandemic Planning (GDPPR) database, Hospital Episode Statistics, and Office for National Statistics death registry. We included individuals aged ≥18 years and alive on 1 st December 2021 and used overdispersed Poisson models to estimate the incidence rate ratios of all-cause hospitalisations and deaths associated with the combinations of MLTCs – compared to those with no LTC – during the winter season (1 December 2021 to 31 March 2022). <h4>Findings</h4> Complete data were available for 48,253,125 adults, of which 15 million (31.2%) had MLTC. Hospitalisation per 1000 person-years was higher in individuals with MLTCs, and varied by combination, e.g.: 96, 1643, and 1552 in individuals with no LTC, cancer+chronic kidney disease (CKD)+cardiovascular disease (CVD)+type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cancer+CKD+CVD+osteoarthritis, respectively. Incidence of death (per 1000 person-years) was 345 in individuals with cancer+CKD+CVD+dementia and 1 with no LTC. CVD+dementia appeared in all the top five MLTC combinations by death and was associated with a substantially higher rate of death than many 3-, 4- and 5-disease combinations. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Risks of hospitalisation and death vary by combinations of MLTCs and are substantially higher in those with vs. without any LTCs. We have highlighted high-risk combinations for prioritisation and preventive action by policymakers to help manage the challenges imposed by winter pressures on the NHS. <h4>Funding</h4> National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) through Health Data Research UK rapid funding call for the research activity “Data Science to inform NHS compound winter pressure policy response” (grant number: HDRUK2022.0313) <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We searched PubMed, from inception to April 2023, for published population-based studies examining MLTC combinations in cohorts of adults aged 18 years and over. The search terms were “multimorbidity” or ‘’multiple-long-term conditions’’ alongside “groups” or “combinations”. We found no previous studies examining MLTC in relation to death or hospitalisation during the winter season. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> We have identified distinct combinations of LTCs and estimated the associated risk of hospitalisation and deaths during the winter season using the whole-population primary and secondary care data in England. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Understanding which combinations of MLTCs are associated with the highest risk of hospitalisation and death allows clinicians and policymakers to prioritise resources for preventative measures, such as vaccination to those that will benefit most during winter seasons.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/09/06/2023.09.04.23295015.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.04.23295015; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR721144; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR721144&type=FILE&fileName=EMS187607-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Subsequently, a national safety alert was issued regarding patients being inappropriately co-prescribed two anticoagulants following a medication change, and associated monitoring. <h4>Objective</h4> To describe which people were switched from warfarin to DOACs; identify potentially unsafe co-prescribing of anticoagulants; and assess whether abnormal clotting results have become more frequent during the pandemic. <h4>Methods</h4> Working on behalf of NHS England we conducted a population cohort based study using routine clinical data from >17 million adults in England. <h4>Results</h4> 20,000 of 164,000 warfarin patients (12.2%) switched to DOACs between March and May 2020, most commonly to edoxaban and apixaban. Factors associated with switching included: older age, recent renal function test, higher number of recent INR tests recorded, atrial fibrillation diagnosis and care home residency.

We observed a very small increase in elevated INRs (n=470) during April compared with January (n=420). <h4>Conclusions</h4> Increased switching of anticoagulants from warfarin to DOACs was observed at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic in England following national guidance. There was a small but substantial number of people co-prescribed warfarin and DOACs during this period. Despite a national safety alert on the issue, a widespread rise in elevated INR test results was not found.

We assessed the risk of measles outbreaks during the pandemic in Kenya as a case study for the African Region. <h4>Methods</h4> Combining measles serological data, local contact patterns, and vaccination coverage into a cohort model, we predicted the age-adjusted population immunity in Kenya and estimated the probability of outbreaks when contact-reducing COVID-19 interventions are lifted. We considered various scenarios for reduced measles vaccination coverage from April 2020. <h4>Findings</h4> In February 2020, when a scheduled SIA was postponed, population immunity was close to the herd immunity threshold and the probability of a large outbreak was 22% (0-46). As the COVID-19 restrictions to physical contact are lifted, from December 2020, the probability of a large measles outbreak increased to 31% (8-51), 35% (16-52) and 43% (31-56) assuming a 15%, 50% and 100% reduction in measles vaccination coverage. By December 2021, this risk increases further to 37% (17-54), 44% (29-57) and 57% (48-65) for the same coverage scenarios respectively. However, the increased risk of a measles outbreak following the lifting of restrictions on contact can be overcome by conducting an SIA with ≥ 95% coverage in under-fives. <h4>Interpretation</h4> While contact restrictions sufficient for SAR-CoV-2 control temporarily reduce measles transmissibility and the risk of an outbreak from a measles immunity gap, this risk rises rapidly once physical distancing is relaxed. Implementing delayed SIAs will be critical for prevention of measles outbreaks once contact restrictions are fully lifted in Kenya. <h4>Funding</h4> The United Kingdom’s Medical Research Council and the Department for International Development",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/08/31/2020.08.25.20181198.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.25.20181198; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR207614; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.25.20181198

The objective of this study is two-fold, one substantive and one methodological: substantively to evaluate the association of demographic and health records with two related, yet different, outcomes of severe COVID-19 (viz., death and ICUA); methodologically to compare interpretations based on logistic regression and on gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) predictions interpreted by means of the Shapley impacts of covariates. Very different association of some factors, e.g., obesity and chronic respiratory diseases, with death and ICUA may guide review of practice. Shapley explanation of GBDTs identified varying effects of some factors among patients, thus emphasising the importance of individual patient assessment. The results of this study are also relevant for the evaluation of complex automated clinical decision systems, which should optimise prediction scores whilst remaining interpretable to clinicians and mitigating potential biases. <h4>Author summary</h4> The design is a retrospective cohort study of 13954 in-patients of ages ranging from 1 to 105 year (IQR: 56, 70, 81) with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 by 28th June 2020. This study used multivariable logistic regression to generate odd ratios (ORs) multiply adjusted for 37 covariates (comorbidities, demographic, and others) selected on the basis of clinical interest and prior findings. Results were supplemented by gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) classification to generate Shapley values in order to evaluate the impact of the covariates on model output for all patients. Factors are differentially associated with death and ICUA and among patients. Deaths due to COVID-19 were associated with immunosuppression due to disease (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.10-1.76), type-2 diabetes (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.17-1.46), chronic respiratory disease (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.05-1.35), age (OR 1.56/10-year increment, 95% CI 1.52-1.61), and male sex (OR 1.54, 95% CI1.42-1.68). Associations of ICUA with some factors differed in direction (e.g., age, chronic respiratory disease). Self-reported ethnicities were strongly but variably associated with both outcomes. GBDTs had similar performance (ROC-AUC, ICUA 0.83, death 0.68 for GBDT; 0.80 and 0.68 for logistic regression). We derived importance scores based on Shapley values which were consistent with the ORs, despite the underlying machine-learning model being intrinsically different to the logistic regression. Chronic heart disease, hypertension, other comorbidities, and some ethnicities had Shapley impacts on death ranging from positive to negative among different patients, although consistently associated with ICUA for all. Immunosuppressive disease, type-2 diabetes, and chronic liver and respiratory diseases had positive impacts on death with either positive or negative on ICUA. We highlight the complexity of informing clinical practice and public-health interventions. We recommend that clinical support systems should not only predict patients at risk, but also yield interpretable outputs for validation by domain experts.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/04/29/2020.12.03.20242941.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.03.20242941; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR250078; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR250078&type=FILE&fileName=EMS108093-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

The true frequency and underlying mechanisms of neurological injury are unknown, but exaggerated host inflammatory responses appear to be a key driver of severe COVID-19 more broadly. We sought to investigate the dynamics of, and relationship between, serum markers of brain injury (neurofilament light [NfL], Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein [GFAP] and total Tau) and markers of dysregulated host response including measures of autoinflammation (proinflammatory cytokines) and autoimmunity. Brain injury biomarkers were measured using the Quanterix Simoa HDx platform, cytokine profiling by Luminex (R&D) and autoantibodies by a custom protein microarray. During hospitalisation, patients with COVID-19 demonstrated elevations of NfL and GFAP in a severity-dependant manner, and there was evidence of ongoing active brain injury at follow-up 4 months later. Raised NfL and GFAP were associated with both elevations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the presence of autoantibodies; autoantibodies were commonly seen against lung surfactant proteins as well as brain proteins such as myelin associated glycoprotein, but reactivity was seen to a large number of different antigens.

We have developed the OpenSAFELY Service Restoration Observatory (SRO) to describe this impact on primary care activity and monitor its recovery. <h4>Objectives</h4>  To develop key measures of primary care activity and describe the trends in these measures throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. <h4>Methods</h4>  With the approval of NHS England we developed an open source software framework for data management and analysis to describe trends and variation in clinical activity across primary care electronic health record (EHR) data on 48 million adults. We developed SNOMED-CT codelists for key measures of primary care clinical activity selected by a expert clinical advisory group and conducted a population cohort-based study to describe trends and variation in these measures January 2019-December 2021, and pragmatically classified their level of recovery one year into the pandemic using the percentage change in the median practice level rate. <h4>Results</h4>  We produced 11 measures reflective of clinical activity in general practice. A substantial drop in activity was observed in all measures at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. By April 2021, the median rate had recovered to within 15% of the median rate in April 2019 in six measures. The remaining measures showed a sustained drop, ranging from a 18.5% reduction in medication reviews to a 42.0% reduction in blood pressure monitoring. Three measures continued to show a sustained drop by December 2021. <h4>Conclusions</h4>  The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a substantial change in primary care activity across the measures we developed, with recovery in most measures.

The usual row-wise encoding of the VCF data model (either as text or packed binary) emphasises efficient retrieval of all data for a given variant, but accessing data on a field or sample basis is inefficient. Biobank scale datasets currently available consist of hundreds of thousands of whole genomes and hundreds of terabytes of compressed VCF. Row-wise data storage is fundamentally unsuitable and a more scalable approach is needed. <h4>Results</h4> Zarr is a format for storing multi-dimensional data that is widely used across the sciences, and is ideally suited to massively parallel processing. We present the VCF Zarr specification, an encoding of the VCF data model using Zarr, along with fundamental software infrastructure for efficient and reliable conversion at scale. We show how this format is far more efficient than standard VCF based approaches, and competitive with specialised methods for storing genotype data in terms of compression ratios and single-threaded calculation performance. We present case studies on subsets of three large human datasets (Genomics England: n =78,195; Our Future Health: n =651,050; All of Us: n =245,394) along with whole genome datasets for Norway Spruce ( n =1,063) and SARS-CoV-2 ( n =4,484,157). We demonstrate the potential for VCF Zarr to enable a new generation of high-performance and cost-effective applications via illustrative examples using cloud computing and GPUs. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Large row-encoded VCF files are a major bottleneck for current research, and storing and processing these files incurs a substantial cost. The VCF Zarr specification, building on widely-used, open-source technologies has the potential to greatly reduce these costs, and may enable a diverse ecosystem of next-generation tools for analysing genetic variation data directly from cloud-based object stores, while maintaining compatibility with existing file-oriented workflows. <h4>Key Points</h4> VCF is widely supported, and the underlying data model entrenched in bioinformatics pipelines. The standard row-wise encoding as text (or binary) is inherently inefficient for large-scale data processing. The Zarr format provides an efficient solution, by encoding fields in the VCF separately in chunk-compressed binary format.",,doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.11.598241; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.11.598241; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR866116; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR866116&type=FILE&fileName=EMS196840-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Understanding the number of individuals at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness, and how this varies between countries may inform the design of possible strategies to shield those at highest risk. <h4>Methods</h4> We estimated the number of individuals at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease by age (5-year age groups), sex and country (n=188) based on prevalence data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study for 2017 and United Nations population estimates for 2020. We also calculated the number of individuals without an underlying condition that could be considered at-risk because of their age, using thresholds from 50-70 years. The list of underlying conditions relevant to COVID-19 disease was determined by mapping conditions listed in GBD to the guidelines published by WHO and public health agencies in the UK and US. We analysed data from two large multimorbidity studies to determine appropriate adjustment factors for clustering and multimorbidity. <h4>Results</h4> We estimate that 1.7 (1.0 - 2.4) billion individuals (22% [15-28%] of the global population) are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease. The share of the population at increased risk ranges from 16% in Africa to 31% in Europe. Chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and chronic respiratory disease (CRD) were the most prevalent conditions in males and females aged 50+ years. African countries with a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS and Island countries with a high prevalence of diabetes, also had a high share of the population at increased risk. The prevalence of multimorbidity (>1 underlying conditions) was three times higher in Europe than in Africa (10% vs 3%). <h4>Conclusion</h4> Based on current guidelines and prevalence data from GBD, we estimate that one in five individuals worldwide has a condition that is on the list of those at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease. However, for many of these individuals the underlying condition will be undiagnosed or not severe enough to be captured in health systems, and in some cases the increase in risk may be quite modest. There is an urgent need for robust analyses of the risks associated with different underlying conditions so that countries can identify the highest risk groups and develop targeted shielding policies to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, countries are considering policies of ‘shielding’ the most vulnerable, but there is currently very limited evidence on the number of individuals that might need to be shielded. Guidelines on who is currently believed to be at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness have been published online by the WHO and public health agencies in the UK and US. We searched PubMed (“Risk factors” AND “COVID-19”) without language restrictions, from database inception until April 5, 2020, and identified 62 studies published between Feb 15, 2020 and March 20, 2020. Evidence from China, Italy and the USA indicates that older individuals, males and those with underlying conditions, such as CVD, diabetes and CRD, are at greater risk of severe COVID-19 illness and death. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> This study combines evidence from large international databases and new analysis of large multimorbidity studies to inform policymakers about the number of individuals that may be at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness in different countries. We developed a tool for rapid assessments of the number and percentage of country populations that would need to be targeted under different shielding policies. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Quantifying how many and who is at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness is critical to help countries design more effective interventions to protect vulnerable individuals and reduce pressure on health systems.

Our findings are based on one CDR dataset describing inter-district movement in Ghana in 2021, produced using two different aggregation methodologies. One methodology, “all pairs,” is designed to retain long distance network connections while the other, “sequential” methodology is designed to accurately reflect the volume of travel between locations. We show how the choice of methodology feeds through models of human mobility to the predictions of a metapopulation SEIR model of disease transmission. We also show that this impact varies depending on the location of pathogen introduction and transmissibility. For central locations or highly transmissible diseases, we do not observe significant differences between aggregation methodologies on the predicted spread of disease. For less transmissible diseases or those introduced into remote locations, we find that the choice of aggregation methodology influences the speed of spatial spread as well as the size of the peak number of infections in individual districts. Our findings can help researchers and users of epidemiological models to understand how methodological choices at the level of model inputs may influence the results of models of infectious disease transmission, as well as the circumstances in which these choices do not alter model predictions. <h4>Author Summary</h4> Predicting the sub-national spread of infectious disease requires accurate measurements of inter-regional travel networks. Often, this information is derived from the patterns of mobile device connections to the cellular network. This travel data is then used as an input to epidemiological models of infection transmission, defining the likelihood that disease is “exported” between regions. In this paper, we use one mobile device dataset collected in Ghana in 2021, aggregated according to two different methodologies which represent different aspects of inter-regional travel. We show how the choice of aggregation methodology leads to different predicted epidemics, and highlight the conditions under which models of infection transmission may be influenced by methodological choices in the aggregation of travel data used to parameterize these models. For example, we show how aggregation methodology changes predicted epidemics for less-transmissible infections and under certain models of human movement. We also highlight areas of relative stability, where aggregation choices do not alter predicted epidemics, such as cases where an infection is highly transmissible or is introduced into a central location.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/01/28/2023.01.25.23285005.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.01.25.23285005; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR609122; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR609122&type=FILE&fileName=EMS163650-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

As restrictions began to ease, resurgences in transmission were targeted by geographically-limited interventions of various stringencies. Understanding the spatial scale of networks of human interaction, and how these networks change over time, is critical to inform interventions targeted at the most at-risk areas without unnecessarily restricting areas at low risk of resurgence. <h4>Methods</h4> We use detailed human mobility data aggregated from Facebook users to determine how the spatially-explicit network of movements changed before and during the lockdown period, in response to the easing of restrictions, and to the introduction of locally-targeted interventions. We also apply community detection techniques to the weighted, directed network of movements to identify geographically-explicit movement communities and measure the evolution of these community structures through time. <h4>Findings</h4> We found that the mobility network became more sparse and the number of mobility communities decreased under the national lockdown, a change that disproportionately affected long distance journeys central to the mobility network. We also found that the community structure of areas in which locally-targeted interventions were implemented following epidemic resurgence did not show reorganization of community structure but did show small decreases in indicators of travel outside of local areas. <h4>Interpretation</h4> We propose that communities detected using Facebook or other mobility data be used to assess the impact of spatially-targeted restrictions and may inform policymakers about the spatial extent of human movement patterns in the UK. These data are available in near real-time, allowing quantification of changes in the distribution of the population across the UK, as well as changes in travel patterns to inform our understanding of the impact of geographically-targeted interventions. <h4>Putting Research Into Context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> Large-scale intensive interventions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have been implemented globally, significantly affecting human movement patterns. Mobility data show spatially-explicit network structure, but it is not clear how that structure changed in response to national or locally-targeted interventions. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> We used daily mobility data aggregated from Facebook users to quantify changes in the travel network in the UK during the national lockdown, and in response to local interventions. We identified changes in human behaviour in response to interventions and identified the community structure inherent in these networks. This approach to understanding changes in the travel network can help quantify the extent of strongly connected communities of interaction and their relationship to the extent of spatially-explicit interventions. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> We show that spatial mobility data available in near real-time can give information on connectivity that can be used to understand the impact of geographically-targeted interventions and in the future, to inform spatially-targeted intervention strategies. <h4>Data Sharing</h4> Data used in this study are available from the Facebook Data for Good Partner Program by application.

Management of risk in care homes requires good evidence on the most important transmission pathways. One hypothesised route at the start of the pandemic, prior to widespread testing, was transfer of patients from hospitals, which were experiencing high levels of nosocomial events. <h4>Methods</h4> We tested the hypothesis that hospital discharge events increased the intensity of care home cases using a national individually linked health record cohort in Wales, UK. We monitored 186,772 hospital discharge events over the period March to July 2020, tracking individuals to 923 care homes and recording the daily case rate in the homes populated by 15,772 residents. We estimated the risk of an increase in cases rates following exposure to a hospital discharge using multi-level hierarchical logistic regression, and a novel stochastic Hawkes process outbreak model. <h4>Findings</h4> In regression analysis, after adjusting for care home size, we found no significant association between hospital discharge and subsequent increases in care home case numbers (odds ratio: 0.99, 95% CI 0.82, 1.90). Risk factors for increased cases included care home size, care home resident density, and provision of nursing care. Using our outbreak model, we found a significant effect of hospital discharge on the subsequent intensity of cases. However, the effect was small, and considerably less than the effect of care home size, suggesting the highest risk of introduction came from interaction with the community. We estimated approximately 1.8% of hospital discharged patients may have been infected. <h4>Interpretation</h4> There is growing evidence in the UK that the risk of transfer of COVID-19 from the high-risk hospital setting to the high-risk care home setting during the early stages of the pandemic was relatively small. Although access to testing was limited to initial symptomatic cases in each care home at this time, our results suggest that reduced numbers of discharges, selection of patients, and action taken within care homes following transfer all may have contributed to mitigation. The precise key transmission routes from the community remain to be quantified.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/03/20/2021.03.18.21253443.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.18.21253443; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR300885; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR300885&type=FILE&fileName=EMS120474-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Real-time data are needed to quantify direct and indirect effects. We aimed to monitor hospital activity for presentation, diagnosis and treatment of CVDs during the pandemic to inform on indirect effects. <h4>Methods</h4> We analysed aggregate data on presentations, diagnoses and treatments or procedures for selected CVDs (acute coronary syndromes, heart failure, stroke and transient ischaemic attack, venous thromboembolism, peripheral arterial disease and aortic aneurysm) in UK hospitals before and during the COVID-19 epidemic. We produced an online visualisation tool to enable near real-time monitoring of trends. <h4>Findings</h4> Nine hospitals across England and Scotland contributed hospital activity data from 28 Oct 2019 (pre-COVID-19) to 10 May 2020 (pre-easing of lockdown), and for the same weeks during 2018-2019. Across all hospitals, total admissions and emergency department (ED) attendances decreased after lockdown (23 March 2020) by 57.9% (57.1-58.6%) and 52.9% (52.2-53.5%) respectively compared with the previous year. Activity for cardiac, cerebrovascular and other vascular conditions started to decline 1-2 weeks before lockdown, and fell by 31-88% after lockdown, with the greatest reductions observed for coronary artery bypass grafts, carotid endarterectomy, aortic aneurysm repair and peripheral arterial disease procedures. Compared with before the first UK COVID-19 (31 January 2020), activity declined across diseases and specialties between the first case and lockdown (total ED attendances RR 0.94, 0.93-0.95; total hospital admissions RR 0.96, 0.95-0.97) and after lockdown (attendances RR 0.63, 0.62-0.64; admissions RR 0.59, 0.57-0.60). There was limited recovery towards usual levels of some activities from mid-April 2020. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Substantial reductions in total and cardiovascular activities are likely to contribute to a major burden of indirect effects of the pandemic, suggesting they should be monitored and mitigated urgently. <h4>Funding</h4> British Heart Foundation, Health Data Research UK",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/07/11/2020.07.10.20151118.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.10.20151118; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR186560; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR186560&type=FILE&fileName=EMS87270-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

This study aimed to increase power in PND GWAS and explore its genetic architecture. We meta-analysed an existing study by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) with data from the GLAD+ study and UK Biobank (UKB), yielding 25,452 PND cases and 72,131 controls. Linkage disequilibrium score (LDSC) regression was used to compare genetic correlation profiles of PND and general MDD across traits. Gene, gene-set, and tissue expression analyses were also performed. The genetic correlation between PGC PND and UKB-GLAD+ PND was high (0.93). No genome-wide significant loci emerged from the meta-analysis. The SNP-based heritability of PND on the liability scale was 0.089. PND and MDD displayed broadly similar genetic correlation patterns. Still, PND had a significantly higher genetic correlation with anxiety disorders, while MDD showed higher correlations with cannabis use disorder, bipolar disorder, and ADHD. Tissue expression analysis showed the highest enrichment in brain regions like the cortex and nucleus accumbens. The sample size was not large enough to detect genome-wide significant loci, and further analyses in ancestrally diverse datasets are needed. PND definitions were heterogeneous, and precise information on onset timing across studies was lacking. This study, the largest European ancestry meta-analysis of PND to date, suggests distinct genetic factors may differentiate PND from MDD in general. The findings highlight the need for larger and more ancestrally diverse studies to identify genome-wide significant loci.",,doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.23.25340751; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR1125111; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR1125111&type=FILE&fileName=EMS211132-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We sought to examine the relationship between ethnic background and (1) hospital admission for severe COVID-19; (2) in-hospital mortality. <h4>Methods</h4> We conducted a case-control study of 872 inner city adult residents admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 (cases) and 3,488 matched controls randomly sampled from a primary healthcare database comprising 344,083 people resident in the same region. To examine in-hospital mortality, we conducted a cohort study of 1827 adults consecutively admitted with COVID-19. Data collected included hospital admission for COVID-19, demographics, comorbidities, in-hospital mortality. The primary exposure variable was self-defined ethnicity. <h4>Results</h4> The 872 cases comprised 48.1% Black, 33.7% White, 12.6% Mixed/Other and 5.6% Asian patients. In conditional logistic regression analyses, Black and Mixed/Other ethnicity were associated with higher admission risk than white (OR 3.12 [95% CI 2.63-3.71] and 2.97 [2.30-3.85] respectively). Adjustment for comorbidities and deprivation modestly attenuated the association (OR 2.28 [1.87-2.79] for Black, 2.66 [2.01-3.52] for Mixed/Other). Asian ethnicity was not associated with higher admission risk (OR 1.20 [0.86-1.66]). In the cohort study of 1827 patients, 455 (28.9%) died over a median (IQR) of 8 (4-16) days. Age and male sex, but not Black (adjusted HR 0.84 [0.63-1.11]) or Mixed/Other ethnicity (adjusted HR 0.69 [0.43-1.10]), were associated with in-hospital mortality. Asian ethnicity was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (adjusted HR 1.54 [0.98-2.41]). <h4>Conclusions</h4> Black and Mixed ethnicity are independently associated with greater admission risk with COVID-19 and may be risk factors for development of severe disease. Comorbidities and socioeconomic factors only partly account for this and additional ethnicity-related factors may play a large role. The impact of COVID-19 may be different in Asians. <h4>Funding sources</h4> British Heart Foundation (CH/1999001/11735 and RE/18/2/34213 to AMS); the National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre (NIHR BRC) at Guy’s & St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust and King’s College London (IS-BRC-1215-20006); and the NIHR BRC at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and King’s College London (IS-BRC-1215-20018).",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/07/10/2020.07.08.20148965.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.08.20148965; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR185844; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR185844&type=FILE&fileName=EMS87258-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

However, the scale of the problem is unquantified, impeding development of effective mitigations. We asked what has happened to general practice contacts for acute physical and mental health outcomes during the pandemic? <h4>Methods</h4> Using electronic health records from the Clinical Research Practice Datalink (CPRD) Aurum (2017-2020), we calculated weekly primary care contacts for selected acute physical and mental health conditions (including: anxiety, depression, acute alcohol-related events, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] exacerbations, cardiovascular and diabetic emergencies). We used interrupted time series (ITS) analysis to formally quantify changes in conditions after the introduction of population-wide restrictions (‘lockdown’) compared to the period prior to their introduction in March 2020. <h4>Findings</h4> The overall population included 9,863,903 individuals on 1 st January 2017. Primary care contacts for all conditions dropped dramatically after introduction of population-wide restrictions. By July 2020, except for unstable angina and acute alcohol-related events, contacts for all conditions had not recovered to pre-lockdown levels. The largest reductions were for contacts for: diabetic emergencies (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.25-0.50), depression (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.52-0.53), and self-harm (OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.54-0.58). <h4>Interpretation</h4> There were substantial reductions in primary care contacts for acute physical and mental conditions with restrictions, with limited recovery by July 2020. It is likely that much of the deficit in care represents unmet need, with implications for subsequent morbidity and premature mortality. The conditions we studied are sufficiently severe that any unmet need will have substantial ramifications for the people experiencing the conditions and healthcare provision. Maintaining access must be a key priority in future public health planning (including further restrictions). <h4>Funding</h4> Wellcome Trust Senior Fellowship (SML), Health Data Research UK. <h4>RESULTS IN CONTEXT</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> A small study in 47 GP practices in a largely deprived, urban area of the UK (Salford) reported that primary care consultations for four broad diagnostic groups (circulatory disease, common mental health problems, type 2 diabetes mellitus and malignant cancer) declined by 16-50% between March and May 2020, compared to what was expected based on data from January 2010 to March 2020. We searched Medline for other relevant evidence of the indirect effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical and mental health from inception to September 25 th 2020, for articles published in English, with titles including the search terms (“covid*” or “coronavirus” or “sars-cov-2”), and title or abstracts including the search terms (“indirect impact” or “missed diagnos*” or “missing diagnos*” or “delayed diagnos*” or ((“present*” or “consult*” or “engag*” or “access*”) AND (“reduction” or “decrease” or “decline”)). We found no further studies investigating the change in primary care contacts for specific physical- and mental-health conditions indirectly resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or its control measures. There has been a reduction in hospital admissions and presentations to accident and emergency departments in the UK, particularly for myocardial infarctions and cerebrovascular accidents. However, there is no published evidence specifically investigating the changes in primary care contacts for severe acute physical and mental health conditions. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> To our knowledge this is the first study to explore changes in healthcare contacts for acute physical and mental health conditions in a large population representative of the UK. We used electronic primary care health records of nearly 10 million individuals across the UK to investigate the indirect impact of COVID-19 on primary care contacts for mental health, acute alcohol-related events, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, and cardiovascular and diabetic emergencies up to July 2020. For all conditions studied, we found primary care contacts dropped dramatically following the introduction of population-wide restriction measures in March 2020. By July 2020, with the exception of unstable angina and acute alcohol-related events, primary care contacts for all conditions studied had not recovered to pre-lockdown levels. In the general population, estimates of the absolute reduction in the number of primary care contacts up to July 2020, compared to what we would expect from previous years varied from fewer than 10 contacts per million for some cardiovascular outcomes, to 12,800 per million for depression and 6,600 for anxiety. In people with COPD, we estimated there were 43,900 per million fewer contacts for COPD exacerbations up to July 2020 than what we would expect from previous years. <h4>Implicatins of all the available evidence</h4> While our results may represent some genuine reduction in disease frequency (e.g. the restriction measures may have improved diabetic glycaemic control due to more regular daily routines at home), it is more likely the reduced primary care conatcts we saw represent a substantial burden of unmet need (particularly for mental health conditions) that may be reflected in subsequent increased mortality and morbidity. Health service providers should take steps to prepare for increased demand in the coming months and years due to the short and longterm ramifications of reduced access to care for severe acute physical and mental health conditions.

We estimated individual rates of weight gain before and during the pandemic, and identified individuals with rapid weight gain (>0·5kg/m 2 /year) in each period. We also estimated the change in rate of weight gain between the prepandemic and pandemic period and defined extreme-accelerators as the ten percent of individuals with the greatest increase (>1·84kg/m 2 /year). We estimated associations with these outcomes using multivariate logistic regression. <h4>Findings</h4> We extracted data on 17,742,365 adults (50·1% female, 76·1% White British).

Amongst the groups identified as being at increased risk from COVID-19 are healthcare workers (HCWs) and ethnic minority groups. Emerging evidence suggests HCWs from ethnic minority groups are at increased risk of adverse COVID-19-related physical and mental health outcomes. To date there has been no large-scale analysis of these risks in UK healthcare workers or ancillary workers in healthcare settings, stratified by ethnicity or occupation type, and adjusted for potential confounders. This paper reports the protocol for a prospective longitudinal questionnaire study of UK HCWs, as part of the UK-REACH programme (The United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity And COVID-19 outcomes in Healthcare workers). <h4>Methods and analysis</h4> A baseline questionnaire with follow-up questionnaires at 4 and 8 months will be administered to a national cohort of UK healthcare workers and ancillary workers in healthcare settings, and those registered with UK healthcare regulators. With consent, data will be linked to health records, and participants followed up for 25 years. Univariate associations between ethnicity and primary outcome measures (clinical COVID-19 outcomes, and physical and mental health) and key confounders/explanatory variables will be tested, followed by multivariable analyses to test for associations between ethnicity and key outcomes adjusted for the confounder/explanatory variables, with interactions included as appropriate. Using follow-up data, multilevel models will be used to model changes over time by ethnic group, facilitating understanding of absolute and relative risks in different ethnic groups, and generalisability of findings. <h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4> The study is approved by Health Research Authority (reference 20/HRA/4718), and carries minimal risk to participants. We aim to manage the small risk of participant distress due to being asked questions on sensitive topics by clearly indicating on the participant information sheet that the questionnaire covers sensitive topics and that participants are under no obligation to answer these, or indeed any other, questions, and by providing links to support organisations. Results will be disseminated with reports to Government and papers uploaded to pre-print servers and submitted to peer reviewed journals. <h4>Registration details</h4> Trial ID: ISRCTN11811602 <h4>STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY</h4> National, UK-wide, study, aiming to capture variety of healthcare worker job roles including ancillary workers in healthcare settings.

Yet methodology for codelist generation varies, manifesting in misclassification bias, while there are drug-specific codelist considerations. <h4>Materials and Methods</h4> We developed methods to generate drug codelists, testing this using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Aurum database, accounting for missing data in “attribute” search variables. We generated codelists for 1)cardiovascular disease and 2)inhaled Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) therapies, applying them to a sample cohort of 335,931 COPD patients. We compared searching on all search variables (A,”gold standard”) to B) chemical and C) ontological information only. <h4>Results</h4> In Search A we determined 165,150 patients prescribed cardiovascular drugs(49.2% of cohort), and 317,963 prescribed COPD inhalers (94.7% of cohort).

Yet methods to create drug codelists are inconsistent, may not include physician expertise, nor be reported. We developed a reproducible method to create drug codelists, testing it using de-identified healthcare records. We generated codelists for 1) heart conditions and 2) inhalers to identify prescriptions in a sample group of 335,931 patients with chronic lung disease. We compared our full methods (Search A) to two restricted searches to show prescriptions can be missed if necessary considerations are not made. In search A, we determined 165,150 people (49.2% of sample group) prescribed drugs from the heart codelist. For lung inhalers, we determined 317,963 prescriptions (94.7% of group). Search C missed substantial prescriptions, for drugs lowering blood pressure by opening vessels (A and B:19,696 prescriptions; C: 1,145), and short-term inhalers opening airways (A and B: 35,310; C:564). We recommend full methods(A) for completeness. Drug codelist methods must be consistent, duplicable, and include physician input at all research stages, and have special considerations including status (eg, new, taken off market), disease, and drug categorical system.

There was some evidence of a higher rate of all-cause hospitalisations in the control arm (incidence rate ratio 1.12, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.25; p = 0.05), but no differences in other outcomes. The process evaluation found the intervention was largely delivered as intended and proved acceptable to most participants. The economic analysis showed HOPE plus usual care costs of GB£1,401 with 0.024 QALY improvement compared to the control. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio GB£58,375. <h4>Limitations</h4> The HERO trial was delivered during especially challenging circumstances that included the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined outcomes taking account of this but detected no difference in primary or secondary outcomes, providing reassurance that COVID-19 was unlikely to have influenced trial results. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Based on our findings, we do not recommend routine commissioning of extended rehabilitation for older people with frailty after discharge home from hospital or intermediate care, following an acute admission with a medical illness or injury. <h4>Trial registration</h4> ISRCTN-13927531 (19/04/2017).",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2025/06/18/2025.06.17.25329580.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.06.17.25329580; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR1039029; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR1039029&type=FILE&fileName=EMS206581-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

The use of visible TB infection prevention and control (IPC) measures, such as masks or isolation, can contribute to stigma. Methods  To explore stigma in this condition, we conducted in-depth individual interviews with 18 health workers and 15 patients in the rural Eastern Cape of South Africa using a semi-structured interview guide and narrative approach. We used reflexive thematic analysis and applied Link and Phelan’s theoretical model of stigma. Results  Participants shared poignant narratives of TB stigma, often entailing TB IPC, with some feeling ‘less than human’. We found TB IPC measures sometimes exacerbated stigma, for example through introducing physical isolation that became prolonged, or through a mask marking the person out as being ill with TB. In this context, stigma emerged from the narrow definition of what mask-wearing symbolises, in contrast with broader uses of masks as a preventative measure. In this way, the health facility itself was shown to play an important role in generating and perpetuating IPC related stigma. We applied ‘ubuntu’ as African humanist conceptual framework to develop recommendations of how TB IPC implementation could be destigmatised. Conclusion  Health facilities may unwittingly perpetuate stigma, but they also have the potential to reduce it. Ubuntu emphases shared humanity and collective wellbeing and could engage with some of the deep-rooted contributors to TB stigma. An ubuntu-informed approach could underpin a local policy change to universal masking, thereby destigmatising an important IPC practice.</p>",,pdf:https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3568389/latest.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3568389/v1; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR755427; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR755427&type=FILE&fileName=EMS191184-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

The objective was to describe the relationship between diabetes and all-cause in-hospital mortality in adults, using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, obesity, and other comorbidities. The primary analysis was restricted to a subset with sufficiently complete comorbidity status recording. Several sensitivity analyses, including on the unrestricted dataset, were carried out to verify the results.  <br><br>Findings:  Diabetes was independently associated with mortality in people admitted to critical care settings with COVID-19 in England; the proportion of 30-day mortality attributable to diabetes, after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, obesity, and other comorbidities, was 4·8% (95%CI 2·5-7·0). 14,639 COVID-19 related HDU and ICU admissions were reported during the study period, of which 6,142 were included in primary analysis, including 3,311 HDU (mean age 72), and 2,831 ICU admissions (mean age 58). 1,439 (23·4%) had diabetes. 1,847 individuals (30·1%) died during the study period. 30 day mortality was higher in people with diabetes than without (p < 0·001). People with diabetes were at increased risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1·28 [1·14, 1·42]).

We investigated the sensitivity of R t estimates to different data sources representing Covid-19 in England, and we explored how this sensitivity could track epidemic dynamics in population sub-groups. We sourced public data on test-positive cases, hospital admissions, and deaths with confirmed Covid-19 in seven regions of England over March through August 2020. We estimated R t using a model that mapped unobserved infections to each data source. We then compared differences in R t with the demographic and social context of surveillance data over time. Our estimates of transmission potential varied for each data source, with the relative inconsistency of estimates varying across regions and over time. R t estimates based on hospital admissions and deaths were more spatio-temporally synchronous than when compared to estimates from all test-positives. We found these differences may be linked to biased representations of subpopulations in each data source. These included spatially clustered testing, and where outbreaks in hospitals, care homes, and young age groups reflected the link between age and severity of disease.

Following a qualitative phase to identify signs, symptoms and risk factors, we sought to develop and validate two COVID-19-specific risk prediction scores RECAP-GP (without peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2)) and RECAP-O2 (with SpO2). <h4>Methods</h4> Prospective cohort study using multivariable logistic regression for model development. Data on signs and symptoms (model predictors) were collected on community-based patients with suspected COVID-19 via primary care electronic health records systems and linked with secondary data on hospital admission (primary outcome) within 28 days of symptom onset. Data sources: RECAP-GP: Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) primary care practices (development), Northwest London (NWL) primary care practices, NHS COVID-19 Clinical Assessment Service (CCAS) (validation). RECAP-O2: Doctaly Assist platform (development, and validation in subsequent sample). Estimated sample size was 2,880 per model. <h4>Findings</h4> Data were available from 8,311 individuals. Observations, such SpO2, were mostly missing in NWL, RSC, and CCAS data; however, SpO2 was available for around 70% of Doctaly patients. In the final predictive models, RECAP-GP included sex, age, degree of breathlessness, temperature symptoms, and presence of hypertension (Area Under the Curve (AUC): 0.802, Validation Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of ‘low risk’ 98.8%. RECAP-O2 included age, degree of breathlessness, fatigue, and SpO2 at rest (AUC: 0.843), Validation NPV of ‘low risk’ 99.4%. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Both RECAP models are a valid tool in the assessment of COVID-19 patients in the community. RECAP-GP can be used initially, without need for observations, to identify patients who require monitoring. If the patient is monitored at home and SpO2 is available, RECAP-O2 is useful to assess the need for further treatment escalation. <h4>Research in context panel</h4> <h4>Evidence before the study</h4> This study was conceived during the first COVID-19 wave in the UK (March - April 2020), as members of the research team contributed to the development of national clinical guidelines for COVID-19 management in the community and to the Oxford COVID-19 rapid review to track signs and symptoms of COVID-19 internationally. The review was carried out according to Cochrane Collaboration standards for rapid reviews and identified systematic reviews and large-scale observational studies describing the signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Evidence gathered showed worsening of COVID-19 symptoms around the 7th day of disease and challenges in identifying patients with higher likelihood of severity to increase their monitoring. To this end, tools such NEWS2 have been used in the UK to assess COVID-19 patients in primary care, but they do not capture the characteristics of COVID-19 infection and/or are not suitable for community remote assessment. Several COVID-19 risk scores have been developed. QCOVID provides a risk of mortality considering patients’ existing risk factors but does not include acute signs and symptoms. ISARIC 4C Deterioration model has been specifically developed for hospital settings. In England, the NHS has implemented the Oximetry @home strategy to monitor patients with acute COVID-19 deemed at risk (older than 64 years old or with comorbidities) by providing pulse oximeters; however, the criteria for monitoring or for escalation of care have not been validated. There is, therefore, the need to develop a risk prediction score to establish COVID-19 patients’ risk of deterioration to be used in the community for both face to face or remote consultation. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> We developed and validated two COVID-19 specific risk prediction scores. One to be used in the initial remote assessment of patients with acute COVID-19 to assess need for monitoring (RECAP-GP). The second one to assess the need for further treatment escalation and includes peripheral saturation of oxygen among the model predictors (RECAP-O2). To our knowledge, this is the first COVID-19 specific risk prediction score to assess and monitor COVID-19 patients’ risk of deterioration remotely. This will be a valuable resource to complement the use of oximetry in the community clinical decision-making when assessing a patient with acute COVID-19. <h4>Implications of all available evidence</h4> To manage pandemic waves and their demand on healthcare, acute COVID-19 patients require close monitoring in the community and prompt escalation of their treatment. Guidance available so far relies on unvalidated tools and clinician judgement to assess deterioration. COVID-19 specific community-based risk prediction scores such as RECAP may contribute to reducing the uncertainty in the assessment and monitoring of COVID-19 patients, increase safety in clinical practice and improve outcomes by facilitating appropriate treatment escalation.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/12/25/2021.12.23.21268279.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.23.21268279; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR436245; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.23.21268279

Previous research indicates that ethnic minority healthcare workers (HCWs), those on visas, and in junior roles, were more likely to be redeployed to COVID-19 duties compared to White UK-born HCWs. There is limited evidence on how redeployment was practically organized, preparedness of HCWs and the NHS for rapid changes, and the decision-making processes involved. This paper discusses HCWs’ redeployment experiences, their alignment with NHS policy for deploying staff safely, and potential links to staff attrition. Methods  As part of the United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity And COVID-19 outcomes among Healthcare workers, we conducted a qualitative sub-study, between December 2020 and July 2021, consisting of interviews and focus groups with 164 HCWs from different ethnicities, genders, job roles, migration statuses, and UK regions. Sessions were conducted online or by telephone, recorded, transcribed and analysed with participants’ consent. We utilised the breadth-and-depth approach, initially identifying transcripts mentioning redeployment or changes in work patterns, followed by an in-depth thematic analysis. Results  Of the 164 HCWs, 22 (13.4%) reported redeployment to a new role, while 42 (26.8%) reported changes in their working patterns. Redeployment experiences varied based on HCWs’ workplaces, skillsets, input into decisions, and perceived risks. Four themes were identified: 1. redeployment and the changing nature of work, 2. pandemic (un)preparedness, 3. redeployment decision-making, and 4. risk assessments in the context of redeployment. Our data revealed the practical realities of redeployment, including discrepancies between the NHS policy and actual practices, particularly early deployment without adequate training and supervision. The lack of planning and preparedness had an operational and emotional impact on HCWs, affecting their morale. Lastly, some HCWs felt disempowered and undervalued due to a lack of agency in redeployment decisions Conclusion  This study highlights HCWs’ redeployment experiences during COVID-19, the conditions under which it occurred, and its impacts. The findings, although rooted in the pandemic, remain relevant for addressing staffing challenges in the healthcare workforce.

Participants: 6,686 adults admitted to an ICU in England between 2nd April and 1st December, 2020 (inclusive), with presumed or confirmed COVID-19, for whom data was submitted to the national surveillance programme and met study inclusion criteria.  Interventions: N/A  Main Outcomes and Measures: A Bayesian hierarchical approach was used to model the association between hospital trust level (mechanical ventilation compatible) bed occupancy, and in-hospital all-cause mortality. Results were adjusted for unit characteristics (pre-pandemic size), individual patient-level demographic characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity, time-to-ICU admission), and recorded chronic comorbidities (obesity, diabetes, respiratory disease, liver disease, heart disease, hypertension, immunosuppression, neurological disease, renal disease). <h4>Results:</h4> 121,151 patient-days were observed, with a mortality rate of 20.8 per 1,000 patient days. Adjusting for patient-level factors, mortality was higher for admissions during periods of high occupancy (>85% occupancy versus the baseline of 45 to 85%) [OR 1.18 (95% posterior credible interval (PCI): 1.00 to 1.38)]. In contrast, mortality was decreased for admissions during periods of low occupancy (<45% relative to the baseline) [OR 0.79 (95% PCI: 0.69 to 0.90)].  Conclusion and Relevance: Increasing occupancy of beds compatible with mechanical ventilation, a proxy for operational strain, is associated with a higher mortality risk for individuals admitted to ICU. Public health interventions (such as expeditious vaccination programmes and non-pharmaceutical interventions) to control both incidence and prevalence of COVID-19, and therefore keep ICU occupancy low in the context of the pandemic, are necessary to mitigate the impact of this type of resource saturation.

The NHS in England stopped most non-urgent work by March 2020, but later recommended that services should be restored to near-normal levels before winter where possible. The authors are developing the OpenSAFELY NHS Service Restoration Observatory , using data to describe changes in service activity during COVID-19, and reviewing signals for action with commissioners, researchers and clinicians. Here we report phase one: generating, managing, and describing the data. <h4>Objective</h4> To describe the volume and variation of coded clinical activity in English primary care across 23.8 million patients’ records, taking respiratory disease and laboratory procedures as key examples. <h4>Methods</h4> Working on behalf of NHS England we developed an open source software framework for data management and analysis to describe trends and variation in clinical activity across primary care EHR data on 23.8 million patients; and conducted a population cohort-based study to describe activity using CTV3 coding hierarchy and keyword searches from January 2019-September 2020. <h4>Results</h4> Much activity recorded in general practice declined to some extent during the pandemic, but largely recovered by September 2020, with some exceptions. There was a large drop in coded activity for commonly used laboratory tests, with broad recovery to pre-pandemic levels by September. One exception was blood coagulation tests such as International Normalised Ratio (INR), with a smaller reduction (median tests per 1000 patients in 2020: February 8.0; April 6.2; September 7.0). The overall pattern of recording for respiratory symptoms was less affected, following an expected seasonal pattern and classified as “no change” from the previous year. Respiratory tract infections exhibited a sustained drop compared with pre-pandemic levels, not returning to pre-pandemic levels by September 2020. Various COVID-19 codes increased through the period. We observed a small decline associated with high level codes for long-term respiratory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Asthma annual reviews experienced a small drop but since recovered, while COPD annual reviews remain below baseline. <h4>Conclusions</h4> We successfully delivered an open source software framework to describe trends and variation in clinical activity across an unprecedented scale of primary care data. The COVD-19 pandemic led to a substantial change in healthcare activity. Most laboratory tests showed substantial reduction, largely recovering to near-normal levels by September 2020, with some important tests less affected. Records of respiratory infections decreased with the exception of codes related to COVID-19, whilst activity of other respiratory disease codes was mixed.

The COVID-19 pandemic impacted antibiotic prescribing for common bacterial infections. This highlights the need to examine risk of hospital admissions related to common infections, excluding COVID-19 infections during the pandemic. <h4>Methods</h4> With the approval of NHS England, we accessed electronic health records from The Phoenix Partnership (TPP) through OpenSAFELY platform. We included patients with primary care diagnosis of common infections, including lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), and lower urinary tract infection (UTI), from January 2019 to August 2022. We excluded patients with a COVID-19 record 90 days before to 30 days after the infection diagnosis. Using Cox proportional-hazard regression models, we predicted risk of infection-related hospital admission in 30 days follow-up period after the diagnosis. <h4>Results</h4> We found 12,745,165 infection diagnoses from January 2019 to August 2022. Of them, 80,395 (2.05%) cases were admitted to hospital in the follow-up period. Counts of hospital admission for infections dropped during COVID-19, e.g., LRTI from 3,950 in December 2019 to 520 in April 2020. Comparing those prescribed an antibiotic to those without, reduction in risk of hospital admission were largest with LRTI (adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.35; 95% CI, 0.35-0.36) and UTI (adjusted OR 0.45; 95% CI, 0.44-0.46), compared to URTI (adjusted OR 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03-1.06). <h4>Conclusion</h4> Large effectiveness of antibiotics in preventing complications related to LRTI and UTI can support better targeting of antibiotics to patients with higher complication risks. <h4>Key messages</h4> - The main drivers of infection-related hospital admission are age, Charlson comorbidity index, and history of prior antibiotics. - Antibiotics are more effective in preventing hospital admission related to infections such as lower respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection, rather than upper respiratory tract infection. - Common antibiotic types are associated with more reduction in the risk of infection-related hospital admission.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/07/18/2023.07.16.23292723.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.16.23292723; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR693212; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR693212&type=FILE&fileName=EMS181508-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We evaluate whether these measures might be sufficient to control the epidemic by estimating their impact on the reproduction number ( R 0 , the average number of secondary cases generated per case). <h4>Methods</h4> We asked a representative sample of UK adults about their contact patterns on the previous day. The questionnaire documents the age and location of contacts and as well as a measure of their intimacy (whether physical contact was made or not). In addition, we asked about adherence to different physical distancing measures. The first surveys were sent on Tuesday 24th March, one day after a “ lockdown” was implemented across the UK. We compared measured contact patterns during the “ lockdown” to patterns of social contact made during a non-epidemic period. By comparing these, we estimated the change in reproduction number as a consequence of the physical distancing measures imposed. We used a meta-analysis of published estimates to inform our estimates of the reproduction number before interventions were put in place. <h4>Findings</h4> We found a 73% reduction in the average daily number of contacts observed per participant (from 10.2 to 2.9). This would be sufficient to reduce R 0 from 2.6 prior to lockdown to 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37 - 0.89) after the lockdown, based on all types of contact and 0.37 (95% CI = 0.22 - 0.53) for physical contacts only. <h4>Interpretation</h4> The physical distancing measures adopted by the UK public have substantially reduced contact levels and will likely lead to a substantial impact and a decline in cases in the coming weeks. However, this projected decline in incidence will not occur immediately as there are significant delays between infection, the onset of symptomatic disease and hospitalisation, as well as further delays to these events being reported. Tracking behavioural change can give a more rapid assessment of the impact of physical distancing measures than routine epidemiological surveillance. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> Many governments have adopted physical distancing measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is unclear to what extent these measures reduce the number of contacts and therefore transmission. We searched PubMed and medRxiv on March 28, 2020, with the terms “ (coronavirus OR COVID-19 OR influenza) AND ((school OR work) AND (closure OR holiday)) AND (contact OR mixing)” and identified 59 and 17 results, respectively. Only one study conducted in China during the COVID-19 pandemic reported a reduction in daily contacts outside the home during the period of “ lockdown”. We found no other published articles that empirically quantify the impact of these measures on age- and location-specific mixing patterns. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> By surveying adults’ behaviour in the UK during a period of stringent physical distancing (“ lockdown”) and comparing the results to previously collected data, we found a large reduction in daily contacts particularly outside the home, resulting in a marked reduction in the estimated reproduction number from 2.6 to 0.62 (95% bootstrapped confidence interval [CI] 0.37 - 0.89). This method allows for rapid assessment of changes in the reproduction number that is unaffected by reporting delays. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Changes in human contact behaviour drive respiratory infection rates. Understanding these changes at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic allows us to rapidly quantify the impact of physical distancing measures on the transmission of pathogens.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/04/03/2020.03.31.20049023.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.20049023; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR138670; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR138670&type=FILE&fileName=EMS89599-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Such interventions were key components in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents findings from the qualitative component of an evaluation of an implementation of the HealthCall Digital Care Homes application, across sites in northern England. The implementation commenced prior to the pandemic and continued throughout. Semi-structured, qualitative interviews were held with stakeholders. Interviews were conducted remotely (October 2020 -June 2021). Data were analysed via a reflexive thematic analysis then mapped against Normalization Process Theory (NPT) constructs (coherence, collective action, cognitive participation, and reflexive monitoring) providing a framework to assess implementation success. Thirty-five participants were recruited: 16 care home staff, six NHS community nurses, five relatives of care home residents, four HealthCall team members, three care home residents, and one local authority commissioner. Despite facing challenges such as apprehension towards digital technology among care home staff, the application was viewed positively across stakeholder groups. The HealthCall team maintained formal and informal feedback loop with stakeholders. This resulted in revisions to the intervention and implementation. Appropriate training and problem solving from the HealthCall team and buy-in from care home and NHS staff were key to achieving success across NPT constructs. While this implementation appears broadly successful, establishing rapport and maintaining ongoing support requires significant time, financial backing, and the right individuals in place across stakeholder groups to drive implementation and intervention evolution. The digital literacy of care home staff requires encouragement to enhance their readiness for digital interventions. The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed this agenda forward. Problems with stability across the workforce within care homes need to be addressed to avoid skill loss and support embeddedness of digital interventions. <h4>What is known about this topic?</h4> Improving healthcare delivery in UK care homes is a health policy priority. Digital interventions designed to enhance the referral process between care homes and NHS services and improve the healthcare delivery in care homes have become increasingly common in the UK. The HealthCall Digital Care Homes application is one such intervention. These interventions and their implementations require evaluation to ensure that they operate as intended, function coherently and are considered appropriate and legitimate to the care home setting. <h4>What this paper adds?</h4> The HealthCall Digital Care Homes app is a feasible, appropriate and legitimate intervention for referral, triage and health care support for non-urgent health care needs of care home residents. The ongoing involvement of end users in further developing the intervention, and the level of monitoring and support provided by the implementation team appears to be key to the implementation’s success.

We performed Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by post-hoc Dunns tests to assess differences in these features among baseline, pre-, and during-lockdown periods. We also studied behavioural differences by age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and educational background. We were able to quantify expected changes in time spent at home, distance travelled, and the number of nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices between pre- and during-lockdown periods. We saw reduced sociality as measured through mobility features, and increased virtual sociality through phone usage. People were more active on their phones, spending more time using social media apps, particularly around major news events. Furthermore, participants had lower heart rate, went to bed later, and slept more. We also found that young people had longer homestay than older people during lockdown and fewer daily steps.

Using a 14-day wear protocol, wrist-worn accelerometers were sent to participants after a five-month follow-up assessment. Acute illness severity was assessed by the WHO clinical progression scale, and the severity of ongoing symptoms was assessed using four previously reported data-driven clinical recovery clusters. Two existing control populations of office workers and type 2 diabetes were comparators. <h4>Results</h4> Valid accelerometer data from 253 women and 462 men were included.

However, systematic studies exploring the breadth of medical diagnoses, including common, but non-fatal diseases are scarce, but may help to understand severe COVID-19 among patients at supposedly low risk. Here, we systematically harmonized >12 million primary care and hospitalisation health records from ∼500,000 UK Biobank participants into 1448 collated disease terms to systematically identify diseases predisposing to severe COVID-19 (requiring hospitalisation or death) and its post-acute sequalae, Long COVID. We identified a total of 679 diseases associated with an increased risk for severe COVID-19 (n=672) and/or Long COVID (n=72) that spanned almost all clinical specialties and were strongly enriched in clusters of cardio-respiratory and endocrine-renal diseases. For 57 diseases, we established consistent evidence to predispose to severe COVID-19 based on survival and genetic susceptibility analyses. This included a possible role of symptoms of malaise and fatigue as a so far largely overlooked risk factor for severe COVID-19. We finally observed partially opposing risk estimates at known risk loci for severe COVID-19 for etiologically related diseases, such as post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis (e.g., MUC5B , NPNT , and PSMD3 ) or rheumatoid arthritis (e.g., TYK2 ), possibly indicating a segregation of disease mechanisms. Our results provide a unique reference that demonstrates how 1) complex co-occurrence of multiple – including non-fatal – conditions predispose to increased COVID-19 severity and 2) how incorporating the whole breadth of medical diagnosis can guide the interpretation of genetic risk loci.",,doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.05.23.23290408; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR667569; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR667569&type=FILE&fileName=EMS176610-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

The aim of this study was to examine clustering of COVID-19 symptoms based on underlying chronic disease and geographical location. Using a large global symptom survey of 78,299 responders in 190 different countries, we examined symptom profiles in relation to geolocation (grouped by country) and underlying chronic disease (single, co- or multi-morbidities) associated with a positive COVID-19 test result using statistical and machine learning methods to group populations by underlying disease, countries, and symptoms. Taking the responses of 7980 responders with a COVID-19 positive test in the top 5 contributing countries, we find that the most frequently reported symptoms differ across the globe: For example, fatigue 4108(51.5%), headache 3640(45.6%) and loss of smell and taste 3563(44.6%) are the most reported symptoms globally. However, symptom patterns differ by continent; India reported a significantly lower proportion of headache (22.8% vs 45.6%, p<0.05) and itchy eyes (7.0% vs. 15.3%, p<0.05) than other countries, as does Pakistan (33.6% vs 45.6%, p<0.05 and 8.6% vs 15.3%, p<0.05). Mexico and Brazil report significantly less of these symptoms. As with geographic location, we find people differed in their reported symptoms, if they suffered from specific underlying diseases. For example, COVID-19 positive responders with asthma or other lung disease were more likely to report shortness of breath as a symptom, compared with COVID-19 positive responders who had no underlying disease (25.3% vs. 13.7%, p<0.05, and 24.2 vs.13.7%, p<0.05). Responders with no underlying chronic diseases were more likely to report loss of smell and tastes as a symptom (46%), compared with the responders with type 1 diabetes (21.3%), Type 2 diabetes (33.5%) lung disease (29.3%), or hypertension (37.8%). Global symptom ranking differs markedly from the well-known and commonly described symptoms for COVID-19, which are based on a few localised studies. None of the five countries studied in depth recorded cough or temperature as the most common symptoms. The most common symptoms reported were fatigue and loss of smell and taste. Amongst responders from Brazil cough was the second most frequently reported symptom, after fatigue. Moreover, we find that across countries and based on underlying chronic diseases, there are significant differences in symptom profiles at presentation, that cannot be fully explained by the different chronic disease profiles of these countries, and may be caused by differences in climate, environment and ethnicities. These factors uncovered by our global comorbidity survey of COVID-19 positive tested people may contribute to the apparent large asymptotic COVID-19 spread and put patients with underlying disease systematically more at risk. <h4>Executive Summary</h4> <h4>Evidence before this work</h4> An early meta-analysis of epidemiological variation in COVID-19 inside and outside China studied patient characteristics including, gender, age, fatality rate, and symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath and diarrhoea in COVID-19 patients. They found that important symptom differences existed in patients in China compared to other countries and recommended that clinical symptoms of COVID-19 should not be generalized to fever, shortness of breath and cough only, but other symptoms such as diarrhoea are also shown to be prevalent in patients with COVID-19. <h4>Added value of this work</h4> W e find that across countries and based on underlying chronic diseases, there are significant differences in symptom profiles at presentation, that cannot be fully explained by the different chronic disease profiles of these countries, and may be caused by differences in climate, environment and ethnicities. <h4>Implications of the evidence</h4> These factors, uncovered by our global comorbidity survey of COVID-19 positive tested people may contribute to the apparent large asymptotic COVID-19 spread and put patients with underlying disease systematically more at risk.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/04/07/2021.04.02.21254818.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.02.21254818; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR308156; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR308156&type=FILE&fileName=EMS121846-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We investigated variation between local coronary and remote (peripheral) blood levels of a panel of atherosclerosis-associated proteins and examined how this might relate to cardiovascular risk assessment. <h4>Methods and Results</h4> In a previous proof-of-concept trial, coronary blood samples were collected using the LBS in 28 patients. For 12 of these patients, sampling was conducted across the uninstrumented lesion, prior to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Peripheral blood samples were also collected, at baseline and after PCI. Protein levels in coronary and peripheral plasma samples were analysed by proximity extension assay (PEA, Olink). Before PCI, in 10 out of 12 patients, coronary levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), pappalysin-1 (PAPPA) and spondin-1 (SPON1) were elevated compared with peripheral levels, in some cases >10-fold. Following PCI, involving iatrogenic plaque rupture prior to stenting, peripheral levels of these proteins were elevated to a similar degree as coronary levels. In 2 patients, peripheral elevations of HGF, PAPPA and SPON1 (all >90 th centile) were observed at baseline, prior to PCI. The protein pattern that was identified, consisting of high levels of a combination of HGF, PAPPA and SPON1 was absent in healthy control peripheral blood, but when investigated in baseline peripheral blood samples from reference cardiovascular and COVID-19 patient cohorts, was associated with the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and mortality. <h4>Conclusions</h4> From investigation of coronary and peripheral blood samples, we identified a novel inflammatory protein signature, which when present in peripheral blood appears to portend worse outcomes. Measurement of these proteins could therefore aid identification of individuals at high risk of cardiovascular events or death. <h4>Translational Perspective</h4> Through sampling of local coronary blood, we discovered a novel protein biosignature consisting of a combination of elevated levels of HGF, PAPPA and SPON1. When this biosignature was assessed in peripheral samples from reference cardiovascular and COVID-19 cohorts, it associated with the occurrence of MACE and mortality. The biosignature protein levels correlated with markers of mast cell and neutrophil activity but not with CRP, possibly indicating a specific inflammatory status. Early detection of this protein signal has potential clinical utility to identify specific patients at increased risk of poor outcomes. <h4>Graphical Abstract</h4>",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/04/12/2023.04.06.23288168.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.04.06.23288168; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR644063; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR644063&type=FILE&fileName=EMS174291-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

To this end, we translated complex clinical quality of care schemes from text descriptions into reusable analytic code. <h4>Methods</h4> With the approval of NHS England, a population based cohort study was conducted on 25.2 million patient records in situ using OpenSAFELY-TPP. We included all NHS patients registered at general practices using TPP software between March 2019 and March 2023. Individuals that were eligible for blood pressure screening and with a diagnosis of hypertension were identified according to the QOF 2021/22 business rules. We examined monthly changes in recorded blood pressure screening in the preceding 5 years in patients aged ≥ 45, recorded hypertension prevalence, and the recorded percentage of patients treated to target (i.e., ≤ 140/90 mmHg for patients ≤ 79 years and ≤ 150/90 mmHg for patients ≥ 80 years) in the preceding 12 months, within demographic, regional, and clinical subgroups as well as the variation across practices. <h4>Results</h4> The overall percentage of patients aged ≥ 45 who had blood pressure screening recorded in the preceding 5 years decreased from 90% in March 2019 to 85% in March 2023. Recorded hypertension prevalence was relatively stable at 15% throughout the study period. The percentage of patients with a record of hypertension treated to target in the preceding 12 months reduced from a maximum of 71% in March 2020 to a minimum of 47% in February 2021 in patients aged ≤ 79 years, and from 85% in March 2020 to a minimum of 58% in February 2021 in patients aged ≥ 80 years before recovering. Blood pressure screening rates in the preceding 5 years remained stable in older age groups, patients with a record of learning disability, or care home status. <h4>Conclusions</h4> There was substantial disruption to hypertension management QOF indicators during the pandemic, which can likely be attributed to a general reduction of blood pressure measurement including screening.

Multiple and interconnected challenges face the care home sector in the prevention and management of outbreaks of COVID-19, including adequate supply of personal protective equipment, staff shortages, and insufficient or lack of timely COVID-19 testing. Care homes are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases. <h4>Aim</h4> To analyse the mortality of older care home residents in Wales during COVID-19 lockdown and compare this across the population of Wales and the previous 4-years. <h4>Study Design and Setting</h4> We used anonymised Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and administrative data from the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank to create a cross-sectional cohort study. We anonymously linked data for Welsh residents to mortality data up to the 14 th June 2020. <h4>Methods</h4> We calculated survival curves and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of mortality. We adjusted hazard ratios for age, gender, social economic status and prior health conditions. <h4>Results</h4> Survival curves show an increased proportion of deaths between 23 rd March and 14 th June 2020 in care homes for older people, with an adjusted HR of 1·72 (1·55, 1·90) compared to 2016. Compared to the general population in 2016-2019, adjusted care home mortality HRs for older adults rose from 2·15 (2·11,2·20) in 2016-2019 to 2·94 (2·81,3·08) in 2020. <h4>Conclusions</h4> The survival curves and increased HRs show a significantly increased risk of death in the 2020 study periods.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/07/04/2020.07.03.20145839.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.03.20145839; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR183540; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR183540&type=FILE&fileName=EMS87632-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

The aim of this study was to identify a selection of national and/or multicentre clinical COVID-19 studies in the United Kingdom to examine the feasibility and outcomes of documenting the most frequent data elements common across studies to rapidly inform future study design and demonstrate proof-of-concept for further subject-specific study data element mapping to improve research data management. <h4>Methods:</h4> 25 COVID-19 studies were included. For each, information regarding the specific data elements being collected was recorded. Data elements collated were arbitrarily divided into categories for ease of visualisation. Elements which were most frequently and consistently recorded across studies are presented in relation to their relative commonality. <h4>Results:</h4> Across the 25 studies, 261 data elements were recorded in total. The most frequently recorded 100 data elements were identified across all studies and are presented with relative frequencies. Categories with the largest numbers of common elements included demographics, admission criteria, medical history and investigations. Mortality and need for specific respiratory support were the most common outcome measures, but with specific studies including a range of other outcome measures. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The findings of this study have demonstrated that it is feasible to collate specific data elements recorded across a range of studies investigating a specific clinical condition in order to identify those elements which are most common among studies. These data may be of value for those establishing new studies and to allow researchers to rapidly identify studies collecting data of potential use hence minimising duplication and increasing data re-use and interoperability",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/05/26/2020.05.19.20106641.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.19.20106641; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR167046; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.19.20106641

While lockdowns and physical distancing have proven effective for reducing COVID-19 transmission, there is still limited understanding of how NPI measures are reflected in indicators of human mobility. Further, there is a lack of understanding about how findings from high-income settings correspond to low and middle-income contexts. <h4>Methods</h4> In this study, we assess the relationship between indicators of human mobility, NPIs, and estimates of R t , a real-time measure of the intensity of COVID-19 transmission. We construct a multilevel generalised linear mixed model, combining local disease surveillance data from subnational districts of Ghana with the timing of NPIs and indicators of human mobility from Google and Vodafone Ghana. <h4>Findings</h4> We observe a relationship between reductions in human mobility and decreases in R t during the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in Ghana. We find that the strength of this relationship varies through time, decreasing after the most stringent period of interventions in the early epidemic. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Our findings demonstrate how the association of NPI and mobility indicators with COVID-19 transmission may vary through time. Further, we demonstrate the utility of combining local disease surveillance data with large scale human mobility data to augment existing surveillance capacity and monitor the impact of NPI policies. <h4>Research in Context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We searched PubMed and preprint archives for articles published in English that contained information about the COVID-19 pandemic published up to Nov 1, 2021, using the search terms “coronavirus”, “CoV”, “COVID-19”, “mobility”, “movement”, and “flow”. The data thus far suggests that NPI measures including physical distancing, reduction of travel, and use of personal protective equipment have been demonstrated to reduce COVID-19 transmission. Much of the existing research focuses on comparisons of NPI stringency with COVID-19 transmission among different high-income countries, or on high-income countries, leaving critical questions about the applicability of these findings to low- and middle-income settings. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> We used a detailed COVID-19 surveillance dataset from Ghana, and unique high resolution spatial data on human mobility from Vodafone Ghana as well as Google smartphone GPS location data. We show how human mobility and NPI stringency were associated with changes in the effective reproduction number (R t ). We further demonstrate how this association was strongest in the early COVID-19 outbreak in Ghana, decreasing after the relaxation of national restrictions. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> The change in association between human mobility, NPI stringency, and R t may reflect a “decoupling” of NPI stringency and human mobility from disease transmission in Ghana as the COVID-19 epidemic progressed. This finding provides public health decision makers with important insights for the understanding of the utility of mobility data for predicting the spread of COVID-19.",,doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.01.21265660; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR414478; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR414478&type=FILE&fileName=EMS137953-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We used linked national health records (demographic, death certificate, admissions and PCR testing data) to calculate rates of COVID-19 infection and death up to 31 July 2020. Our primary definition of COVID-19-related death was mention of COVID-19 on the death certificate. General population data from Public Health England and the Office for National Statistics were used for comparison. We also describe COVID-19-related hospital admissions and all-cause deaths. <h4>Results</h4> We identified a cohort of 168,680 people with RAIRD, of whom 1874 (1.11%) had a positive COVID-19 PCR test. The age-standardised infection rate was 1.54 (95% CI 1.50-1.59) times higher than in the general population. 713 (0.42%) people with RAIRD died with COVID-19 on their death certificate and the age-sex-standardised mortality rate for COVID-19-related death was 2.41 (2.30 – 2.53) times higher than in the general population. There was no evidence of an increase in deaths from other causes in the RAIRD population. <h4>Conclusions</h4> During the first wave of COVID-19 in England, people with RAIRD had a 54% increased risk of COVID-19 infection and more than twice the risk of COVID-19-related death compared to the general population.

Methods and analysis The national ethnicity-spine uses anonymised individual-level population-scale ethnicity data from 26 EHR available through the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. A total of 46 million ethnicity records for 4,297,694 individuals in Wales-UK over 22 years (between 2000 and 2021) have been compiled in a harmonised, deduplicated longitudinal research ready data asset. We serialised this data and compared distribution of records over time for four selection approaches (Latest, Mode, Weighted-Mode and Composite) across age bands, sex, deprivation quintiles, health board, and residential location, against the ONS census 2011. The distribution of the dominant group (White) is minimally affected based on the four different selection approaches. Across all other ethnicity categorisations, the Mixed group was most susceptible to variation in distribution depending on the selection approach used and varied from a 0.6% prevalence across the Latest and Mode approach to a 1.1% prevalence for the Weighted-Mode, compared to the 3.1% prevalence for the Composite approach. Substantial alignment was observed with ONS census with the Latest group method (kappa= 0.68, 95% CI [0.67,0.71]) across all sub-groups. Conclusion We provides a reproducible EHR based resource enabling the investigation and evaluation of health inequalities related to ethnic groups in Wales.

Unlike many other countries, the UK started easing lockdown in England when levels of community transmission were still high, and this could have a major impact on case numbers and deaths. However thus far, the likely impacts of easing restrictions at this point in the pandemic have not been quantified. Using a Bayesian model, we assessed the potential impacts of successive lockdown easing measures in England, focussing on scenarios where the reproductive number ( R ) remains ≤1 in line with the UK government’s stated aim. <h4>Methods</h4> We developed a Bayesian model to infer incident cases and R in England, from incident death data from the Office of National Statistics. We then used this to forecast excess cases and deaths in multiple plausible scenarios in which R increases at one or more time points, compared to a baseline scenario where R remains unchanged by the easing of lockdown. <h4>Findings</h4> The model inferred an R of 0.752 on the 13 th May when England first started easing lockdown. In the most conservative scenario where R increases to 0.80 as lockdown was eased further on 1 st June and then remained constant, the model predicts an excess 257 (95% 108-492) deaths and 26,447 (95% CI 11,105-50,549) cumulative cases over 90 days. In the scenario with maximal increases in R (but staying ≤1) with successive easing of lockdown, the model predicts 3,174 (95% 1,334-6,060) excess cumulative deaths and 421,310 (95% 177,012-804,811) excess cases. <h4>Results</h4> When levels of transmission are high, even small changes in R with easing of lockdown can have significant impacts on expected cases and deaths, even if R remains ≤1. This will have a major impact on population health, tracing systems and health care services in England.. Following an elimination strategy rather than one of maintenance of R below 1 would substantially mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic within England.

Our approach relies on automatically selecting the best (fitting or predicting) model from a range of user-defined time series models, excluding the most recent data points, to characterise the main trend in an incidence. We then derive prediction intervals and classify data points outside this interval as outliers, which provides an objective criterion for identifying departures from previous trends. We also provide a method for selecting the optimal breakpoints, used to define how many recent data points are to be excluded from the trend fitting procedure. The analysis of simulated COVID-19 outbreaks suggest ASMODEE compares favourably with a state-of-art outbreak-detection algorithm while being simpler and more flexible.

Using protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) data from the SCALLOP consortium, involving meta-analysis of up to 26,494 individuals, and COVID-19 genome-wide association data from the Host Genetics Initiative, we performed MR for 157 COVID-19 severity protein biomarkers. We identified significant MR results for five proteins: FAS, TNFRSF10A, CCL2, EPHB4 and LGALS9. Further evaluation of these candidates using sensitivity analyses and colocalization testing provided strong evidence to implicate the apoptosis-associated cytokine receptor FAS as a causal mediator of severe COVID-19.

Using RNA-seq data from 4,778 individuals, we demonstrate that the pQTL at the FAS locus results from genetically influenced alternate splicing causing skipping of exon 6. We show that the risk allele for very severe COVID-19 increases the proportion of transcripts lacking exon 6, and thereby increases soluble FAS. Soluble FAS acts as a decoy receptor for FAS-ligand, inhibiting apoptosis induced through membrane-bound FAS. In summary, we demonstrate a novel genetic mechanism that contributes to risk of severe of COVID-19, highlighting a pathway that may be a promising therapeutic target.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/04/07/2021.04.01.21254789.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.01.21254789; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR308166; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR308166&type=FILE&fileName=EMS121852-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

To investigate the gene-regulatory cascades that ensue from these variants, we mapped blood gene expression and splicing quantitative trait loci (QTLs) through bulk RNA-sequencing in 4,732 participants, and integrated these data with protein, metabolite and lipid QTLs in the same individuals. We identified cis -QTLs for the expression of 17,233 genes and 29,514 splicing events (in 6,853 genes). Using colocalization analysis, we identified 3,430 proteomic and metabolomic traits with a shared association signal with either gene expression or splicing. We quantified the relative contribution of the genetic effects at loci with shared etiology through statistical mediation, observing 222 molecular phenotypes significantly mediated by gene expression or splicing. We uncovered gene-regulatory mechanisms at GWAS disease loci with therapeutic implications, such as WARS1 in hypertension, IL7R in dermatitis and IFNAR2 in COVID-19.

The extensive number of potential drug combinations and context-specific response profiles complicates the prediction of drug combination responses. Existing computational models are typically trained to predict a single aggregated synergy score, which summarises drug responses across different dosage combinations, such as Bliss or Loewe scores. This oversimplification of the drug-response surface leads to high prediction uncertainty and limited actionability because these models fail to differentiate between potency and efficacy. <h4>Results</h4> We introduce DeepSynBa, an actionable model that predicts the complete dose-response matrix of drug pairs instead of relying on an aggregated synergy score. This is achieved by predicting parameters describing the response surface as an intermediate layer in the model. We evaluated DeepSynBa on the NCI-ALMANAC dataset, which comprises nearly 300,000 drug pair–cell line combinations. DeepSynBa outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the dose-response matrix prediction task across multiple evaluation scenarios, including testing on novel drug combinations, cell lines, and drugs, across nine different tissue types. We also show that DeepSynBa yields reliable synergy score predictions. More importantly, DeepSynBa can predict drug combination responses across different dosages for untested combinations. The intermediate dose-response parameter layer allows for separating efficacy from potency, which informs the selection of dosage ranges that optimise efficacy while limiting off-target toxicity in experimental screens. The predictive capability and the downstream actionability make DeepSynBa a powerful tool for advancing drug combination research beyond the limitations of the current approaches. <h4>Availability</h4> The code and the dataset for DeepSynBa are available at https://github.com/hikuru/DeepSynBa . <h4>Contact</h4> marta.milo@astrazeneca.com or otastan@sabanciuniv.edu",,doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.28.634673; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.28.634673; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR971350; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR971350&type=FILE&fileName=EMS202968-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Genetic variants in IL6R known to downregulate IL-6 signalling are associated with improved COVID-19 outcomes, a finding later confirmed in randomised trials of IL-6 receptor antagonists (IL6RA). We hypothesised that blockade of IL6R could also improve outcomes in sepsis. <h4>Methods</h4> We performed a Mendelian randomisation analysis using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in and near IL6R to evaluate the likely causal effects of IL6R blockade on sepsis, sepsis severity, other infections, and COVID-19. We weighted SNPs by their effect on CRP and combined results across them in inverse variance weighted meta-analysis, proxying the effect of IL6RA. Our outcomes were measured in UK Biobank, FinnGen, the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (HGI), and the GenOSept and GainS consortium. We performed several sensitivity analyses to test assumptions of our methods, including utilising variants around CRP in a similar analysis. <h4>Results</h4> In the UK Biobank cohort (N=485,825, including 11,643 with sepsis), IL6R blockade was associated with a decreased risk of sepsis (OR=0.80; 95% CI 0.66-0.96, per unit of natural log transformed CRP decrease). The size of this effect increased with severity, with larger effects on 28-day sepsis mortality (OR=0.74; 95% CI 0.38-0.70); critical care admission with sepsis (OR=0.48, 95% CI 0.30-0.78) and critical care death with sepsis (OR=0.37, 95% CI 0.14 - 0.98) Similar associations were seen with severe respiratory infection: OR for pneumonia in critical care 0.69 (95% CI 0.49 - 0.97) and for sepsis survival in critical care (OR=0.22; 95% CI 0.04- 1.31) in the GainS and GenOSept consortium. We also confirm the previously reported protective effect of IL6R blockade on severe COVID-19 (OR=0.69, 95% 0.57 - 0.84) in the COVID-19 HGI, which was of similar magnitude to that seen in sepsis. Sensitivity analyses did not alter our primary results. <h4>Conclusions</h4> IL6R blockade is causally associated with reduced incidence of sepsis, sepsis related critical care admission, and sepsis related mortality. These effects are comparable in size to the effect seen in severe COVID-19, where IL-6 receptor antagonists were shown to improve survival. This data suggests a randomised trial of IL-6 receptor antagonists in sepsis should be considered.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/07/15/2022.07.14.22277638.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.07.14.22277638; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR518927; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR518927&type=FILE&fileName=EMS150974-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We analysed healthcare services delivered to people with pancreatic cancer from January 2015 to March 2023 to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. <h4>Methods</h4>  With the approval of NHS England, and drawing from a nationally representative OpenSAFELY-TPP dataset of 24 million patients (over 40% of the English population), we undertook a cohort study of people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. We queried electronic healthcare records for information on the provision of healthcare services across the pancreatic cancer pathway. To estimate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, we predicted the rates of healthcare services if the pandemic had not happened. We used generalised linear models (GLM) and the pre-pandemic data from January 2015 to February 2020 to predict rates in March 2020 to March 2023. The 95% confidence intervals of the predicted values were used to estimate the significance of the difference between the predicted and observed rates. <h4>Results</h4>  The rate of pancreatic cancer and diabetes diagnoses in the cohort was not affected by the pandemic. There were 26,840 people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer from January 2015 to March 2023. The mean age at diagnosis was 72 (±11 SD), 48% of people were female, 95% were of White ethnicity and 40% were diagnosed with diabetes. We found a reduction in surgical resections by 25% to 28% during the pandemic. In addition, 20%, 10% and 4% fewer people received BMI, HbA1c and liver function tests respectively before they were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. There was no impact of the pandemic on the number of people making contact with primary care, but the number of contacts increased on average by 1 to 2 per person amongst those who made contact. Reporting of jaundice decreased by 28%, but recovered within twelve months into the pandemic. Emergency department visits, hospital admissions and deaths were not affected. <h4>Conclusions</h4>  The pandemic affected healthcare in England across the pancreatic cancer pathway. Positive lessons could be learnt from the services that were resilient and those that recovered quickly. The reductions in healthcare experienced by people with cancer have the potential to lead to worse outcomes. Current efforts should focus on addressing the unmet needs of people with cancer. <h4>Funding</h4>  This work was jointly funded by the Wellcome Trust (222097/Z/20/Z); MRC (MR/V015757/1, MC_PC-20059, MR/W016729/1); NIHR (NIHR135559, COV-LT2-0073), and Health Data Research UK (HDRUK2021.000, 2021.0157).

These novel models showed good discrimination and calibration in both derivation and external validation cohorts, and outperformed the existing ISARIC model and 4C score in the derivation dataset. We found that addition of comorbidities to the set of candidate predictors included in model derivation did not improve model performance. If integrated into hospital electronic medical records systems, the model algorithms will provide a predicted probability of mortality or ITU admission for each patient based on their individual data at, or close to, the time of admission, which will support clinicians’ decision making with regard to appropriate patient care pathways and triage. This information might also assist clinicians in explaining complex prognostic assessments and decisions to patients and their relatives. A limitation of the study was that in the external validation cohort we were unable to examine all of the predictors included in the original full UHB model due to only a reduced set of candidate predictors being available in CovidCollab. Nevertheless, the reduced model performed well and the results suggest it may be applicable in a wide range of datasets where only a reduced set of predictor variables is available. Furthermore, it was not possible to carry out stratified analysis by ethnicity as the UHB dataset contained too few patients in most of the strata, and no ethnicity data was available in the CovidCollab dataset.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/01/30/2021.01.25.21249942.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.25.21249942; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR276290; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR276290&type=FILE&fileName=EMS115610-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Our objectives were to compare symptoms in patients with and without a history of COVID-19, and investigate symptoms associated with a Long Covid diagnosis. <h4>METHODS</h4> We used primary care electronic health record data from The Health Improvement Network (THIN), a Cegedim database. We included adults registered with participating practices in England, Scotland or Wales. We extracted information about 89 symptoms and ‘Long Covid’ diagnoses from free text using natural language processing. We calculated hazard ratios (adjusted for age, sex, baseline medical conditions and prior symptoms) for each symptom from 12 weeks after the COVID-19 diagnosis. <h4>FINDINGS</h4> We compared 11,015 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and 18,098 unexposed controls. Only 20% of symptom records were coded, with 80% in free text. A wide range of symptoms were associated with COVID-19 at least 12 weeks post-infection, with strongest associations for fatigue (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 3.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.59, 4.44), shortness of breath (aHR 3.14, 95% CI 2.88, 3.42), palpitations (aHR 2.75, 95% CI 2.28, 3.32), and phlegm (aHR 2.88, 95% CI 2.30, 3.61). However, a limited subset of symptoms were recorded within 7 days prior to a Long Covid diagnosis in more than 20% of cases: shortness of breath, chest pain, pain, fatigue, cough, and anxiety / depression. <h4>CONCLUSION</h4> Numerous symptoms are reported to primary care at least 12 weeks after COVID-19 infection, but only a subset are commonly associated with a GP diagnosis of Long Covid.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/01/09/2023.01.06.23284202.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.01.06.23284202; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR594314; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR594314&type=FILE&fileName=EMS159579-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We measured weekly proportion of self-harm contacts and people who self-harmed in contact with general practice (GP), emergency department (ED) and hospital admissions. We modelled weekly trends using linear regression and generalised estimated equations, quantifying time differences using difference-in-difference (DiD). <h4>Results</h4> We included 3,552,210 Welsh residents aged ≥10 years. Counts of self-harm presentations across settings was at a minimum at the start of stay-at-home restrictions during both waves and recovered compared to previous years in 3-5 months. Those who self-harmed in April 2020 were more likely to be seen in GP compared to other settings and previous years – mean rate of OR=1.2, although actual numbers fell. The proportion of self-harm ED contacts admitted to hospital dropped from June 2020 (1.9 [1.5-2.3] pp/month). Self-harm and COVID-19 infection had a bidirectional effect – self-harm history had OR=1.4 [1.2-1.6] and incidence had DiD=1.1 [0.8-1.4]. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Those that self-harmed and sought help during the COVID-19 pandemic potentially encountered stringent criteria for hospitalisation, particularly in Wave 2, while in Wave 1 they preferentially presented to GP. Reductions in contacts likely resulted in unmet healthcare needs which may later emerge placing further burden on individuals and healthcare services. <h4>Relevance statement</h4> This study provides novel findings on how the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to curb its spread affected self-harm healthcare service presentations. To our knowledge no other population-based studies in the UK have linked routinely collected general practice (GP), emergency department (ED) and hospital admission data covering Waves 1 and 2 of the pandemic. Reductions in presentations with self-harm during the pandemic may be the result of those not requiring ED care or hospitalisation avoiding seeking help during the pandemic as often as before. Those that did seek help potentially encountered more stringent criteria for hospitalisation, particularly during Wave 2. This likely resulted in unmet healthcare needs which may later emerge placing further burden on individuals and healthcare services.

They are known to influence health conditions: most notably being associated with protection from human African trypanosomiasis and increased risk of susceptibility to chronic kidney disease. Association studies have often considered G1 and G2 as equivalent, however we recently presented evidence of substantial phenotypic differences between carriers of the two variants. An additional APOL1 variant, N264K, has previously been shown to modify the damaging effect of G2 on the kidney. Here, we examine the influence of these variants on APOL1 protein concentration. <h4>Methods</h4> Using a cohort of 1,050 UK Biobank participants with recent African ancestry, we compared APOL1 protein concentration in carriers of variants G1, G2, and N264K and performed a genome-wide association study to identify additional modifiers of APOL1 concentration. We also compared APOL1 concentration across self-reported ethnicities for all 43,330 UK Biobank participants for whom APOL1 concentration data was available. <h4>Findings</h4> APOL1 G1 and G2 are both associated with increased APOL1 protein concentration, however the effect of G2 is more marked, and it was the only locus that reached genome-wide significance in terms of association with APOL1 concentration (p = 3×10 −155 ). In a G2 background, the presence of N264K is associated with a reduction in APOL1 concentration (p = 6 × 10 −5 ). People with self-reported Black or Black British ethnicity have higher APOL1 concentrations all other self-reported ethnicities in the UK Biobank. <h4>Interpretation</h4> These findings demonstrate the influence of APOL1 variants and APOL1 protein concentration and identify additional phenotypic differences between the G1 and G2, highlighting the value in considering them as distinct in molecular and association studies. This work also provides further detail on the relationship between the G2 and N264K variants, which has significant implications for diagnosis and therapy in kidney disease.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2024/02/29/2024.02.28.24303461.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.28.24303461; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR812457; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR812457&type=FILE&fileName=EMS194386-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

However, whom it is reaching and how effectively it is being implemented remains unclear. This study aimed to assess longitudinal trends in SP in England’s primary care system, including growth trajectories and target alignment, sociodemographic profiles of referred patients, and predictors of service refusal over time. <h4>Methods</h4>  This study analysed primary care records from 1.2 million patients from 1,736 practices in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink in England. We estimated SP trends between 2019 and 2023 using growth curve modelling on SP numbers at practice level. Descriptive analyses were used to show changes in sociodemographic profiles of SP patients over time. To assess sociodemographic disparities in service refusal (defined as having a medical code of ‘social prescribing declined’), we used multilevel logistic regression models stratified by year, accounting for nested data structure where patients were nested within practices. <h4>Findings</h4>  As of the end of 2023, an estimated 9.4m GP consultations in England have involved SP codes, and 5.5m consultations have specifically led to SP referrals. In 2023, females constituted 60% of SP patients and ethnic minority groups represented 23%. Representation from patients living in more deprived areas increased from 23% to 42% between 2017-2023. Service refusal declined from 22% to 12% between 2019-2023. Age, sex and ethnicity were associated with service refusal across multiple years. In 2023, notably, all age groups had higher odds of refusal compared to the youngest age group. Females had 21% lower odds of refusal than males (95% CI=0.77-0.82), and patients from white ethnic backgrounds had 32% higher odds of refusal than ethnic minority patients (95% CI=1.26-1.39). <h4>Interpretation</h4>  SP has expanded rapidly in England, far exceeding initial targets of 900,000 patients by 2023/24 and suggesting broad service acceptability. Progress is being made in reaching certain target groups such as more deprived communities. However, there are still disparities in accessibility and uptake, calling for targeted strategies to address underlying inequalities. <h4>Funding</h4>  MQ Transforming Mental Health, Rosetrees-Stoneygate Trust Fellowship, National Academy for Social Prescribing <h4>Research in context</h4>  <h4>Evidence before this study</h4>  We systematically searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and OpenGrey for studies (including grey literature) published in English between January 1980 and March 2025, using search terms such as ‘social prescribing’, ‘non-medical referral/intervention’, ‘non-clinical referral/intervention’, ‘community referral’, ‘referral scheme’. Prior evidence on rates and patterns of referrals was limited to small-scale evaluations, cross-sectional data, or regional analyses, with a lack of nationally representative longitudinal studies examining implementation trends or equity. Systematic reviews highlighted gaps in understanding disparities in service access and uptake. While the National Health Service (NHS) Long Term Plan (2019) set ambitious targets for SP, no studies had quantified progress toward these goals since the national rollout. <h4>Added value of this study</h4>  Using primary care medical records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), this study provides the first longitudinal, national analysis of SP implementation across 1.2 million patients in England. We demonstrate that SP referrals exceeded NHS targets by 27–51% in 2023, with at least 1.1–1.4 million patients receiving referrals. The analysis reveals significant progress in reaching deprived populations (representation increased from 23% to 42% between 2017-2023) but identifies persistent disparities in service uptake across age, sex, and deprivation groups. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4>  The rapid expansion of SP reflects its growing integration into primary care. However, persistent sociodemographic disparities highlight the need for targeted interventions to ensure equitable service access and uptake. This study provides policymakers with evidence to standardise referral protocols and allocate resources to underserved areas. Future research should rigorously track the implementation of SP, evaluate its long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness to fulfil its potentials as a key component of universal personalised care.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2025/04/05/2025.04.04.25325237.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.04.04.25325237; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR998875; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR998875&type=FILE&fileName=EMS204412-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

LoS can vary depending on the patient’s “bed pathway” - the sequence of transfers between bed types during a hospital stay. In this study, we characterise these pathways, and their impact on predicted hospital bed occupancy. <h4>Design</h4> We obtained data from University College Hospital (UCH) and the ISARIC4C COVID-19 Clinical Information Network (CO-CIN) on hospitalised patients with COVID-19 who required care in general ward or critical care (CC) beds to determine possible bed pathways and LoS. We developed a discrete-time model to examine the implications of using either bed pathways or only average LoS by bed type to forecast bed occupancy. We compared model-predicted bed occupancy to publicly available bed occupancy data on COVID-19 in England between March and August 2020. <h4>Results</h4> In both the UCH and CO-CIN datasets, 82% of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 only received care in general ward beds. We identified four other bed pathways, present in both datasets: “Ward, CC, Ward”, “Ward, CC”, “CC” and “CC, Ward”. Mean LoS varied by bed type, pathway, and dataset, between 1.78 and 13.53 days. For UCH, we found that using bed pathways improved the accuracy of bed occupancy predictions, while only using an average LoS for each bed type underestimated true bed occupancy. However, using the CO-CIN LoS dataset we were not able to replicate past data on bed occupancy in England, suggesting regional LoS heterogeneities. <h4>Conclusions</h4> We identified five bed pathways, with substantial variation in LoS by bed type, pathway, and geography. This might be caused by local differences in patient characteristics, clinical care strategies, or resource availability, and suggests that national LoS averages may not be appropriate for local forecasts of bed occupancy for COVID-19.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/01/15/2021.01.14.21249791.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.14.21249791; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR265315; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR265315&type=FILE&fileName=EMS110614-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Genetic variation may be associated with varenicline response, but to date no genome-wide association studies of varenicline response have been published. <h4>Methods</h4> In this study, we investigated the genetic contribution to varenicline effectiveness using two electronic health record-derived phenotypes. We defined short-term varenicline effectiveness (SVE) and long-term varenicline effectiveness (LVE) by assessing smoking status at 3 and 12 months, respectively, after initiating varenicline treatment. In Stage 1, comprising five European cohort studies, we tested genome-wide associations with SVE (1,405 cases, 2,074 controls) and LVE (1,576 cases, 2,555 controls), defining sentinel variants (the most strongly associated variant within 1 megabase) with p -value <5×10 −6 to follow up in Stage 2. In Stage 2, we tested association between sentinel variants and comparable smoking cessation endpoints in varenicline randomised controlled trials. We subsequently meta-analysed Stages 1 and 2. <h4>Results</h4> No variants reached genome-wide significance in the meta-analysis. In Stage 1, 10 sentinel variants were associated with SVE and five with LVE at a suggestive significance threshold ( p -value <5×10 −6 ). None of these sentinels were previously implicated in varenicline-aided smoking cessation or in genetic studies of smoking behaviour. <h4>Conclusions</h4> We provide initial insights into the biological underpinnings of varenicline-aided smoking cessation, through implicating genes involved in various processes, including gene expression, cilium assembly and early-stage development. <h4>Implications</h4> Leveraging electronic health records, we undertook the largest genetic study of varenicline-aided smoking cessation to date, and the only such study to test genome-wide associations. We showed distinct genetic variants associated ( p -value <5×10 −6 ) with varenicline-aided smoking cessation which implicate diverse cellular functions, including transcriptional regulation, RNA modification and cilium assembly. These provide insights which, if independently corroborated, will improve understanding of varenicline response.

We describe the proportion of patients recorded as declining a COVID-19 vaccination for each priority group, and by other clinical and demographic factors; whether patients recorded as “declined” subsequently went on to receive a vaccination; and the distribution of code usage across GP practices. <h4>Results</h4> Of 24.5 million patients in priority groups as of May 25th 2021, 89.2% had received a vaccine, 8.8% had neither a vaccination nor a decline recorded, and 663,033 (2.7%) had a decline code recorded. Of patients with a recorded decline, 125,587 (18.9%) were subsequently vaccinated. Subsequent vaccination was slightly more common in the South Asian population than other ethnicities (e.g. 32.3% vs 22.8%, over 65s). The proportion of declining-unvaccinated patients varied strongly with ethnicity (Black 15.3%, South Asian 5.6%, White 1.5% in over 80s); and was higher in patients from more deprived areas. COVID-19 vaccine decline codes were present in almost all practices (98.8%), but with wide variation between practices in rates of usage. Among all priority groups, declining-unvaccinated status was most common in CEV (3.3%). <h4>Conclusions</h4> Clinical codes indicative of COVID-19 vaccinations being declined are widely used in English general practice. They are substantially more common among Black and South Asian patients, and patients from more deprived areas. There is a need for more detailed survey and/or qualitative research with patients and clinicians to determine the most common reasons for these recorded declines.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/08/07/2021.08.05.21259863.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.05.21259863; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR379947; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR379947&type=FILE&fileName=EMS132430-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

The NHS stopped non-urgent work in March 2020, later recommending services be restored to near-normal levels before winter where possible. <h4>Aims</h4> Using routinely collected data, our aim was to describe changes in the volume and variation of coded clinical activity in general practice in: (i) cardiovascular disease, (ii) diabetes, (iii) mental health, (iv) female and reproductive health, (v) screening, and (vi) processes related to medication. <h4>Design and setting</h4> With the approval of NHS England, we conducted a cohort study of 23.8 million patient records in general practice, in-situ using OpenSAFELY. <h4>Methods</h4> We selected common primary care activity using CTV3 codes and keyword searches from January 2019 - December 2020, presenting median and deciles of code usage across practices per month. <h4>Results</h4> We identified substantial and widespread changes in clinical activity in primary care since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with generally good recovery by December 2020. A few exceptions showed poor recovery and warrant further investigation, such as mental health, e.g. “Depression interim review” (median across practices in December 2020 -41.6% compared to December 2019). <h4>Conclusions</h4> Granular NHS GP data at population-scale can be used to monitor disruptions to healthcare services and guide the development of mitigation strategies. The authors are now developing real-time monitoring dashboards for key measures identified here as well as further studies, using primary care data to monitor and mitigate the indirect health impacts of Covid-19 on the NHS. <h4>How this fits in</h4> During the COVID-19 pandemic, routine healthcare services in England faced significant disruption, and NHS England recommended restoring NHS services to near-normal levels before winter 2020. Our previous report covered the disruption and recovery in pathology tests and respiratory activity: here we describe an additional six areas of common primary care activity. We found most activities exhibited significant reductions during pandemic wave 1 (with most recovering to near-normal levels by December); however many important aspects of care - especially those of a more time-critical nature - were maintained throughout the pandemic. We recommend key measures for ongoing monitoring and further investigation of the impacts on health inequalities, to help measure and mitigate the ongoing indirect health impacts of COVID-19 on the NHS.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/06/02/2022.06.01.22275674.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.01.22275674; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR501803; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR501803&type=FILE&fileName=EMS145734-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Most approaches to risk prediction of COVID-19 focus on binary or tertiary severity outcomes, despite the heterogeneity of the disease.

We propose two innovative clustering approaches − ‘Layered Axes’ and ‘Prognosis Space’ – to apply on patients’ outcome data. We then show how these clusters can help predict a patient’s deterioration pathway on their hospital admission, using random forest classification. We illustrate this methodology on a cohort from Wuhan in early 2020. We discover interesting subgroups of poor prognosis, particularly within respiratory patients, and predict respiratory subgroup membership with high accuracy.

Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom (to date at least) have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high risk conditions or their longer term background (pre-COVID-19) mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence rates and differing mortality impacts. <h4>Methods</h4> Using population based linked primary and secondary care electronic health records in England (HDR UK - CALIBER), we report the prevalence of underlying conditions defined by UK Public Health England COVID-19 guidelines (16 March 2020) in 3,862,012 individuals aged ≥30 years from 1997-2017. We used previously validated phenotypes, openly available ( https://caliberresearch.org/portal ), for each condition using ICD-10 diagnosis, Read, procedure and medication codes. We estimated the 1-year mortality in each condition, and developed simple models of excess COVID-19-related deaths assuming relative risk (RR) of the impact of the emergency (compared to background mortality) of 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0. <h4>Findings</h4> 20.0% of the population are at risk according to current PHE guidelines, of which; 13.7% were age>70 years and 6.3% aged ≤70 years with ≥1 underlying condition (cardiovascular disease (2.3%), diabetes (2.2%), steroid therapy (1.9%), severe obesity (0.9%), chronic kidney disease (0.6%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD (0.5%). Multimorbidity (co-occurrence of ≥2 conditions in an individual) was common (10.1%). The 1-year mortality in the at-risk population was 4.46%, and age and underlying conditions combine to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions (5.9% in age>70 years, 8.6% for COPD and 13.1% in those with ≥3 or more conditions). In a suppression scenario (at SARS CoV2 rates of 0.001% of the UK population), there would be minimal excess deaths (3 and 7 excess deaths at relative risk, RR, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). At SARS CoV2 rates of 10% of the UK population (mitigation) the model estimates the numbers of excess deaths as: 13791, 34479 and 68957 (at RR 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). At SARS CoV2 rates of 80% in the UK population (“do-nothing”), the model estimates the number of excess deaths as 110332, 275,830 and 551,659 (at RR 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0) respectively. <h4>Interpretation</h4> We provide the public, researchers and policy makers a simple model to estimate the excess mortality over 1 year from COVID-19, based on underlying conditions at different ages. If the relative mortality impact of COVID-19 were to be about 20% (similar magnitude as the established winter vs summer mortality excess), then the excess deaths would be 0 when 1 in 100 000 (suppression), 13791 when 1 in 10 (mitigation) and 110332 when 8 in 10 are infected (“do nothing”) scenario. However, the relative impact of COVID-19 is unknown. If the emergency were to double the mortality risk, then we estimate 7, 68957 and 551,659 excess deaths in the same scenarios. These results may inform the need for more stringent suppression measures as well as efforts to target those at highest risk for a range of preventive interventions.","This study aimed to provide initial estimates of the excess covid-19 related deaths over a 1 year period, based on different rates of infection. This also accounted for underlying conditions at different ages.The results obtained from this study might inform the need for more stringent suppressionmeasures and increased effots to target thise at higher risk.",pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/03/24/2020.03.22.20040287.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040287; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR118686; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR118686&type=FILE&fileName=EMS89384-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We quantify potential drivers of this change and identify groups of patients who remain at high risk of dying in hospital. <h4>Methods</h4> The International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK recruited a prospective cohort admitted to 247 acute UK hospitals with COVID-19 in the first wave (March to August 2020). Outcome was hospital mortality within 28 days of admission. We performed a three-way decomposition mediation analysis using natural effects models to explore associations between week of admission and hospital mortality adjusting for confounders (demographics, comorbidity, illness severity) and quantifying potential mediators (respiratory support and steroids). <h4>Findings</h4> Unadjusted hospital mortality fell from 32.3% (95%CI 31.8, 32.7) in March/April to 16.4% (95%CI 15.0, 17.8) in June/July 2020. Reductions were seen in all ages, ethnicities, both sexes, and in comorbid and non-comorbid patients. After adjustment, there was a 19% reduction in the odds of mortality per 4 week period (OR 0.81, 95%CI 0.79, 0.83). 15.2% of this reduction was explained by greater disease severity and comorbidity earlier in the epidemic. The use of respiratory support changed with greater use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV). 22.2% (OR 0.94, 95%CI 0.94, 0.96) of the reduction in mortality was mediated by changes in respiratory support. <h4>Interpretation</h4> The fall in hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients during the first wave in the UK was partly accounted for by changes in case mix and illness severity. A significant reduction was associated with differences in respiratory support and critical care use, which may partly reflect improved clinical decision making. The remaining improvement in mortality is not explained by these factors, and may relate to community behaviour on inoculum dose and hospital capacity strain. <h4>Funding</h4> NIHR & MRC <h4>Key points / Research in Context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> Risk factors for mortality in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 have been established. However there is little literature regarding how mortality is changing over time, and potential explanations for why this might be. Understanding changes in mortality rates over time will help policy makers identify evolving risk, strategies to manage this and broader decisions about public health interventions. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> Mortality in hospitalised patients at the beginning of the first wave was extremely high. Patients who were admitted to hospital in March and early April were significantly more unwell at presentation than patients who were admitted in later months. Mortality fell in all ages, ethnic groups, both sexes and in patients with and without comorbidity, over and above contributions from falling illness severity. After adjustment for these variables, a fifth of the fall in mortality was explained by changes in the use of respiratory support and steroid treatment, along with associated changes in clinical decision-making relating to supportive interventions. However, mortality was persistently high in patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation, and in those patients who received non-invasive ventilation outside of critical care. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> The observed reduction in hospital mortality was greater than expected based on the changes seen in both case mix and illness severity. Some of this fall can be explained by changes in respiratory care, including clinical learning. In addition, introduction of community policies including wearing of masks, social distancing, shielding of vulnerable patients and the UK lockdown potentially resulted in people being exposed to less virus. The decrease in mortality varied depending on the level of respiratory support received. Patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation have persistently high mortality rates, albeit with a changing case-mix, and further research should target this group. Severe COVID-19 disease has primarily affected older people in the UK. Many of these people, but not all have significant frailty. It is essential to ensure that patients and their families remain at the centre of decision-making, and we continue with an individualised approach to their treatment and care.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/12/22/2020.12.19.20248559.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.19.20248559; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR257169; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR257169&type=FILE&fileName=EMS109127-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Despite chronic cough representing a substantial health burden, its biological mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesised shared genetic architecture between chronic dry cough and ACEi-induced cough and aimed to identify causal genes underlying both phenotypes. <h4>Methods</h4> We performed multi-ancestry genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of chronic dry cough and ACEi-induced cough, and a multi-trait GWAS of both phenotypes, utilising data from five cohort studies. Chronic dry cough was defined by questionnaire responses, and ACEi-induced cough by treatment switches or clinical diagnosis in electronic health records. We mapped putative causal genes and performed phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) of associated variants and genetic risk scores (GRS) for these phenotypes to identify pleotropic effects. <h4>Findings</h4> We found seven novel genetic association signals reaching p -value <5×10 −8 in the multi-trait or single-trait analyses of chronic dry cough and ACEi-induced cough. The novel variants mapped to 10 novel genes, and we mapped an additional three novel genes to known risk variants, many of which implicating neurological functions ( CTNNA1, KCNA10, MAPKAP1, OR4C12, OR4C13, SIL1 ). The GRS-PheWAS highlighted associations with increased risk of several conditions reported as comorbidities of chronic cough, including fibromyalgia pain, and with spirometry measurements. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Our findings advance the understanding of neuronal dysfunction underlying cough hypersensitivity in chronic dry cough and ACEi-induced cough at the population-level, and the identification of comorbidities associated with genetic predisposition to cough could inform drug target discovery. <h4>Funding</h4> Medical Research Council, Wellcome Trust, National Institute for Health and Care Research, Orion Pharma. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We searched the National Human Genome Research Institute-European Bioinformatic Institute Catalog of human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from inception through to 21 st May 2024, using the search term “cough” to identify publications which tested association between genetic variants and cough. Additionally, we searched PubMed for English language articles published before 21 st May 2024 using the terms “cough” or “ACE inhibitor” combined with “genome-wide association” to find relevant publications. We manually filtered the results from both searches to ensure the cough-related publications related to a dry, unproductive cough. To date, there have been no GWAS of unexplained dry cough, while several for ACE inhibitor (ACEi)-induced cough have identified 11 associated genetic loci at genome-wide significance ( p -value <5×10 −8 ). These loci have implicated genes involved in neuronal excitability and the bradykinin pathway. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> We present the first multi-ancestry GWAS of chronic dry cough, defined using questionnaire responses, and the largest multi-ancestry GWAS of ACEi-induced cough, characterised by either a medication switch from an ACEi to an angiotensin-II receptor blocker or a clinical diagnosis. By leveraging the clinical and genetic overlap between these two traits, we conducted a multi-trait GWAS to identify novel associated loci. Across the multi-trait and single-trait analyses, we identified seven novel associated loci at genome-wide significance ( p -value <5×10 −8 ), mapped to 10 genes which have not previously been linked to cough phenotypes. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> We identified novel genes involved in neurological processes ( CTNNA1, KCNA10, OR4C12, OR4C13 ) or implicated in neurological or neurodegenerative conditions ( SIL1 and MAPKAP1 ). The genes we implicate from all genetic associations with cough to date support the role of neurobiological processes underlying dry cough biology, and highlight potential therapeutic targets.",,doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.23.24310853; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.23.24310853; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR886242; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR886242&type=FILE&fileName=EMS197791-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Risk-scores proposed for rapid triage of need for admission from the emergency department (ED) have been developed in higher-income settings during initial waves of the pandemic. <h4>Methods</h4> Routinely collected data for public hospitals in the Western Cape, South Africa from the 27 th August 2020 to 11 th March 2022 were used to derive a cohort of 446,084 ED patients with suspected COVID-19. The primary outcome was death or ICU admission at 30 days. The cohort was divided into derivation and Omicron variant validation sets. We developed the LMIC-PRIEST score based on the coefficients from multivariable analysis in the derivation cohort and existing triage practices. We externally validated accuracy in the Omicron period and a UK cohort. <h4>Results</h4> We analysed 305,564, derivation 140,520 Omicron and 12,610 UK validation cases. Over 100 events per predictor parameter were modelled. Multivariable analyses identified eight predictor variables retained across models. We used these findings and clinical judgement to develop a score based on South African Triage Early Warning Scores and also included age, sex, oxygen saturation, inspired oxygen, diabetes and heart disease. The LMIC-PRIEST score achieved C-statistics: 0.82 (95% CI: 0.82 to 0.83) development cohort; 0.79 (95% CI: 0.78 to 0.80) Omicron cohort; and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.79 to 0.80) UK cohort. Differences in prevalence of outcomes led to imperfect calibration in external validation. However, use of the score at thresholds of three or less would allow identification of very low-risk patients (NPV ≥0.99) who could be rapidly discharged using information collected at initial assessment. <h4>Conclusion</h4> The LMIC-PRIEST score shows good discrimination and high sensitivity at lower thresholds and can be used to rapidly identify low-risk patients in LMIC ED settings. <h4>What is already known on this subject</h4> Uneven vaccination in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) coupled with less resilient health care provision mean that emergency health care systems in LMICs may still be at risk of being overwhelmed during periods of increased COVID-19 infection. Risk-stratification scores may help rapidly triage need for hospitalisation. However, those proposed for use in the ED for patients with suspected COVID-19 have been developed and validated in high-income settings. <h4>What this study adds</h4> The LMIC-PRIEST score has been robustly developed using a large routine dataset from the Western Cape, South Africa and is directly applicable to existing triage practices in LMICs. External validation across both income settings and COVID-19 variants showed good discrimination and high sensitivity (at lower thresholds) to a composite outcome indicating need for inpatient admission from the ED <h4>How this study might affect research, practice or policy</h4> Use of the LMIC-PRIEST score at thresholds of three or less would allow identification of very low-risk patients (negative predictive value ≥0.99) across all settings assessed During periods of increased demand, this could allow the rapid identification and discharge of patients from the ED using information collected at initial assessment.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/11/07/2022.11.06.22281986.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.11.06.22281986; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR568016; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR568016&type=FILE&fileName=EMS156830-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

While global healthcare has been severely disrupted in the pandemic, the impact on access to psoriasis care and whether this may negatively influence vaccine uptake, is underexplored. <h4>Objectives</h4> To explore organisational and individual factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in individuals with psoriasis. <h4>Methods</h4> Individuals with psoriasis, identified through global patient organisations and social media, completed a cross-sectional self-reported online survey. The primary outcome was COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between predictor variables (organisational and individual factors) and outcome. <h4>Results</h4> Self-reported data from 802 individuals with psoriasis across 89 countries were available (65.6% female, median age 51 years [IQR 37-61], 43.7% taking systemic immunosuppression). Eight percent (n=63) reported vaccine hesitancy. Those reporting vaccine hesitancy were younger, more likely to be of non-white ethnicity, non-UK resident, have a lower BMI, not taking systemic immunosuppression and with shorter disease duration compared to those not reporting vaccine hesitancy. The commonest reasons for vaccine hesitancy were concerns regarding vaccine side-effects, that the vaccine is too new or that psoriasis may worsen post-vaccination. Forty percent (n=322) reported that their psoriasis care had been disrupted by the pandemic. These individuals were younger, of non-white ethnicity, with shorter duration and more severe psoriasis. Disruption to psoriasis care was associated with vaccine hesitancy (unadjusted OR 2.97 (95%CI 1.23-7.13), p=0.015), although not statistically significant in the adjusted model. <h4>Conclusion</h4> A minority of individuals with psoriasis from our study reported COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Similar to general population trends, vaccine hesitancy in our psoriasis sample is most common in younger age and ethnic minority groups. Our data highlight patient concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccination, which are important to address during patient-clinician interactions to help optimise vaccine uptake and mitigate risks from the ongoing pandemic in individuals with psoriasis. <h4>Key points</h4> <h4>What’s already known about this topic?</h4> The COVID-19 vaccine is highly efficacious at protecting against severe COVID-19 outcomes in the general population. Vaccine hesitancy (unwillingness to receive vaccination despite available vaccination services) poses a major threat to global public health and is more common in women, younger age and ethnic minority groups in the general population. Individuals with psoriasis taking systemic immunosuppression were considered at high risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes and prioritised for vaccination, however there is a paucity of information on vaccine hesitancy in this group, including contributing factors. While global healthcare has been severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, access to psoriasis care and its potential impact on vaccine hesitancy is underexplored. <h4>What does this study add?</h4> A substantial proportion (40%) of individuals with psoriasis reported disrupted access to psoriasis care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Disrupted care was most commonly reported in younger age and ethnic minority groups. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was reported by a minority (8%) of individuals with psoriasis. Those reporting vaccine hesitancy were younger and more likely to be of non-white ethnicity, in keeping with trends in the general population. The commonest reasons for vaccine hesitancy were concerns regarding vaccine side effects, that the vaccine is too new or that psoriasis may worsen post-vaccination. These concerns are important to address during patient-clinician interactions to help mitigate risks from the ongoing pandemic in individuals with psoriasis.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/01/23/2022.01.20.22269546.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.20.22269546; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR445586; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.20.22269546

However, findings are inconsistent across populations, and the interplay between weather, behavior, and depression has not been fully quantified. This study analyzed real-world data from 428 participants (a subset; 68.7% of the cohort) in the RADAR-MDD longitudinal mobile health study to investigate seasonal variations in depression (measured through a remote validated assessment - PHQ-8) and examine the potential interplay between dynamic weather changes, physical activity (monitored via wearables), and depression severity. The clustering of PHQ-8 scores identified four distinct seasonal variations in depression severity: one stable trend and three varying patterns where depression peaks in different seasons. Among these patterns, participants within the stable trend had the oldest average age (p = 0.002) and the lowest baseline PHQ-8 score (p = 0.003). Mediation analysis assessing the indirect effect of weather on physical activity and depression showed significant differences among participants with different affective responses to weather. Specifically, the temperature and day length significantly influenced depression severity, which in turn impacted physical activity levels (p < 0.001). For instance, among participants with a negative correlation between depression severity and temperature, a 10°C increase led to a total daily step count rise of 655.4, comprised of 461.7 steps directly due to the temperature itself and 193.7 steps because of decreased depressive severity (1.9 decrease in PHQ-8). In contrast, for those with a positive correlation, a 10°C rise directly led to a 262.3-step rise; however, it was offset by a 141.3-step decrease due to increased depression severity (2.1 increase in PHQ-8) from higher temperatures, culminating in an insignificant overall increase of 121 steps. These findings illustrate the heterogeneity in individuals' seasonal depression variations and responses to weather, underscoring the necessity for personalized approaches to help understand the impact of environmental factors on the real-world effectiveness of behavioral treatments.",,pdf:https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4254244/latest.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4254244/v1; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR839580; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR839580&type=FILE&fileName=EMS200550-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

The recording of patients’ ethnic groups in primary care can support research and efforts to achieve equity in service provision and outcomes; however the coding of ethnicity is known to present complex challenges. We therefore set out to describe ethnicity coding in detail with a view to supporting the use of this data in a wide range of settings, as part of wider efforts to robustly describe and define methods of using administrative data. <h4>Methods</h4> We describe the completeness and consistency of primary care ethnicity recording in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, containing linked primary care and hospital records in >25 million patients in England. We also compared the ethnic breakdown in OpenSAFELY-TPP with that of the 2021 UK census. <h4>Results</h4> 78.2% of patients registered in OpenSAFELY-TPP on 1 January 2022 had their ethnicity recorded in primary care records, rising to 92.5% when supplemented with hospital data. The completeness of ethnicity recording was higher for women than for men. The rate of primary care ethnicity recording ranged from 77% in the South East of England to 82.2% in the West Midlands. Ethnicity recording rates were higher in patients with chronic or other serious health conditions. For each of the five broad ethnicity groups, primary care recorded ethnicity was within 2.9 percentage points of the population rate as recorded in the 2021 Census for England as a whole. For patients with multiple ethnicity records, 98.7% of the latest recorded ethnicities matched the most frequently coded ethnicity. Patients whose latest recorded ethnicity was categorised as Other were most likely to have a discordant ethnicity recording (32.2%). <h4>Conclusions</h4> Primary care ethnicity data in OpenSAFELY is present for over three quarters of all patients, and combined with data from other sources can achieve a high level of completeness.

The Morecambe Bay Respiratory Network is an integrated care initiative operating in the North-West of England since 2017. A key target area has been reducing referrals to outpatient respiratory clinics by upskilling primary care teams. This study aims to explore space-time patterns in referrals from general practice in the Morecambe Bay area to evaluate the impact of the initiative. <h4>Methods</h4> Data on referrals to outpatient clinics and chronic respiratory disease patient counts between 2012-2020 were obtained from the Morecambe Bay Community Data Warehouse, a large store of routinely collected healthcare data. For analysis, the data is aggregated by year and small area geography. The methodology comprises of two parts. The first explores the issues that can arise when using routinely collected primary care data for space-time analysis and applies spatio-temporal conditional autoregressive modelling to adjust for data complexities. The second part models the rate of outpatient referral via a Poisson generalised linear mixed model that adjusts for changes in demographic factors and number of respiratory disease patients. <h4>Results</h4> The first year of the Morecambe Bay Respiratory Network was not associated with a significant difference in referral rate. However, the second and third years saw significant reductions in areas that had received intervention, with full intervention associated with a 31.8% (95% CI 17.0-43.9) and 40.5% (95% CI 27.5-50.9) decrease in referral rate, respectively. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Routinely collected data can be used to robustly evaluate key outcome measures of integrated care. The results demonstrate that effective integrated care has real potential to ease the burden on respiratory outpatient services by reducing the need for an onward referral. This is of great relevance given the current pressure on outpatient services globally, particularly long waiting lists following the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for more innovative models of care.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/08/06/2023.08.03.23293543.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.08.03.23293543; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR703638; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR703638&type=FILE&fileName=EMS184897-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Prevalence for any risk condition and for each individual condition is given overall and stratified by age and region. We repeated the analysis on 5 March 2014 for full regional representation and to describe prevalence of underlying health conditions in pregnancy. We additionally described the population of cancer survivors, and assessed the value of linked secondary care records for ascertaining COVID-19 at-risk status. <h4>Findings</h4> On 5 March 2019, 24·4% of the UK population were at risk due to a record of at least one underlying health condition, including 8·3% of school-aged children, 19·6% of working-aged adults, and 66·2% of individuals aged 70 years or more. 7·1% of the population had multimorbidity. The size of the at-risk population was stable over time comparing 2014 to 2019, despite increases in chronic liver disease and diabetes and decreases in chronic kidney disease and current asthma. Separately, 1·6% of the population had a new diagnosis of cancer in the past five years. <h4>Interpretation</h4> The population at risk of severe COVID-19 (aged ≥70 years, or with an underlying health condition) comprises 18.5 million individuals in the UK, including a considerable proportion of school-aged and working-aged individuals. <h4>Funding</h4> NIHR HPRU in Immunisation <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We searched Pubmed for peer-reviewed articles, preprints, and research reports on the size and distribution of the population at risk of severe COVID. We used the terms (1) risk factor or co-morbidity or similar (2) COVID or SARS or similar and (3) prevalence to search for studies aiming to quantify the COVID-19 at-risk UK population published in the previous year to 19 July 2020, with no language restrictions. We found one study which modelled prevalence of risk factors based on the Global Burden of Disease (which included the UK) and one study which estimated that 8.4 million individuals aged ≥30 years in the UK were at risk based on prevalence of a subset of relevant conditions in England. There were no studies which described the complete COVID-19 at-risk population across the UK. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> We used a large, nationally-representative dataset based on electronic health records to estimate prevalence of increased risk of severe COVID-19 across the United Kingdom, including all conditions in national guidance. We stratified by age, sex and region to enable regionally-tailored prediction of COVID-19-related healthcare burden and interventions to reduce transmission of infection, and planning and modelling of vaccination of the at-risk population. We also quantified the value of linked secondary care records to supplement primary care records. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Individuals at moderate or high risk of severe COVID-19 according to current national guidance (aged ≥70 years, or with a specified underlying health condition) comprise 18·5 million individuals in the United Kingdom, rather than the 8.43 million previously estimated. The 8·3% of school-aged children and 19·6% of working-aged adults considered at-risk according to national guidance emphasises the need to consider younger at-risk individuals in shielding policies and when re-opening schools and workplaces, but also supports prioritising vaccination based on age and condition-specific mortality risk, rather than targeting all individuals with underlying conditions, who form a large population even among younger age groups. Among individuals aged ≥70 years, 66·2% had at least one underlying health condition, suggesting an age-targeted approach to vaccination may efficiently target individuals at risk of severe COVID-19. These national estimates broadly support the use of Global Burden of Disease modelled estimates and age-targeted vaccination strategies in other countries.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/08/26/2020.08.24.20179192.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.24.20179192; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR205971; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR205971&type=FILE&fileName=EMS94289-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

It is important that healthcare organisations consider the specific context and mental, as well as physical, health needs of an ethnically diverse healthcare workforce in order to better support them during, and after, the COVID-19 pandemic. <h4>Methods</h4> We undertook a qualitative work package as part of the United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity and COVID-19 outcomes among healthcare workers (UK-REACH). As part of the qualitative research, we conducted focus group discussions with healthcare workers between December 2020 and July 2021, and covered topics such as their experiences, fears and concerns, and perceptions about safety and protection, while working during the pandemic. The purposive sample included ancillary health workers, doctors, nurses, midwives and allied health professionals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. We conducted discussions using Microsoft Teams. Recordings were transcribed and thematically analysed. <h4>Findings</h4> We carried out 16 focus groups with a total of 61 participants. Several factors were identified which contributed to, and potentially exacerbated, the poor mental health of ethnic minority healthcare workers during this period including anxiety (due to inconsistent protocols and policy); fear (of infection); trauma (due to increased exposure to severe illness and death); guilt (of potentially infecting loved ones); and stress (due to longer working hours and increased workload). <h4>Conclusion</h4> COVID-19 has affected the mental health of healthcare workers. We identified a number of factors which may be contributing to a deterioration in mental health across diverse ethnic groups. Healthcare organisations should consider developing strategies to counter the negative impact of these factors. This paper will help employers of healthcare workers and other relevant policy makers better understand the wider implications and potential risks of COVID-19 and assist in developing strategies to safeguard the mental health of these healthcare workers going forward, and reduce ethnic disparities. <h4>Key messages</h4> <h4>What is already known about this subject</h4> Healthcare Workers (HCWs) are experiencing deterioration of their mental health due to COVID-19 Ethnic minority populations and HCWs are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 More research is needed on the specific factors influencing the mental health of ethnically diverse healthcare workforces <h4>What are the new findings</h4> Prominent factors influencing the mental health and emotional wellbeing of this population include: anxiety (due to inconsistent protocols and policy) fear (of infection) trauma (due to increased exposure to severe illness and death) guilt (of potentially infecting loved ones) stress (due to longer working hours and increased workload) <h4>How might this impact on policy or clinical practice in the foreseeable future</h4> Healthcare organisations should consider the specific circumstances of these staff and develop strategies to counter the negative impact of these factors and help safeguard the mental health of their staff",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/12/14/2021.12.13.21267718.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.13.21267718; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR433132; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR433132&type=FILE&fileName=EMS141782-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Here, we analyse China’s five most stringent city-level lockdowns during 2021, treating them as natural experiments that allow for examination of behavioural changes in millions of people before, during, and after the lockdowns via patterns in smartphone application use. We made three fundamental observations. First, physical and economic activity-related apps experienced a steep decline in use, yet those that provide daily necessities retained high usage. Second, apps that fulfilled lower-level human needs, such as working, socialising, information seeking, and entertainment, saw an immediate and substantial increase in screen time. Those that satisfied higher-level needs, such as education, only drew a delayed attention. Third, human behaviour demonstrated resilience as most routines resumed as lockdowns lifted. Nonetheless, long-term lifestyle changes were observed as significant numbers of people chose to continue working and learning online, becoming “digital residents.” We argue that lockdowns must be brief and carefully planned to minimise negative impacts on human life.

Combining a symptom-based predictive model for COVID-19 positivity and RT-PCR tests provided by the Department of Health we were able to estimate disease incidence, prevalence and effective reproduction number. Geographically granular estimates were used to highlight regions with rapidly increasing case numbers, or hotspots. <h4>Findings</h4> More than 2.8 million app users in England provided 120 million daily reports of their symptoms, and recorded the results of 170,000 PCR tests. On a national level our estimates of incidence and prevalence showed similar sensitivity to changes as two national community surveys: the ONS and REACT-1 studies. On 28 September 2020 we estimated 15,841 (95% CI 14,023-17,885) daily cases, a prevalence of 0.53% (95% CI 0.45-0.60), and R(t) of 1.17 (95% credible interval 1.15-1.19) in England. On a geographically granular level, on 28 September 2020 we detected 15 of the 20 regions with highest incidence according to Government test data, with indications that our method may be able to detect rapid case increases in regions where Government testing provision is more limited. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Self-reported data from mobile applications can provide an agile resource to inform policymakers during a fast-moving pandemic, serving as an independent and complementary resource to more traditional instruments for disease surveillance. <h4>Funding</h4> Zoe Global Limited, Department of Health, Wellcome Trust, EPSRC, NIHR, MRC, Alzheimer’s Society. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> To identify instances of the use of digital tools to perform COVID-19 surveillance, we searched PubMed for peer-reviewed articles between 1 January and 14 October 2020, using the keywords COVID-19 AND ((mobile application) OR (web tool) OR (digital survey)). Of the 382 results, we found eight that utilised user-reported data to ascertain a user’s COVID-19 status. Of these, none sought to provide disease surveillance on a national level, or to compare these predictions to other tools to ascertain their accuracy. Furthermore, none of these papers sought to use their data to highlight geographical areas of concern. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> To our knowledge, we provide the first demonstration of mobile technology to provide national-level disease surveillance. Using over 120 million reports from more than 2.8 million users across England, we estimate incidence, prevalence, and the effective reproduction number. We compare these estimates to those from national community surveys to understand the effectiveness of these digital tools. Furthermore, we demonstrate the large number of users can be used to provide disease surveillance with high geographical granularity, potentially providing a valuable source of information for policymakers seeking to understand the spread of the disease. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Our findings suggest that mobile technology can be used to provide real-time data on the national and local state of the pandemic, enabling policymakers to make informed decisions in a fast-moving pandemic.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/11/17/2020.10.26.20219659.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.26.20219659; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR230599; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR230599&type=FILE&fileName=EMS101636-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

The main exposure group was people included on a general practice learning disability register (LDR), with a subgroup of people classified as having profound or severe learning disability. We also identified patients with Down syndrome and cerebral palsy (whether or not on the learning disability register). <h4>Main outcome measures</h4> (i) COVID-19 related death, (ii) COVID-19 related hospitalisation. Non-COVID-19 related death was also explored. <h4>Results</h4> In wave 1, of 14,301,415 included individuals aged 16 and over, 90,095 (0.63%) were identified as being on the LDR. 30,173 COVID-related hospital admissions, 13,919 COVID-19 related deaths and 69,803 non-COVID deaths occurred; of which 538 (1.8%), 221 (1.6%) and 596 (0.85%) were among individuals on the LDR, respectively. In wave 2, 27,611 COVID-related hospital admissions, 17,933 COVID-19 related deaths and 54,171 non-COVID deaths occurred; of which 383 (1.4%), 260 (1.4%) and 470 (0.87%) were among individuals on the LDR. Wave 1 hazard ratios for individuals on the LDR, adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity and geographical location, were 5.3 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.9, 5.8) for COVID-19 related hospital admissions and 8.2 (95% CI: 7.1, 9.4) for COVID-19 related death. Wave 2 produced similar estimates. Associations were stronger among those classed as severe-profound and among those in residential care. Down syndrome and cerebral palsy were associated with increased hazard of both events in both waves; Down syndrome to a much greater extent. Hazards of non-COVID-19 related death followed similar patterns with weaker associations. <h4>Conclusions</h4> People with learning disabilities have markedly increased risks of hospitalisation and mortality from COVID-19. This raised risk is over and above that seen for non-COVID causes of death.

Data are extracted from four sources, recorded using five clinical terminologies and stored in different schemas. The aims of our research were to: a) develop a semi-supervised approach for bootstrapping EHR phenotyping algorithms in UKB EHR, and b) to evaluate our approach by implementing and evaluating phenotypes for 31 common biomarkers. <h4>Materials and Methods</h4> We describe an algorithmic approach to phenotyping biomarkers in primary care EHR involving a) bootstrapping definitions using existing phenotypes, b) excluding generic, rare or semantically distant terms, c) forward-mapping terminology terms, d) expert review, and e) data extraction. We evaluated the phenotypes by assessing the ability to reproduce known epidemiological associations with all-cause mortality using Cox proportional hazards models. <h4>Results</h4> We created and evaluated phenotyping algorithms for 31 biomarkers many of which are directly related to COVID–19 complications e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease. Our algorithm identified 1651 Read v2 and Clinical Terms Version 3 terms and automatically excluded 1228 terms.

We aimed to investigate whether ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 deaths were similar in the more recent “second wave” of the epidemic. Working on behalf of NHS England, we used primary care and linked ONS mortality data within the OpenSAFELY platform. All adults in the database at 1st September 2020 and with at least 1 year of prior follow-up and a record of ethnicity were included. The outcome was COVID-19-related death (death with COVID-19 listed as a cause of death on the death certificate). Follow-up was to 9th November 2020. Hazard ratios for ethnicity were calculated using Cox regression models adjusted for age and sex, and then further adjusted for deprivation. 13,223,154 people were included. During the study period, people of South Asian ethnicity were at higher risk of death due to COVID-19 than white people after adjusting for age and sex (HR = 3.47, 95% CI 2.99-4.03); the association attenuated somewhat on further adjustment for index of multiple deprivation (HR = 2.86, 2.46-3.33, Table 2). In contrast with the first wave of the epidemic, we found little evidence of a raised risk in black or other ethnic groups compared to white (HR for black vs white = 1.28, 0.87-1.88 adjusted for age and sex; and 1.01, 0.69-1.49 further adjusted for deprivation).

We estimated p.C282Y and p.H63D variant cumulative incidence of multiple clinical outcomes in a large community cohort. <h4>Design</h4> Prospective cohort study. <h4>Setting</h4> 22 assessment centres across England, Scotland, and Wales in the UK Biobank (2006-2010). <h4>Participants</h4> 451,270 participants genetically similar to the 1000-Genomes European reference population, with a mean 13.3-year follow-up through hospital inpatient, cancer registries and death certificate data. <h4>Main outcome measures</h4> Cox proportional hazard ratios of incident clinical outcomes and mortality in those with HFE p.C282Y-p.H63D mutations compared to those with no variants, stratified by sex and adjusted for age, assessment centre and genetic stratification. Cumulative incidences were estimated from age 40 to 80 years. <h4>Results</h4> 12.1% of p.C282Y+/+ males had baseline (mean age 57) haemochromatosis diagnoses, with age 80 cumulative incidence of 56.4%. 33.1% died vs. 25.4% without HFE variants (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.29, 95% CI: 1.12-1.48, p=4.7*10 -4 ); 27.9% vs 17.1% had joint replacements, 20.3% vs 8.3% had liver disease, and there was excess delirium, dementia, and Parkinson’s disease, but not depression. Associations, including excess mortality, were similar in the group undiagnosed with haemochromatosis. 3.4% of p.C282Y+/+ females had baseline haemochromatosis diagnoses, with cumulative age 80 incidence of 40.5%. There was excess incident liver disease (8.9% vs 6.8%; HR 1.62, 95% CI: 1.27-2.05, p=7.8*10 -5 ), joint replacements and delirium, with similar results in the undiagnosed. p.C282Y/p.H63D and p.H63D+/+ men or women had no statistically significant excess fatigue or depression at baseline and no excess incident outcomes. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Male and female p.C282Y homozygotes experienced greater excess morbidity than previously documented, including those undiagnosed with haemochromatosis in the community. As haemochromatosis diagnosis rates were low at baseline despite treatment being considered effective, trials of screening to identify people with p.C282Y homozygosity early appear justified. <h4>Strengths and limitations of this study</h4> We analyzed largescale data on community volunteers from the UK Biobank, one of the world’s largest HFE genotyped cohorts. We have analyzed incident disease outcomes during an extended follow-up period of mean 13.3 years. We have provided the first clinical outcome data to age 80 years in those with haemochromatosis genotypes, including those undiagnosed with haemochromatosis at baseline, expanding the life-course evidence on HFE penetrance. UK Biobank participants were somewhat healthier than the general population, but HFE allele frequencies were similar to previous UK studies. Incident outcomes were from hospital inpatient and cancer registry follow-up, so did not rely on potentially biased patient self-reporting, but community diagnosed conditions may be underestimated.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/11/17/2023.11.17.23298637.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.17.23298637; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR760672; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR760672&type=FILE&fileName=EMS191324-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We describe trends in risk of mortality among care home residents compared to residents in private homes in England. <h4>Methods</h4> On behalf of NHS England, we used OpenSAFELY-TPP, an analytics platform running across the linked electronic health records of approximately a third of the English population, to calculate monthly age-standardised risks of death due to all causes and COVID-19 among adults aged >=65 years between 1/2/2019 and 31/03/2021. Care home residents were identified using linkage to the Care and Quality Commission. <h4>Findings</h4> We included 4,329,078 people aged 65 years or older on the 1st of February 2019, 2.2% of whom were classified as residing in a care or nursing home. Age-standardised mortality risks were approximately 10 times higher among care home residents compared to non-residents in February 2019 residents (CMF = 10.59, 95%CI = 9.51, 11.81 among women, CMF = 10.82, 95%CI = 9.89, 11.84 among men). This increased to more than 17 times in April 2020 (CMF = 17.52, 95%CI = 16.38, 18.74 among women, CMF = 18.12, 95%CI = 17.17 – 19.12 among men) before returning to pre-pandemic levels in June 2020. CMFs did not increase during the second wave, despite a rise in the absolute age-standardised COVID-19 mortality risks. <h4>Interpretation</h4> The first COVID-19 wave had a disproportionate impact on care home residents in England compared to older private home residents. A degree of immunity, improved protective measures or changes in the underlying frailty of the populations may explain the lack of an increase in the relative mortality risks during the second wave. The care home population should be prioritised for measures aimed at controlling the spread of COVID-19. <h4>Funding</h4> Medical Research Council MR/V015737/1",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/07/08/2021.07.07.21253295.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.07.21253295; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR367589; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR367589&type=FILE&fileName=EMS130305-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Questions covered willingness to receive Covid-19 vaccination and attitudes to prioritisation. Descriptive statistics, unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and natural language processing of free-text responses are reported, and how changes over the first 50 days of both vaccination roll-out and new-variant impact modelling of anticipated transmission rates and the likelihood and time to herd immunity. <h4>Findings</h4> Compared with the week reporting the first efficacious vaccine there was a 15% increase in acceptance of Covid-19 vaccination, attributable in one third to the impact of the new variant, with 75% of respondents “shielding” – staying at home and not leaving unless essential – regardless of health status or tier rules. 12.5% of respondents plan to change their behaviour two weeks after completing vaccination compared with 45% intending to do so only when cases have reduced to a low level. Despite the increase from 71% to 86% over this critical 50-day period, modelling of planned uptake of vaccination remains below that required for rapid effective herd immunity – now estimated to be 90 percent in the presence of a new variant escalating R 0 to levels requiring further lockdowns. To inform the public messaging essential therefore to improve uptake, age and female gender were, respectively, strongly positively and negatively associated with wanting a vaccine. 22.7% disagreed with the prioritisation list, though 70.3% were against being able to expedite vaccination through payment. Teachers (988, 12.6%) and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) (837, 10.7%) groups were most cited by respondents for prioritisation. <h4>Interpretation</h4> In this sample, the growing impact of personal choice among the increasingly informed public highlights a decrease in Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy over time, with news of a new variant motivating increased willingness for vaccination but at levels below what may be required for effective herd immunity. We identify public preferences for next-in-line priorities, headed by teachers and BAME groups, consideration of which will help build trust and community engagement critical for maximising compliance with not only the vaccination programme but also all other public health measures.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/02/01/2021.01.30.21250083.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.30.21250083; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR276352; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR276352&type=FILE&fileName=EMS115671-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

People with psoriasis may be particularly vulnerable to this because of prevalent anxiety and depression, multimorbidity and therapeutic use of immunosuppression. <h4>Objective</h4> Characterise the factors associated with worsening psoriasis in the COVID-19 pandemic, using mental health status (anxiety and depression) as the main exposure of interest. <h4>Methods</h4> Global cross-sectional study using a primary outcome of self-reported worsening of psoriasis. Individuals with psoriasis completed an online self-report questionnaire (PsoProtect Me; Psoriasis Patient Registry for Outcomes, Therapy and Epidemiology of COVID-19 Infection Me ) between May 2020 and January 2021. Each individual completed a validated screen for anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-2). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression. <h4>Results</h4> 4,043 people with psoriasis (without COVID-19) from 86 countries self-reported to PsoProtect Me (mean age 47.2 years [SD 15.1]; mean BMI 27.6kg/m 2 [SD 6.0], 2,684 [66.4%] female and 3,016 [74.6%] of white European ethnicity). 1,728 (42.7%) participants (1322 [77%] female) reported worsening of their psoriasis in the pandemic.

Female sex, obesity, shielding behaviour and systemic immunosuppressant non-adherence also associated with worsening psoriasis. The commonest reason for non-adherence was concern regarding complications related to COVID-19. <h4>Conclusions</h4> These data indicate an association between poor mental health and worsening psoriasis in the pandemic. Access to holistic care including psychological support may mitigate potentially long-lasting effects of the pandemic on health outcomes in psoriasis. The study also highlights an urgent need to address patient concerns about immunosuppressant-related risks, which may be contributing to non-adherence.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/05/06/2021.05.04.21256507.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.04.21256507; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR334971; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR334971&type=FILE&fileName=EMS124099-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

The purpose of the consultation was to help finalise the proposals and contribute to the drafting of secondary legislation. We discussed these proposals as members of the Trials Methodology Research Partnership Adaptive Designs Working Group, which is jointly funded by the Medical Research Council and the National Institute for Health and Care Research. Two topics arose frequently in the discussion: the emphasis on legislation, and data sharing. It is our opinion that the proposals rely heavily on legislation to change practice. However, clinical trials are heterogeneous, and as a result some trials will struggle to comply with all of the proposed legislation. Furthermore, adaptive design clinical trials are even more heterogeneous than their non-adaptive counterparts, and face more challenges. Consequently, it is possible that increased legislation could have a greater negative impact on adaptive designs than non-adaptive designs. Overall, we are skeptical that the introduction of legislation will achieve the desired outcomes, with some exceptions. Meanwhile the topic of data sharing – making anonymised individual-level clinical trial data available to other investigators for further use – is entirely absent from the proposals. However, as an aspect of the wider concept of open science and reproducible research, data sharing is an increasingly important aspect of clinical trials. The benefits of data sharing include faster innovation, improved surveillance of drug safety and effectiveness and decreasing participant exposure to unnecessary risk. There are already a number of UK-focused documents that discuss and encourage data sharing, for example, the Concordat on Open Research Data and the Medical Research Council’s Data Sharing Policy. We strongly suggest that data sharing should be the norm rather than the exception, and hope that the forthcoming proposals on clinical trials  address this important topic.</p>",,pdf:https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2210654/latest.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2210654/v1; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR574413; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR574413&type=FILE&fileName=EMS157568-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

New policies aimed at tackling this increasing trend have been recommended by public health bodies and there is some evidence that progress is being made. We sought to extend our previous work and develop an unbiased, data-driven approach to identify general practices and clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) whose prescribing data suggest that interventions to reduce the prescribing of opioids may have been successfully implemented. <h4>Methods</h4> We analysed five years of prescribing data for three opioid prescribing measures: one capturing total opioid prescribing and two capturing regular prescribing of high dose opioids. Using a data-driven approach, we applied a modified version of our change detection Python library to identify changes in these measures over time, consistent with the successful implementation of an intervention. This analysis was carried out for general practices and CCGs, and organisations were ranked according to the change in prescribing rate. <h4>Results</h4> We present data for the three CCGs and practices demonstrating the biggest reduction in opioid prescribing across the three opioid prescribing measures. We observed a 40% drop in the regular prescribing of high dose opioids (measured as a percentage of regular opioids) in the highest ranked CCG (North Tyneside); a 99% drop in this same measure was found in several practices. Decile plots demonstrate that CCGs exhibiting large reductions in opioid prescribing do so via slow and gradual reductions over a long period of time (typically over two years); in contrast, practices exhibiting large reductions do so rapidly over a much shorter period of time. <h4>Conclusions</h4> By applying one of our existing analysis tools to a national dataset, we were able to rank NHS organisations by reduction in opioid prescribing rates. Highly ranked organisations are candidates for further qualitative research into intervention design and implementation. <h4>Contributions to the literature</h4> Demonstrating that a data-driven approach can identify and quantify changes in important clinical measures in publicly available NHS data Identifying changes in this way allows the unbiased identification of candidates for further qualitative research into intervention design and implementation Large reductions observed at the CCG level (which are more robust to local circumstances) demonstrate that it is possible to reduce opioid prescribing and that continued and wider success in reducing opioid prescribing is dependent, at least in part, to closing an implementation gap",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/06/29/2023.06.28.23291704.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.28.23291704; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR683580; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR683580&type=FILE&fileName=EMS178309-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

We aimed to evaluate NEWS2 for severe COVID outcome and identify and validate a set of routinely-collected blood and physiological parameters taken at hospital admission to improve the score. <h4>Methods</h4> Training cohorts comprised 1276 patients admitted to King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust with COVID-19 disease from 1 st March to 30 th April 2020. External validation cohorts included 5037 patients from four UK NHS Trusts (Guys and St Thomas’ Hospitals, University Hospitals Southampton, University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, University College London Hospitals), and two hospitals in Wuhan, China (Wuhan Sixth Hospital and Taikang Tongji Hospital). The outcome was severe COVID disease (transfer to intensive care unit or death) at 14 days after hospital admission. Age, physiological measures, blood biomarkers, sex, ethnicity and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular, respiratory and kidney diseases) measured at hospital admission were considered in the models. <h4>Results</h4> A baseline model of ‘NEWS2 + age’ had poor-to-moderate discrimination for severe COVID infection at 14 days (AUC in training sample = 0.700; 95% CI: 0.680, 0.722; Brier score = 0.192; 95% CI: 0.186, 0.197). A supplemented model adding eight routinely-collected blood and physiological parameters (supplemental oxygen flow rate, urea, age, oxygen saturation, CRP, estimated GFR, neutrophil count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio) improved discrimination (AUC = 0.735; 95% CI: 0.715, 0.757) and these improvements were replicated across five UK and non-UK sites. However, there was evidence of miscalibration with the model tending to underestimate risks in most sites. <h4>Conclusions</h4> NEWS2 score had poor-to-moderate discrimination for medium-term COVID outcome which raises questions about its use as a screening tool at hospital admission. Risk stratification was improved by including readily available blood and physiological parameters measured at hospital admission, but there was evidence of miscalibration in external sites. This highlights the need for a better understanding of the use of early warning scores for COVID. <h4>K ey messages </h4> The National Early Warning Score (NEWS2), currently recommended for stratification of severe COVID-19 disease in the UK, showed poor-to-moderate discrimination for medium-term outcomes (14-day transfer to ICU or death) among COVID-19 patients. Risk stratification was improved by the addition of routinely-measured blood and physiological parameters routinely at hospital admission (supplemental oxygen, urea, oxygen saturation, CRP, estimated GFR, neutrophil count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio) which provided moderate improvements in a risk stratification model for 14-day ICU/death. This improvement over NEWS2 alone was maintained across multiple hospital trusts but the model tended to be miscalibrated with risks of severe outcomes underestimated in most sites. We benefited from existing pipelines for informatics at KCH such as CogStack that allowed rapid extraction and processing of electronic health records. This methodological approach provided rapid insights and allowed us to overcome the complications associated with slow data centralisation approaches.",This study looks to improve the NEWS2 for COVID.

In this study, we describe the pattern of bed occupancy across England during the first wave of the pandemic, January 31st to June 5th 2020. <h4>Methods</h4> Bed availability and occupancy data was extracted from daily reports submitted by all English secondary care providers, between 27-Mar and 5-June. Two thresholds for ‘safe occupancy’ were utilized (85% as per Royal College of Emergency Medicine and 92% as per NHS Improvement). <h4>Findings</h4> At peak availability, there were 2711 additional beds compatible with mechanical ventilation across England, reflecting a 53% increase in capacity, and occupancy never exceeded 62%. A consequence of the repurposing of beds meant that at the trough, there were 8·7% (8,508) fewer general and acute (G&A) beds across England, but occupancy never exceeded 72%. The closest to (surge) capacity that any trust in England reached was 99·8% for general and acute beds. For beds compatible with mechanical ventilation there were 326 trust-days (3·7%) spent above 85% of surge capacity, and 154 trust-days (1·8%) spent above 92%. 23 trusts spent a cumulative 81 days at 100% saturation of their surge ventilator bed capacity (median number of days per trust = 1 [range: 1 to 17]). However, only 3 STPs (aggregates of geographically co-located trusts) reached 100% saturation of their mechanical ventilation beds. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Throughout the first wave of the pandemic, an adequate supply of all bed-types existed at a national level. Due to an unequal distribution of bed utilization, many trusts spent a significant period operating above ‘safe-occupancy’ thresholds, despite substantial capacity in geographically co-located trusts; a key operational issue to address in preparing for a potential second wave. <h4>Funding</h4> This study received no funding. <h4>Research In Context</h4> <h4>Evidence Before This Study</h4> We identified information sources describing COVID-19 related bed and mechanical ventilator demand modelling, as well as bed occupancy during the first wave of the pandemic by performing regular searches of MedRxiv, PubMed and Google, using the terms ‘COVID-19’, ‘mechanical ventilators’, ‘bed occupancy’, ‘England’, ‘UK’, ‘demand’, and ‘non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs)’, until June 20th, 2020. Two UK-specific studies were found that modelled the demand for mechanical ventilators, one of which incorporated sensitivity analysis based on the introduction of NPIs and found that their effects might prevent the healthcare system being overwhelmed. Separately, several news reports were found pertaining to a single hospital that reached ventilator capacity in England during the first wave of the pandemic, however, no single authoritative source was identified detailing impact across all hospital sites in England. <h4>Added Value of This Study</h4> This national study of hospital-level bed occupancy in England provides unique and timely insight into bed-specific resource utilization during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, nationally, and by specific (geographically defined) health footprints. We found evidence of an unequal distribution of resource utilization across England. Although occupancy of beds compatible with mechanical ventilation never exceeded 62% at the national level, 52 (30%) hospitals across England reached 100% saturation at some point during the first wave of the pandemic. Close examination of the geospatial data revealed that in the vast majority of circumstances there was relief capacity in geographically co-located hospitals. Over the first wave it was theoretically possible to markedly reduce (by 95.1%) the number of hospitals at 100% saturation of their mechanical ventilator bed capacity by redistributing patients to nearby hospitals. <h4>Implications Of All The Available Evidence</h4> Now-casting using routinely collected administrative data presents a robust approach to rapidly evaluate the effectiveness of national policies introduced to prevent a healthcare system being overwhelmed in the context of a pandemic illness. Early investment in operational field hospital and an independent sector network may yield more overtly positive results in the winter, when G&A occupancy-levels regularly exceed 92% in England, however, during the first wave of the pandemic they were under-utilized. Moreover, in the context of the non-pharmacological interventions utilized during the first wave of COVID-19, demand for beds and mechanical ventilators was much lower than initially predicted, but despite this many trust spent a significant period of time operating above ‘safe-occupancy’ thresholds. This finding demonstrates that it is vital that future demand (prediction) models reflect the nuances of local variation within a healthcare system. Failure to incorporate such geographical variation can misrepresent the likelihood of surpassing availability thresholds by averaging out over regions with relatively lower demand, and presents a key operational issue for policymakers to address in preparing for a potential second wave.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/07/01/2020.06.24.20139048.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.24.20139048; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR180013; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR180013&type=FILE&fileName=EMS88023-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

The objective of this study was to examine how diseases in a cluster of physical-mental health multimorbidity with a high all-cause mortality (psychosis, diabetes, and congestive heart failure) develop and coexist over time, and to assess the associated impact of different temporal sequences on mortality. Population-scale, individual-level, anonymised, linked, demographic, administrative and electronic health record data were modelled using multi-state models for 1,675,585 individuals over a 20-year period (2000–2019). Cox regression models were used to estimate baseline hazards for transitions between states, adjusted for gender, age, and area-level deprivation. Our findings suggest that the order of disease acquisition in physical-mental health multimorbidity had an important impact and complex relationship on patient mortality. Individuals developing diabetes, psychosis, and congestive heart failure, in that order, had an increased all-cause mortality rate compared to the development of the same conditions in a different order, resulting in the highest loss in expectation of life of 13 years at age 50 compared to the general population. Congestive heart failure as a single condition and in combination with psychosis had an equally high loss in expectation of life. Identification and therapeutic targets for psychosis and congestive heart failure may be beneficial within 5 years following an initial diagnosis of diabetes. The use of multi-state models offers a flexible framework to assess temporal sequences of diseases and associated patient outcomes, and allows identification of potential risk factors, screening opportunities, and therapeutic targets in multimorbidity.</p>",,pdf:https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1537576/latest.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1537576/v1; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR482486; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR482486&type=FILE&fileName=EMS144429-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Prioritisation tools using age, PRS for coronary artery disease and stroke, and conventional risk factors for CVD available within longitudinal primary care records were derived using sex-specific Cox models. Rescaling to account for the healthy cohort effect, we modelled the implications of initiating guideline-recommended statin therapy after prioritising individuals for invitation to a formal CVD risk assessment. <h4>Results</h4> 1,838 CVD events were observed over median follow up of 8.2 years. If primary care records were used to prioritise individuals for formal risk assessment using age- and sex-specific thresholds corresponding to 5% false negative rates then we would capture 65% and 43% events amongst men and women respectively. The numbers of men and women needed to be screened to prevent one CVD event (NNS) are 74 and 140 respectively. In contrast, adding PRS to both prioritisation and formal assessments, and selecting thresholds to capture the same number of events resulted in a NNS of 60 for men and 90 for women. <h4>Conclusion</h4> The use of PRS together with primary care records to prioritise individuals at highest risk of a CVD event for a formal CVD risk assessment can more efficiently prioritise those who need interventions the most than using primary care records alone.

Identification of the genetic variants associated with chronic sputum production in a disease agnostic sample could improve understanding of its causes and identify new molecular targets for treatment. <h4>Methods</h4> We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of chronic sputum production in UK Biobank. Signals meeting genome-wide significance (P<5×10 −8 ) were investigated in additional independent studies, were fine-mapped, and putative causal genes identified by gene expression analysis. GWAS of respiratory traits were interrogated to identify whether the signals were driven by existing respiratory disease amongst the cases and variants were further investigated for wider pleiotropic effects using phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). <h4>Findings</h4> From a GWAS of 9,714 cases and 48,471 controls, we identified six novel genome-wide significant signals for chronic sputum production including signals in the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) locus, chromosome 11 mucin locus (containing MUC2, MUC5AC and MUC5B ) and the FUT2 locus. The four common variant associations were supported by independent studies with a combined sample size of up to 2,203 cases and 17,627 controls. The mucin locus signal had previously been reported for association with moderate-to-severe asthma. The HLA signal was fine-mapped to an amino-acid change of threonine to arginine (frequency 36.8%) in HLA-DRB1 (HLA- DRB1 *03:147). The signal near FUT2 was associated with expression of several genes including FUT2 , for which the direction of effect was tissue dependent. Our PheWAS identified a wide range of associations. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Novel signals at the FUT2 and mucin loci highlight mucin fucosylation as a driver of chronic sputum production even in the absence of diagnosed respiratory disease and provide genetic support for this pathway as a target for therapeutic intervention.",,pdf:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/08/25/2022.01.11.22269075.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.11.22269075; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR441814; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR441814&type=FILE&fileName=EMS153324-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

This recall study aimed to recall volunteers from a British South Asian genetic cohort that were considered to be at high risk of cholestatic liver disease based on their genotype or phenotype. <h4>Methods</h4> Cases were defined as participants with rare (minor allele frequency <1%) heterozygous loss of function (LoF) variants in ABCB4 and ABCB11 (genotype re-call) or with a previous intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) diagnosis (ICD10 O26.6). Cases were matched 1:1 to controls. A detailed medical and family history was taken along with fasting anthropometric and transient elastography (TE) measurements and blood samples. <h4>Results</h4> Out of 22 eligible volunteers, 9 (41%) participated in the recall (8/9 genotype and 1/9 phenotype recall). Among the cases there were 5 ABCB4 LoF, 3 ABCB11 LoF, and 1 ICP phenotype. Of these, 6/9 (66.7%) were newly identified with a cholestatic phenotype (genotype re-call). Specifically, 3/6 (50%) had increased liver stiffness on TE with one also demonstrating abnormal liver blood tests. 2/6 (33.3%) experienced at least 2 cholestatic symptoms and an additional 1/6 (16.7%) demonstrated abnormal liver blood tests without increased liver stiffness. <h4>Conclusion</h4> This pilot study demonstrated new evidence of cholestatic liver disease in 66.7% of volunteers, underscoring the potential of rare heterozygous ABCB4/11 variants as markers for identifying individuals at high risk of developing cholestatic liver disease. Consequently, individuals at higher genetic risk benefit from monitoring, personalised treatment and prevention strategies for cholestatic liver disease. <h4>Plain language summary</h4> We aimed to identify British South Asians at high risk of liver disease due to specific genetic factors, such as issues with bile production or liver problems during pregnancy. We invited these individuals to a clinic, where we collected their medical and family history, conducted liver blood tests, and performed a scan to check for early signs of liver scarring. We found that nearly two out of three participants had undetected liver disease.

However, the promise of RMT data depends heavily on sustained user engagement over extended periods of time. Here we report a longitudinal qualitative study of the subjective experience of people with MDD engaging with RMTs, to provide insight into system usability and user experience and to provide the basis for future promotion of RMT use in research and clinical practice. Objective  We aimed to understand the subjective experience of long-term engagement with RMTs, through qualitative data collected throughout a longitudinal study of RMTs in MDD. The objectives were (1) to explore key themes associated with long-term RMT use, and (2) to identify recommendations for future system engagement. Methods  In this multisite, longitudinal qualitative research study, 124 semi-structured interviews were conducted with 99 participants across the United Kingdom, Spain, and The Netherlands at 3-month, 12-month, and 24-month timepoints during a study exploring RMT use (the Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse- Major Depressive Disorder study). Data was analysed using thematic analysis; interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded in the native language, with resulting quotes translated into English. Results  There were five main themes regarding the subjective experience of long-term RMT use: 1) research-related factors, 2) utility of RMTs for self-management, 3) technology-related factors, 4) clinical-related factors, and 5) system amendments and additions. Conclusions  The subjective experience of long-term RMT use can be considered from two main perspectives: a) experiential factors (how participants construct their experience of engaging with RMTs), and b) system factors (direct engagement with the technologies). A set of recommendations based on these strands is proposed, for both future research and the real-world implementation of RMTs into clinical practice. Future exploration of experiential engagement with RMTs will be key to successful use of RMTs in clinical care.</p>",,pdf:https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1622706/latest.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1622706/v1; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR490307; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR490307&type=FILE&fileName=EMS144894-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Metagenomic viral sequencing offers the potential of a diagnostic test for influenza which also provides insights on transmission, evolution and drug resistance, and simultaneously detects other viruses. We therefore set out to apply Oxford Nanopore Technology to metagenomic sequencing of respiratory samples. We generated influenza reads down to a limit of detection of 10 2 -10 3 genome copies/ml in pooled samples, observing a strong relationship between the viral titre and the proportion of influenza reads (p = 4.7×10 -5 ). Applying our methods to clinical throat swabs, we generated influenza reads for 27/27 samples with high-to-mid viral titres (Cycle threshold (Ct) values <30) and 6/13 samples with low viral titres (Ct values 30-40). No false positive reads were generated from 10 influenza-negative samples. Thus Nanopore sequencing operated with 83% sensitivity (95% CI 67-93%) and 100% specificity (95% CI 69-100%) compared to the current diagnostic standard. Coverage of full length virus was dependent on sample composition, being negatively influenced by increased host and bacterial reads. However, at high influenza titres, we were able to reconstruct >99% complete sequence for all eight gene segments. We also detected Human Coronavirus and generated a near complete Human Metapneumovirus genome from clinical samples. While further optimisation is required to improve sensitivity, this approach shows promise for the Nanopore platform to be used in the diagnosis and genetic analysis of influenza and other respiratory viruses.",,pdf:https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/06/19/676155.full.pdf; doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/676155; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR82820; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR82820&type=FILE&fileName=EMS163028-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf

Although distinct in their clinical presentations, they likely represent differential expressions of a dysregulated threat-response system. Here we present a genome-wide association meta-analysis comprising 122,341 European ancestry ANX cases and 729,881 controls. We identified 58 independent genome-wide significant ANX risk variants and 66 genes with robust biological support. In an independent sample of 1,175,012 self-report ANX cases and 1,956,379 controls, 51 of the 58 associated variants were replicated. As predicted by twin studies, we found substantial genetic correlation between ANX and depression, neuroticism, and other internalizing phenotypes. Follow-up analyses demonstrated enrichment in all major brain regions and highlighted GABAergic signaling as one potential mechanism underlying ANX genetic risk. These results advance our understanding of the genetic architecture of ANX and prioritize genes for functional follow-up studies.",,doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.03.24309466; html:https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR877698; pdf:https://europepmc.org/api/fulltextRepo?pprId=PPR877698&type=FILE&fileName=EMS197362-pdf.pdf&mimeType=application/pdf
